They were so very lucky the capital Police didnt use their weapons Police have the right to defend themselves, and its illegal to put your hands or objects on a police officer. The police defended as patriotic Heroes. The one person whom was shot was intentionally breaking the LAW and with treats to the lives inside the building. Our LAWS will be followed. Our Police will never be hurt by mini maga extremists again. That Mother did not teach about the meaning and consequences of brainwashing, so i am only am sad about a death not the reason for that death which is justified by the majority of the people. i feel sorry for her and now especially that those mini magas have influenced mom as well. It will be over soon, magas are a small number of brainwashed certain area people whom are easily influenced. and many grow older by the day. BYE BYE evil.

If the public pressure was real Biden would have done this earlier. Instead he waited until basically the day after the Georgia runoff to ensure the 51-49 Senate lead for his party.
The timing is too coincidental. He knew this would be unpopular at home and would be heavily criticized and hurt his party at the ballot box. He does this the day after the last vote is in, announces it and hopes that everyone forgets in 2 years before the next election. The only surprise of this whole thing is he announced in on a Thursday and didn't do the classic Friday afternoon bad news drop.

The whole reason why the deal included Griner and Bout was based on division. Now there are two sides to the whole debate, Democrats who view it as a step in the right direction to help an American who was in need of help from their government and Republicans who see it as an issue that a black, lesbian, basketball player was traded for a lord of war.

The trade couldn't have gone any better for Putin, he received an ally of the Russian government, the US received a citizen in need of help, and now Russian bots can push their beliefs against others they seem undesirable while dividing the US even further over an issue that, arguably, doesn't even matter to the lives of the average American.
When the fascists are terrified that their reign is coming to an end they resort to violence and intimidation, anything to stop the voice of the people.
Unfortunately state run propaganda continues to hide their actions, but we keep seeing the cracks growing.

This is what we've been seeing for the last few months. Both the military and political feudal lords are terrified that the people are voicing their opinion and their uncontrolled corruption may end.

Imran was ousted through a democratic and constitutional vote of no confidence, and he’s been stoking violence across the country ever since. PMLN may not be a whole lot better, but Imran is 100% a wannabe fascist (dissolving the NA, jailing more journalists than any previous admin, attacking the judiciary, etc).

As an American, I think UK politics are more fun. If there were easily available English translations of other European Parliaments, I'd watch the fuck out of them.
As a Slovene, I can say the same. Our dumb prime minister said a while ago that the Western Balkans are on Russia's side. Our dumb foreign minister said there can be no peace or stability in Europe without Russia. We're still waiting for comments from our dumb Karen of a president. It's a shitshow, led by sympathizers of the old communist regime.

I see. Could Croatia confiscate the yachts belonging to those sanctioned individuals at least? And then sell them to the highest bidder and give the money to Ukraine, or something.
I mean, they use the word ‘revive’ here, but viruses aren’t technically alive. It’s a strand of RNA inside a protein capsule that can’t move, can’t eat, can’t breathe, can’t excrete, and only can bind to a cell and trick it into incorporating it’s genetic material into its host, where it instructs the cell to replicate copies of itself.
Viruses need to evolve alongside its hosts so as to keep being able to infect them through the long cycles of natural change and selection. We have a 50000 years a head start on these specific little beasties, so we’ll be fine. This is why new and contemporary viruses like COVID-19 are far more of a threat to us, by the way. They are the kinds that have mutated in ways that can afflict modern humanity and not our stone age hunter-gathering ancestors or our neanderthal cousins.

50000 years ago humanity was in it’s infancy. We’ve had 50000 years to evolve and change and develop. We aren’t the same creatures we once were that made us susceptible to such ancient viruses. It might not even be able to bind to our cell membranes anymore, or it’s genome might no longer be compatible with ours, or it may be extremely vulnerable to our current immune system, or so on.

Honestly I’m just drawing on my fascination and out of school interest in history with my three years of high school biology. I’m not an expert by any means, but I know the very basics as to how viruses work.

But it is like digging up an ancient roman coin. Or a fossil that is really well preserved because it has been buried in sediment for 20000 years. It’s interesting and certainly a historical treasure. But we don’t go around calling it a “supernatural voodoo coin” or “magical zombie fossil” now do we?

What would call opening a tomb of an Egyptian king? It’s a historical treasure that strangely becomes the subject of movies filled with supernatural voodoo… but voodoo is a specific type of dark magic from a specific area on the globe, particularly vile, but not a catch all of evil magic.

You probably don’t have anything to worry about. Viruses are only designed to attack a specific cell or group of cells. And even if this one against all odds evolved to attack or was able to attack one of our cells, it might not be able to anymore.

It is a fact that this shooting will not receive the same news coverage if the shooter is not a white guy. Which is still technically an if but I am highly doubtful he is since there is no mention of the race. If that fact bothers you then your anger should be with the media cooperations who make it so, not my comment on reddit pointing it out.

You’re literally posting in a politics sub. I have no issues improving the voting process, but we have one side claiming irregularities with zero evidence; that is not good faith criticism, that is sore loserism and a lack of respect for our democratic process. Plus they offer no actual solutions, and the plans they do support actively make voting worse for many people.
Probably. This is a country that at one point had a mass compulsory sterilization program in the 1970s. They might not go as far as that specifically, but somewhere close.
Not really. India already has one of the strictest gun control laws. Owning a gun for an individual legally is very very hard. Whatever is being done in Punjab is just to appease people after the outrage of Punjabi singer who was murdered recently.

Compared to Pakistan, India's gun laws have been pretty strict. Under the , which sets up much of the regulatory framework with regards to civilian small arms, ownership is a licensed matter. Under Article 14 of the Arms Act 1959, issuing authorities are granted significant discretion in issuing licenses, and are limited by legislation from issuing anything more than what the law deems suitable for certain purposes. Even shortening the barrel of a firearm requires a license.

Anti-personnel mines are, especially the ones the Russians are using which are just complete and utter war crimes, however anti-tank mines are very cool indeed when used appropriately. Stick 'em nice and visible on a road, now your enemy has 2 choices, use another road, or stay hours at that one cleaning them up, meanwhile your pre-ranged artillery can hit 'em hard.

They are ok, if the mines are actually mapped correctly. For example how to prevent the enemy from disarming AT mines? Place some god damn anti personnel mines around them.
Nah, we just realized there are other things more important than top speed in a fighter. The F-22 can do 2.25, the F-35 can only do 1.6, the F/A-18 can do 1.8, the F-15 can do 2.5, but all of them would demolish Russian planes in actual combat.
That having been said, the F-15, F-16, and F-22 can all still do it, so it's not like it's a rare thing these days either. It's just not really a handicap in terms of actual combat effectiveness either that the F-35 and F/A-18 can't.

Mostly because we realized it's kinda pointless. It takes a lot of fuel and a long time to get to that speed, and in actual war, it's rarely useful. Nearly every fighter and interceptor in Vietnam was capable of Mach 2, and almost none of them ever spent much time even just over Mach 1.5.

I’m aware, but to say Mach 2 is kinda pathetic as if there are planes going faster just simply isn’t accurate.

To anyone confused: type 1 diabetes is generally diagnosed in youth (of course there are exceptions), and ALL type 1s need insulin to live. Pretty much everyone who’s a type 1 diabetic is still screwed, aside from the lucky ones who’ve made it to 65. But that’s a VERY tiny percentage of us.

I don’t know any type 1 diabetics over 65, personally. The vast VAST majority of diabetics over that age are type 2. If they need insulin, I’m glad they’re able to get it now, but this isn’t even close to helping solve the insulin situation for the people that need it most.

But the general public has zero knowledge of the differences between type 1 and 2, and really overestimate the percentage of insulin dependent diabetics that qualify for this .

Yeah type 1 is the genetically fucked not your fault but uncared-for diabetics in the USA. Type 2 are the generally shitty lifestyle types (I know it can be stress, etc but predominantly it's poor life choices c'mon now).
All that ass kissing. If the judge had it in their mind to let the guy off they could at least do it quietly instead this spectacle of ass kissing. If this judge is on the ballot next election cycle and you vote for this clown then you are just as responsible for this crap as the judge and the cop.
Realistically though, how many people are actually going to remember her name or what she did when they see it on the ballot? Probably not enough to matter. I still want to try but it's depressing that this corruption is so blatant and hardly anyone seems to care.

This should not be hard to understand, but voters always seem so damn confused by it. Democrats represent the people regardless of who you vote for. Republicans represent their rich, and often foreign, donors.

Also there are multiple jurisdictions, different investigations and both state and federal charges..

How about we let the investigations finish. We just learned today that Mark Meadows was burning documents. I don't understand why people think they know enough about what's going on. Do you want him arrested, or do you want him prosecuted and found guilty?

That is not how it works. Every charge is separate. You don't have to wait for everything to be complete, you can charge him with what is know now and charge him with the rest later.

Except...... tick-tock, you know? The longer they stand around with their thumbs up their asses, the bolder the wolves become. They have to charge him or democracy is over....and they have do it now. And they have to go after all the government officials who were involved. Very soon it will be too late. The Nazis are practicing blowing up power stations for fucks sake.

I never said that. I said we should let the investigations finish. If they were to bring charges they would. I was trying to explain that we are actually in no position to know what they're investigating, let alone whether or not they're ready to file any charges.

They will bring charges when they have a case that can win. None of us know what's going on or what information and evidence they have.
I hate to say this bc I'm very disappointed, disgusted, etc etc with Russia and cannot stand them, well the government. I wholeheartedly hate them with a passion. But it seems like people should just drop the "whole war crime thing" because evidently not one country will do anything about it outside of some gd sanctions. I get the whole gist that well if the US does something then ww3. I am at this point either do something about with force or quit complaining about war crimes bc at this point I'm just fed up. Obviously not at the same level of the poor Ukrainians who have to actually live throughout the hell day in and day out. I honestly believe its way past time that nato actually steps in bc the only the west is doing is letting this scumbag get away with some of the worst atrocities that the world has seen in a veeeerry long time... From mass kidnapping on a massive scale to bombing hospitals, schools, cancer wards, gunning down innocent civilians standing in line to buy bread and ice, bombing their apartment complexes, raping women and children, etc... I could go on and on for days. I just believe we are at the point its time for the leader of the free world to step up and put a stop to this horrible shit. I'm sorry for ranting like this but enough is enough... Bc i believe just like the whole holocaust ordeal that basically nobody will be punished for these war crimes. I do think Putler is only playing the card he has left and that is saying he'll use nukes. But it's just a bluff. If he was going to do it, he'd already have done it. From what I've read from their leaked reports if they nuke Ukraine then that is basically admitting defeat if they have to resort to such BS like nukes. I say either literally give Ukraine the best of the best equipment that can use with much further range or put nato boots on the ground in ukraine. I believe the only way Ukraine should attack into the Russian borders is to retaliate from where a long range missile was fired then they should have the green light to fire back at said bases inside Russia. It's time to actually put a stop to this sick sorry piece of shit.
Just imagine for one second, how many war crimes are in the occupied areas that can't be currently accessed. I can only imagine and it isnt good. In Izyum alone there were mass graves of 400-1000. Just one town. Id be surprised if the number of rapes was lower.
I mean she handled that case like a pro. But it was also a black and white case. Darrell Brooks is a monster and that’s something both liberals and conservatives agree on. All Judge Dorow had to do was not fuck it up. The bar is so low for judges these days I understand why people were impressed. But the Supreme Court is full of nuanced cases and politics, and judge Dorow made it clear she would bring conservative insanity to that court and any rulings that allowed her own brand of judicial activism.
The latter election is to fill the seat of late-Representative Donald McEachin, who died late last year of cancer. It was called shortly after close of polls for the Democratic candidate, state senator Jennifer McClellan, who will be the first Black woman elected to Congress from Virginia.

Barrett is bad for the court because she's an under qualified puppet that was just picked by Trump getting blindfolded in a room full of Republicans and spinning around while pointing. When he was too tired to keep spinning (3/4 of a spin), he was pointing at Barrett. There were tons of people that deserve the job more than her.

Gorsuch, surprisingly, is one of the foremost experts on tribal law in the US. He will likely side with the three liberal judges leaving Roberts as the swing vote.

He strikes me as a guy who I can have disagreements with but still respect. I personally don’t think originalism is the proper interpretive method for the Constitution, but I understand why Gorsuch does and I don’t think he’s inherently bad for the country the way Thomas and Alito and Barrett are.

On the politically motivated angle, it's was probably about money before it was about a difference in a political opinion. Yeah, nuts are starting to target politicians, not good. But that's not the first thing I'd suspect. She was probably an obstacle to someone. Qui bono?

Well I've not read anything about a robbery, this was clearly an execution. So either it was senselessly random, the result of some personal vendetta by someone she knew, or as you said politically motivated. I'm gonna guess the latter is probably the most likely option.

Am I missing something here, or does this post completely ignore the reality of just about every civil war or domestic genocide or ethnic cleansing ever?
We need to stop demonizing people who we have tensions with and trying to appeal to their more accommodating section of their population and let them lead the change. These people are willing to act as a shield. When the incidence of outrage reaches it's absolute point, it will reflect what kind of change they are willing to fight for. When young jews are ordered to shoot other jews in protest, how will the nationalists deny they haven't murdered their own. The schism is real there and obviously being on the correct side of history feels much more appealing. Let's stamp out all forms of organized fascist conspiracies.

Easy - they turn them in to "others" same way they always do. They're not Israelis - they're traitors that want to destroy the Jewish people and drive us from our homeland. There's nothing new about this playbook, and fascists necessarily don't have a strong relationship with reason or truth. I'm all for supporting local elements opposing fascism, but we need to recognise the steps that are taken to prime people for genocide. Look at the rhetoric of the Republican Party for examples of the spectrum of how this is done - targeting leftists, "sexual deviants", minorities, women, the poor, etc.
Republicans should take a moment and realize, understand that you are the reason Biden is so appealing. Every time you guys boo him and detract from him we ask ourselves why? And when we do we see he's right way too often and think this guy isn't so bad after all. It's hard to complain about Biden when you haven't offered us anyone better. Trump is a trainwreck, an impulsive and short sighted pathological liar. DeSantis is arguably even worse. Try electing someone who doesn't openly despise and antagonise people who are different from them. It's a lot different than Democrats antagonizing Republicans for their beliefs because we choose what we believe. Republicans attack people for being trans, woke, gay, black or female. That's way worse because people don't choose those things.

When I was in Korea, I walked into an establishment and everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at me. The lady at the door pushed me back out the door and said no Americans I understand there are some businesses like this they just don’t want foreigners in their businesses. That’s fine it could have been for their or my safety that I was not allowed there. I don’t really care if I as a white guy am not allowed somewhere no need to get my feathers ruffled I just pretend that the place does not exist and go about my life. Why get upset because a business doesn’t want us there.
Wow, this hits home. I lived in Taichung for 4 years about a decade ago. I've actually been to this bar a few times, but never had issues there. There is definitely a weird vibe in Taichung bars, for some reason. I always heard stories about gangsters taking offence that some white guy had tried to dance with one of their girlfriends and beating the hell out of every foreigner in the bar as a result. "White guys cause problems" might be the other side of the story, though. I doubt the bar will be able to get away with this for long.

I question whether or not the reactions are massive enough, honestly. The very best case scenario for this is they are trolling some 3D chess move into a news cycle and treating the legislature like a circus. Worst case scenario is that they don't think she's insane.

So you're saying "both sides are the same"? Both sides are equally bad? Gotta disagree buddy. The party putting on the circus instead of governing is not the same as the party calling out the circus.

Virginia's 2nd District: Luria (D-incumbent) vs Kiggans (R) - It's a toss up, so if Luria wins, it's good news for dems. If Luria loses outright, it is a bad sign. If it's too close to call for a good chunk of the night, then things are going about as expected.

Virginia's 7th District: Spanberger (D-incumbent) vs Vega (R) - This is a +6 Biden district and Spanberger should win the race. If she loses, it's likely going to be a bad night for Dems. If it's too close to call, then that's also not a great sign. If she wins, things are looking okay for Dems.

New York's 17th District: Sean Patrick Maloney (D-incumbent) vs Lawler (R) - Sean Patrick Maloney is the chair of the House Democrats campaign arm and is unexpectedly facing a pretty close race. It's a toss up right now. If he hangs on to his seat, that's a great sign for Democrats.

Michigan Governor's Race: Whitmer (D-incumbent) vs Dixon (R) - Whitmer is expected to win this race, which should bode well for down ballot candidates. Keep an eye out for how close it is though; if it's in the low single digits, then that suggests a better night than anticipated for Republicans.

Watch Miami-Dade County in Florida. If it stays blue, that's a good sign. If it goes red, that would be the first time in decades. The margin is important.
I wouldn’t be so sure of this. Georgia’s population is highly concentrated into a few cities, which skew very democrat. For example, 50% of Georgia’s population lives in the greater Atlanta area and an additional 5% lives in the cities of Macon, Augusta, Savannah, and Columbus. Judging by vote recipient for down ticket offices is not that reliable because as a Georgia voter myself, many of those candidates run unopposed and many voters do not view these offices as political in nature. I have no issue voting for a republican coroner even though I am a pretty staunch democrat because it’s not really a political office in any meaningful way.

States that had a Republican governor running for re-election tended to outperform nearby states. Had governors like Kemp, DeWine, etc. not been on the ticket I suspect the outcome would've been different.

Hm, almost like every state and locality is different, and candidates should be running based on what their electorate looks like instead of mirroring national platforms.

A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.

It was extremely effective in 2012 (based on the 2010 Census and the gerrymandering done from that), and got republicans a 33 seat lead even though democrats received 1 million more votes overall than republicans did.

While it must be acknowledged that the Dems do this also, it would be disingenuous to claim it’s truly a "both sides" thing. Yes there are Dem jurisdictions that pull this shit too, while too a much much lesser extent.
This speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese governance. The ones with true power, like Jiang, don't need to hold office. Jiang stacked the party with loyalists so he could be certain he would be able to continue influencing politics despite being formally retired. Xi needs a third term because he lacks a clique he can continue to influence upon retirement.
Despite no longer being general secretary, Jiang still remained in charge of the military during the first year of Hu Jintao's term. Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference.

Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference. A WikiLeaks transcript showed Hillary Clinton informing her private audience that China's foreign policy was ultimately controlled by their military establishment, not Hu.
If you criticize Xi for underhandedly cementing power by enshrining Xi Jinping Thought into the constitution, you should also criticize Jiang for doing the same when he enshrined his "Three Represents" ideology into the constitution.

It's much more complicated than that, and not at all like the Jan 6 event in the US, because Jiang still had power after officially leaving office, where Trump had only influence.

Political cults like Falun Gong are not new to China. The Taiping Rebellion was started by a political cult, and more people died in the Taiping Rebellion than in WW1.

Falun Gong is China's version of QAnon. China's solution was heavy-handed, but most Chinese would argue it was necessary to prevent the unrest we in the US have to deal with due to our political cult, QAnon.

They weren't a political cult, either, they began as a spiritual movement and were forced to take a political stance by persecution.

Jiang (and all Chinese leaders) are not afraid of religious movements in general, they are afraid of any institution that threatens the CPC's authority over China. Most sects of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity are tolerated, as long as they keep they promise to never question the CPC or discuss political issues. Tibetan Buddhism and Islam in Xinjiang were suppressed because they were afraid of separatist movements. Jehovah's Witness was banned because it taught its followers to refuse to swear allegiance to a specific nation. However, Hui Islam, Mahayana Buddhism, and the Catholic Patriotic Association are tolerated because they don't conflict with the CPC's political agenda.

A foundational belief of Falun Gong is that the CPC is illegitimate, so it's not a surprise they got suppressed. I'm not shedding any tears, it was an insanely racist cult. Li Hongzhi is not an idiot, he knows he can't actually levitate, he's just making this stuff up to build a following in order to influence Chinese politics.

His "ability to maintain good relationships with western powers" is BS. He oversaw the third cross-strait crisis. The only reason you don't remember the times he disagreed with the West is because we never took China seriously as a potential peer competitor. Back then, we could silence China's disapproval of a Taiwanese leader with a basic naval exercise. Jiang and Xi's policies towards the West haven't changed, most of the change comes from the West not being as cooperative because it realizes China is an imminent threat to it's hegemony.

Never thought I'd see the day where Westerners praise Jiang. Just goes to show how easily Westerners forget about the past to eat up the new narrative about why this time, China's leader is really bad.

Jiang had a unique view of the US. While he believed the American values were incompatible with China, he still respected America. He memorized excerpts from the US Declaration of Independence and Gettysburg Address. He was the last mainland president to go on 60 Minutes. Jiang cared less about ideological purity, and more about understanding the values of other countries. That is what sers him apart from the current general secretary of China.
Of course I want NATO and the US to supply Ukraine with even more and it is frustrating to see them refuse to supply long range munitions while my relatives have to hide in the basement from missile strikes, but I'm also grateful that NATO and other nations have provided so much and continue to assert their support for Ukraine. If support was not provided - both when the war started in 2014 and when it escalated in 2022 - I know that people would have still fought against Russia but it would have been even more brutal and difficult for the people to stand against Russian imperialism.
But at least the average Russian knows what they're dying for. Palaces and yachts that they'll never be allowed within 20km of.

Do newer spellings with "ê" have the same pronunciation as the antiquated version? I have no knowledge of French pronunciation, but I'm assuming it is just a spelling modernization, like an Eszett in German?
Well, there's something to learn when relations start to deteriorate like this. (Aside from the motive, just to focus on the sanction itself. Maybe after this Brazil will rethink their dependency regarding the supplychain for key items(the context is unpleasant, but the opportunity to learn is still here). Everybody gotta be as self-sufficient as they can. Also, I don't understand the reasoning for that move by Germany. I think I understand what it is meant to signal, but not the reasoning itself. But it is what it is. Seems like they aren't gonna do business as usual to countries that don't send weapons to Ukraine. Rather harsh(especially form Brazil's perspective), but hey, at least it further motivates much needed discussions inside Brazil. So far I focused on the impact to brazilian industry(just a topic that interests me for a handful of years already), but some discussions are also being held regarding Brazil's position in the war up until now.
Didn't Dire Straits once approach a police officer and ask for help stating "we're in dire straits", but the police officer hadn't heard of them and thought they were actually in some sort of emergency?

I live in Georgia and feel the runoffs are gonna be closer than they should be. How do you reach Republican voters that are voting for Walker despite all of his issues? I know several people that are voting for Walker simply because he’s a Republican, even though they can’t stand him. They think Warnock is automatically worse than Walker simply because he’s a Democrat.

Also, given that this race could give Democrats an edge in the Senate, GOP Georgia voters may be more energized about making sure that doesn’t happen and that’s a big driver too.

Nice to hear from a Georgia resident! Yes, this is shaping up to be a SO close - if current polling is accurate. I don’t have any suggestions on how to message to voters, but midterm races usually draw voters who are party loyalists. Those are the folks who turnout. That could be part of the reason why republican voters are supporting a candidate who is not traditional.

Yes, but you've told us that what you hear directly from voters is far more informative than "current polling"!

What is the back-back-back story of Walker getting into the race? He is so obviously inappropriate for the position, yet he has had enough support to give him a real possibility of getting into the Senate? How can voters equate a football star with the intellectual acuity necessary for a position in Congress? What does it say about Georgia voters in general that someone so inadequate can be elected?

Nice question, the quick answer is you go into the interview with your facts ready as much as possible! This has always been an issue for most reporters covering all sorts of topics. The best way I’ve learned to combat it is to re-ask questions, point out the facts and sometimes ask them to share where the info that doesn’t seem quite right is coming from. I think most political reporters (especially those of us on-air) are aware that spin almost always happens, so be ready.

Honestly, the polling in this midterm cycle fascinated me months ago. There were trends in places like Washinon state and Iowa where senators deemed “safe” were seeing mixed polling of being far ahead and then being down significantly.

One thing that I kept thinking about on election night when the red wave didn’t happen, is a conversation I had with a political scientist who pointed out that polling might be off and continue to be off, simply because some polls haven’t caught up to the reality of how we live. Many people don’t answer landlines, making the pool of respondents far smaller and less diverse, so you might not get a good gauge of voter sentiment. On top of that, there is also a phenomenon some have mused that you may have people say they will vote for Candidate XYZ when asked over the phone by a stranger, but that may not be the reality when they actually get to the ballot box.

The bottom line for me as a journalist has always been that polls can be a tool to keep in the back of your mind, but go talk to voters and listen to what they are telling you.

Unfortunately, yes, I’d say we are all more aware of this type of violence than when I started my career. It’s something you do keep in your mind when on certain assignments. It’s also really important these days for many reporters to seek training on how to handle it.

It appears he has property in Georgia and Texas, that’s what we know. We also know he has said he lives in Texas publicly, in speeches and campaign events. I’m interested in hearing what Georgia voters tell us about how much of a concern this is. For instance, we saw in the PA senate race that some voters there said they were troubled that Dr. Oz Mehmet who had a house in NJ, wasn’t a real resident. Historically, other candidates have had to answer for similar multi-residency issues. I’ll also point out an interesting constitutional tidbit- you must live in the state you are representing at the time of your election. Not necessarily while running for senate election. So I’m not sure his TX homeownership disqualifies him, but this is a story I’m following.

On one hand, some Georgia GOP voters have said they like Walker because they know him from his football days, they think he’d be a fresh face in the Senate. People often like political outsiders who don't have conventional experience. But - there is indication that republicans in Georgia don’t want to see another seat go to dems and that is likely a significant part of his support base too.

Georgia voters keep showing they aren’t tired yet! The latest numbers from the first days of early voting over the weekend broke state records for turnout.

Great q. I do think there has been a proven purple trend in Georgia because we’ve seen it for a few cycles now and doesn’t appear like a fluke. A big part of the trend is that Georgia has experienced a population growth of younger and more diverse groups, due to metro areas like Atlanta being attractive places to live.

More diversity and youth in your pool of voters makes things more competitive during election time. Younger people are also less inclined to be party loyalists. I point out this trend in a recent story a few weeks ago.

This isn’t to say the purple will last forever in Georgia, but it is a phenomenoon has kept us on our toes over the last few years.

I think this might be a particular race where we don’t see the election denialism narrative as much. Walker has said he’d accept the results of the election and he doesn’t seem to be running on re-litigating 2020 like others have.

I think with many of the more vocal election deniers losing their races earlier this month, republicans might not want to make that a central theme in this runoff. But, of course, that narrative is still out there.

The likeliest outcome is Dems lose the senate, but a 50/50 split would not be out of the question and honestly more likely than maintaining a 51/49 majority given the map.

I don’t think there has been a single poll where Sinema gets more than 20% of the vote. Schumer and the DNC need to stop caring about that traitors feelings and back Gallego. There damn near no pick up opportunities in 2024 and a lot of opportunities to lose, I get that. But Sinema is clearly not popular in Arizona as she is receiving less of the vote than Kari Lake in hypothetical 3-way races.

It's not that people don't give a shit. It's that they don't believe there is a legitimate way to get rid of the criminal organization that has hijacked the sport globally. Boycotts don't work with the mafia.
in all honesty. if people would see the effect or their doings, like boycotting the world cup mayn more would do. many jsut dont do it because they always think their boycott would not change anything and thats why they jut dont do it. its the same with environmental pollution or just throwing some garbage onto the street. very shotsighted but thats how majority of people are.

Again, it's a transparency issue because we're used to seeing a President's tax return every year. The fact Trump never released them indicates he has something to hide, which wouldn't be surprising given the mountains of scandals surrounding the guy since 2016 and even before.

Don't really get it myself. My best guess is it tells exactly what he made when. Giving a very good idea of his actual net worth. He likes to pretend he's a brilliant businessman. Tax returns would summarily end or vindicated such a notion.

It sounds like the person you replied to was speaking generally, and not necessarily that the US has the highest standard of living. Regardless, just like there are quality of life differences between living in different parts of Europe, there are big differences between different US regions and states (many of which have economies and populations that rival whole EU nations). With regards to metrics, many US states rank high and compare favorably, but the overall rankings are often dragged down by certain states. My own experience as an immigrant to the US with family friends in various parts of EU, UK and Israel is that the US is still one of the best places to live, especially for immigrants.
I can't imagine how utterly delusional you have to be to say America has the highest standard of living in history. While yes, you can't compare the Taliban and the GOP, America sits in the mid-twenties in every ranking of Quality of Life, even ones made by Americans. Among western countries, america is one of the worst places to live.

The reality is, if he was on the ground and couldn’t call out for help for a while after falling who knows how far and his official Twitter is asking for prayers for the family, I don’t think his prognosis is going to be good. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone of course, but they are treating this like something incredibly serious. I guess we will see tomorrow.

Discussing politics, the ebb and flow of the house membership could have significant ramifications. If Steube is medically sidelined, Devolder/Santos ejected for an illegitimacy (certainly possible), and Virginia replaces McEachin in February, that's 220-213. For something like raising the debt ceiling without having to mint a trillion dollar coin, convincing 4 Republicans to buck their party might be doable.

Biden doesn't write legislation but he sure influences what goes on that floor and how people vote for it and don't you forget it.

On Tuesday night, Senator Bernie Sanders withdrew a measure to end U.S. support for the Yemen-Saudi Arabia conflict. President Biden stepped in, reportedly vowing to veto the measure if it passed. Two California senators declined to support it and although two Republicans publicly were in favor, Sanders withdrew the measure because "the votes weren't there" for a bare minimum 51-vote passage.

Never trust when someone gives you that lame line about Biden's inability to influence legislation or policy because it's absolute bunk.
No, they've been sending lost of their own fairly-limited equipment stocks to Ukraine, as well. Poland sent virtually all of their T-72 tanks at the start of the war, several NATO members have severely drained their stocks of SPGs to equip Ukraine, all kinda of tech, maintenance, intel support has been provided by virtually every western ally, and not even mentioning all the consumable materials sent by basically everyone, MREs, water, basic infantry equipment, plenty of small arms, probably almost every kind of missile launcher ever made in some quantity or another, and all that's just off the top of my head.
Attack, no, but an emboldened Russia with a significantly increased influence sphere, with Ukraine's population, heavy industry, farmland and heavy industry can do to fuck shit up for the rest of us here in the region in myriad ways. They don't have start launching missiles to terrorise its smaller neighbours, and given the history of our countries, the way Westerners poke fun of how Russia can't bake a cookie without it being somehow defective, guess what. Mismanagement and sabotage are devastating, too.

It's massively important that one of the liberal justice candidates wins, but it will still come down to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of independent state legislature theory it could allow the Republican majority state legislature in Wisconsin to not be able to be stopped by the Governor or state Supreme Court (if it is flipped to Liberal majority) and give them sole authority on drawing maps and potentially how elections are carried out (and electoral college is decided).

The GOP Senate Majority Leader in my State House got busted about two years ago driving drunk in the middle of the night the wrong way down an interstate at excessive speeds. He even tried to outrun the police. When he was finally pulled over he was extremely belligerent and verbally abused the arresting officer, but was released almost immediately on his own recognizance upon being taken into jail.
Ukraine stops about 80% of these or so so while they can keep doing it the payoff is small considering what they are losing in stopped missiles. It comes down to attrition, how mich can Russia resupply and how fast can Ukraine rebuild and how much material do they have.
These exist and are called mobile substations. They typically are used to take a substation out of service for maintenance. Getting 6 million people back on in 24 hours seems like transmission line repairs to me. It’s an insane amount of customers to get back on in that short of a timeframe.

Almost all of the times you are going to do scheduled maintenance on a substation you don't use the mobile substations. Those are reserved for emergencies. Usually you would simply reroute the power through connections and then disconnect the substations.

From experience i would guess that Ukraine probably got the majority of the people back on the grid by rerouting via connections, ehich id usually done quickly and with remotely operated devices. Then they probably had to patch up the holes in the grid in certain places to get the rest of the people back up.
Remember when the WHO determined that stress from fear of radiation caused more adverse health effects than radiation from the plant? Same thing here. It's fear of the scary word "radiation" that threatens the fishing industry.
I used to be a carer for a guy who worked in Libya does system stress testing stuff. His colleague was instructed to go into a reactor or something of the sort to do some tests. He had a geiger counter and it started reading really really high levels of radiation, indicating a radiation leak.

He was in an area which was supposed to be shielded so was not wearing radiation protection, so he evacuated the area. Extensive investigations took place and it was determined the geiger counter itself was faulty.

However, although the man was not exposed to any radiation, he lost his hair and developed a multitude of benign tumours around his body.

The plant is on the seashore. Dumping it inland would require an enormous amount of energy to pump it uphill, not to mention the pumps and system of pipes that would need to be installed. And it would just run downhill into the ocean, anyway.

2. When republicans say "cut taxes", they are talking about income taxes. You likely pay mostly payroll taxes, so you won't see much if anything in savings.
Poachers in the sanctuary are clearly heavily armed dangerous people. They do need to be dealt with as such. However, the problem of poaching is not going to resolve by killing them. It will reduce rhino deaths, but also escalates violence and puts even more people at risk, because ultimately the poachers aren't doing it because they want to kill rhinos or because they don't fear the consequences, they're doing it because it is extremely lucrative in a place where making that kind of money can be otherwise impossible. The problem of poaching will only be resolved by not making people so desperate that they feel like the risks of poaching (or the risk of joining gangs that will fund themselves with poaching, which is ultimately a similar problem) are worth the rewards.
I don't know the situation but from the same article, locals living near the park are getting caught in the effort. I would imagine not everyone is aware of the defined borders of the park and people may be getting shot for simply being in the wrong area.

And no that doesnt mean legislators should be given marked guns. They likely do not have the emergency training and, frankly, given that some are calling for a "national divorce" its not unimaginable that a member of congress could be an attacker/shooter.

It’s stealing military technology. That isn’t as simple as IP theft. I doubt the CCP would give such generous sentences for foreigners who were caught doing the same. It might make a terrible person for saying this but depending on how much information they took the sentence should match the severity. You might disagree and that’s okay but I believe stealing technology that literally threatens the national security of my country and our partners requires a much firmer hand.

Right wing fundementalists/the klan/Nazis can't even get along with each other long enough to accomplish something.

Italy has six of those, one is for training purposes, one has to go to Kuwait, one in Slovakia and two are backups during maintenance, there might be legitimate issues to resolve there; You could argue that the government is slowing down the process for internal political bullshit but how the hell do you see the involvement of organized crime in this, it just sounds unnecessarily racist.
It's an equipment that was never sent before by any other nation, nor previous italian gov. Current leading party is indeed very pro Ukraine and this is way they will send these high tech missiles. You just said something really stupid and simply false.

Ark gov is Huckabee Sanders. If you ever feel like you are underqualified at a particular job, just sit back and marvel that this lady has a paycheck bc she lied to the USA and looks like her dad.
You know with this discussion a part of me thought for a second that beyond the overt reasoning for his visit…. Because if we’ve learned anything about Russians and Ukrainians over the last few years it’s that these guys play a different level of chess… albeit some with awful criminal motives and others like zelensky with much more benevolence… but if I were him I’d have valued the opportunity to see who’s sitting and I’d have taken quite a bit of careful notice to the numbers and to the individuals themselves. I think he and his citizens are incredibly intelligent and will use a lot of things from this trip, it is in effect intelligence gathering on your ally. Who could fault him of course. Not that any diplomat or whatever visitor wouldn’t do the same, just that in this case especially and given trumps call to him a few years ago… that kind of observational OSINT carries a bit more weight. Above the money and the equipment even… he needs to get a first hand feel for who he’s working with here, all of them. It was the right thing to do on all levels. Risky but right.

Of them, 100 aircraft are from the U.S. military, including four B-52 bombers, four F-35 fighter jets, 45 F/A-18 Hornet fighters and two MQ-9 Reaper drones.

Russia didn’t exactly get “caught” with their pants down. They started a war that way. Seems like they fully planned to fight with their pants around their ankles.
Except we don't need a Republican Party, or even a second party. What we need is democracy, which is independent of the GOP. You can have a democracy while only having one dominant party, and you can have multiple parties but still not have a democracy. The problem here is one major party is actively working to destroy democracy.
I think it's been on the decline since Eisenhower, but there have been a few times when the rate of change changed significantly. Imagine looking at one of those wavy slides from a side-view.

I think it's been on the decline since Eisenhower, but there have been a few times when the rate of change changed significantly. Imagine looking at one of those wavy slides from a side-view. Some parts are flatter, and some are steeper, but it's all going downhill. Gingrich oversaw one of the steeper parts, but that's not the only steep part.

I lived in Vietnam for 6 years and was pretty good at only drinking in places that served real booze (avoid the tourist bars that offer insanely cheap drinks, basically), but I got unlucky one time at a foreigner-owned bar that had been sold some counterfeit liquor. My friend and I had four cocktails and were so drunk that neither of us could walk. Our wives were so fucking mad at us for getting as shitfaced as we had at 9:00 p.m. before we got in touch and realized what had happened. Scary shit because I think if we had stayed any longer we might have been in for a trip to the hospital. Right when I arrived in Vietnam there were three separate instances of foreigners dying from drinking counterfeit booze.

Also 'dig', which is the Irish for to understand or to get (thuig). The Irish were in the same socioeconomic strata as Black people in the US, and language swapped around.
Ages for this sort of shit are set as much out of practicality as anything. Realistically 13 year olds and 17 year olds will often end up in the same social groups and teenagers are gonna do whatever the fuck they want.
Now, realistically, the impact is going to be limited, given that IIRC most or all prefectures have this set at 16 or 18 anyway, with japanese (federal? is that how you'd phrase it) law previously only stating it couldn't be lower than what it set).

It's wild the only reason I know about the Romeo and Juliet clause is because of a Transformers movie where a guys stops the entire movie to do a detailed explanation to Mark Wahlberg.

So it's really a question of how many teens you wanna jail for being teens and how authoritarian you want to be about sex because this is by far not the only area we'd also be trying to limit down if we draw that line.

Also, while the 17 year old is more likely to be the more experience one who is the initiator of things, don't underestimate 13 year olds.

Also, also seriously stop a second and think about people lying about their age. 17 and 15 is fine. 17 and 13 is not. Could YOU reliably tell the difference? I don't think you could to a 95% degree of accuracy. It's not like you even have driver's licenses at those ages.
Why are you confident Trump would lose in the general election? He garnered the second most votes in history last time. With the Supreme Court's dismantling of the voting rights act, states like Georgia, that Biden won, could very easily wind up going for the Republican nominee just because of how many black would-be voters are unable to cast their ballots. And historically, the Presidential election has usually been a referendum on the state of the economy, if the economy is doing much below average or much above average; I certainly don't feel confident that the average American is going to think the economy is doing well in 21 months (heck, I'm not even sure if it's going to be debatable-- there is a non-trivial chance that the economy will be in a dark place by then).
I dont think they're afraid beyond they know if Trump isn't the republican nominee, he'll run as an independant and since they haven't been able to win the popular vote in a while without being at war, it'll guarantee their loss. Kind of like the house is at the whims of MGT l, Santos, and the ilk, they know their control is so tenuous they ended every last vote no matter how insane the voter is.

Came to mention this, you beat me. Money in elections is a major reason for the standstill. Taking money away from the recalcitrant might have the same power. It might also cause a stiffening of political opposition and a new victimhood claim. Still, ya use the tools you have.

I can see some holding that position, even if I disagree. The Mueller report was evicerated by a partisan DOJ, that effectively denigrated it in front of a right wing congress, that wouldn't convict a ham sandwich. Two impeachment proceedings that were actively ignored by sitting republicans. The jan6 committee forward its results to a new DOJ that has appointed a special prosecutor. At the outset that committe was by its own rules, to investigate irregulatities and make it less susceptical to quasi machinations like the fake electors scheme. Time will tell, democracy is messy, but still the best form of government that we have.

Holy shit, well done. So much for the red wave. Even if the GOP takes the House, they’re rudderless until 2024. I guess transphobia and election denial aren’t the best platform after all.

It's not new. My mom taught ESL to adult immigrants for decades and we had a couple waves of Afghan refugees who had never held a pencil, in the 90's. It's a pretty different situation to Iran, for example.
And ESL courses, whether in schools or in the community, are being cut and underfunded. There is a knee-jerk response to tell non-Americans (in the US) "learn English," while at the same time removing the resources that allowed them to do so. Math is a great example because it makes you scrutinize what you're asking of students: if they can't understand the problem, is it because you've turned the math question into a language comprehension question?

My math teacher even used to joke. "It's not a math problem, it's an English problem." We were all bilingual, although with varying degrees of proficiency at English.

Sadly many kids think ESL kids are dumb or something. I know in my school people were under that impression. It is quite the opposite and was very obvious with math, a subject that that isn't dependent on what language you speak.

A lot of Fox News’ revenue comes from the fact that it is bundled in most cable packages as “basic cable.” So if you subscribe to a cable service, you are bankrolling Fox News even if you don’t watch it. It’s fair to criticize Hulu on this one, since it’s a similar idea.

I grew up a JW (I feel like Mormons and JW's are cousins even tho they believe different shit completely lol) and had a conversation with a neighbor about her homeschooling her kids cause of some random book in the library that talked about sex. I told her I come from a conservative Christian family and she asked what church. I told her and she straight up said oh they are not christian they don't believe in Jesus. I was like uhhhh I am not one anymore but yeah they do they just believe he is the son if god not god himself. Sure they could be wrong but don't tell me what I spent every Sunday Tuesday Thursday and Saturday being taught. Everyone thinks they have the right beliefs and that's what makes America great. Freedom of religion and freedom of choice.....wait oops scratch that choice thing.

So a lot of conservatives are turning on these candidates, on Trump, on election denying, on Christian nationalism, extreme, anachronistic policies, but they voted for these candidates, for these ideas, they're only lashing out because they lost.

They'd undoubtedly support these things if their candidates did well, they're not coming around, they're just looking to pass blame for a little consolation, they don't really find these things unappealing, they're just upset that enough voters did.

They are going 110% in on desantis who has been all culture war since biden was elected. These are people who have actively called homosexuals sex predators and groomers in the recent months. Who’ve been banning books that encourage inclusivity even when it’s simple things like race.
The heart and soul of the school is (or was, maybe) the philosophy of not letting the institution get in the way of education - undergraduate only, narrative evaluation of every student's individual performance, a month every year dedicated to just independent research/art projects and a thesis your senior year. And the administration was incredibly accommodating - if you could prove an interest of even just half a dozen people, students could ask the faculty to cover tutorials or even hire guest professors to teach subjects not normally offered. And that's to say nothing of the culture of the students, which is incredibly diverse and open to new ideas.

The GOP majority was created with less than a total of 7,000 votes in the seats they flipped. They had record inflation to run on and an incumbent President with an approval rating barely at 40%. Even with all that, they STILL needed a GOP partisan gerrymand in Fl upheld in the courts and a Dem partisan gerrymand in NY thrown out by the courts to get their majority. If that is the best they can do, they are screwed in ‘24 when there is a presidential election happening.

Like I hated Schrader too, but the district was a highly competitive one, and even strong incumbents have been struggling in a lot of places. It wasn't an unreasonable decision to prioritize other races they thought they had a better chance in, especially when money doesn't translate directly into votes. It's not like we can say "If they'd spent X million, she WOULD have won" - all we can say is "Maybe she would have, maybe they'd have wasted a ton of money that did more good elsewhere.".

You say that now, but you're operating with 20/20 hindsight. It's entirely possible that the amount of money required to put her over the top is either near-infinite (meaning that no amount of money was going to sway enough voters, and any that it motivated it would also counter-motivate others), or that it would have been so much that it would mean losing 2-3+ other races that the money went to instead.

I can't imagine why, in a year that was expected to be really bad when Democrats were trying to defend a ton of seats, that they would decide not to fund what they saw as a risky challenger likely to lose.

The fact that McLeod-Skinner finished just a few points behind the Republican despite getting left for dead by the rest of the party pretty strongly suggests that decision was a mistake. Obviously there's no way to no for sure what would have happened, but it seems like if she had gotten a little bit of support from Democratic campaign organizations we could have gotten another seat in the house.

The bottom line is that progressive candidates just don't have a good track record of winning highly competitive districts, especially in challenging election cycles. And if progressives want to count on establishment support then the burden is kind of on them to prove they're good enough to win, especially when you're in the process of knocking off establishment incumbents.

And WA-03, my district, wound up being a good opportunity because the Republicans nominated a crazy person instead of their lonime incumbent. They dumped a bunch of outside support in, and he still lost.

So, no - ultimately it's on the candidate to run a good enough race and raise the money they need to win. It's great when outside help is available, but you cannot simply expect the establishment to come swoop in and carry you, especially when you're coming in as an anti-establishment challenger.
It should be obvious at this point. It's estimated that the Saudi Royals are worth over $1 Trillion. US politicians are completely bought out at this point, they bend over backwards for that dirty oil money.
I still don’t understand why the oil companies and military industrial complex allow them to exist. It’s not like they do anything for the world except sit on oil, and the USA has completely toppled governments for far less.

> That unease was not only due to the prince’s involvement in Khashoggi’s murder, the judge wrote, but also the timing of his appointment as prime minister of Saudi Arabia. Bin Salman, known as MBS, was only made prime minister – and therefore the technical head of the government – in late September in what observers saw as a ploy to secure head of government immunity in the lawsuit brought by Hatice Cengiz and Khashoggi’s advocacy group DAWN.

You got these ding nuts believing some vast pedophilia adrenochrome conspiracies, meanwhile the corporate boards are buying the politicians and using red meat wedge issues to fuck us all over. It's an obvious conspiracy its just that they openly bribe politicians while pretending they didn't just openly bribe that politician.

It's an obvious conspiracy its just that they openly bribe politicians while pretending they didn't just openly bribe that politician.

And for me it always comes back to money in politics. Capitalists have had the working people of this country by the throat back 150 years, with some brief shift in power in the early 1900s. We need another shift to get money out of politics for good, until then we will be on a cliff looking down at the decent into fascism.

The disinformation machine is hard to overcome. It should be obvious that if you care about humans and their well being, then who I vote for is obvious to me. republicans are fucking me and us over by giving tax cuts to the rich so the country is always broke. and were told this country is just too broke we cant possibly keep feeding the schoolchildren and we cant possibly keep social security and medicare and medicaid. Republicans are proposing to cut social security, some suggesting that they decide if they should renew it every year or every 5 years, which is not how you run a long term social safety program. And if old Republicans relying on social security or just about to need it because they didn't save enough for retirement STILL vote for those guys. I mean, either their just totally ignorant or they think it's a joke and are just really dense as to what those cuts would mean. It would mean a whole bunch of poor and middle class people don't get to retire. They will never have enough money to scrap by without a job, who's ok with that? I'm not.
When drugs can be used for profit due to scarcity and illegality, nobody is safe. There are 2 solutions, legalization and government production of all drugs which removes incentive for any cartel by killing profitability, or extreme and anonymous violence designed to eliminate them, and the option to implicate rival cartel against each other. But neither will happen, drugs are part of the justification for the police state, without drugs, the only reason for crime is the poverty capitalism creates by exploitation.
I always agreed with this.. legitimize the current drug dealers but I’m not so sure anymore. If weed is any indication of how “legalization” would work it may help a little but the government will overtax it, keeping the demand for black market around and still larger than the legit markets. Legal manufacturing and sales will have to compete with cartels paying no fiscal tax, offering a cheaper price. The government would have to lay low for a decade or so on taxation and charging millions to get a license.

They could just fund it entirely, like they do social programs, meanwhile attempt to get people independent from the drugs, destroy demand eventually if possible. There is a way to do this, I don't think it's wanted though. I believe the system is just how they like it.

I somewhat agree with some Legalization points, however the government isn’t going to be handing out kilos of cheap meth to everyone on the block. Similar to how pharmacy’s can’t give you too much of specific drugs. Cartels would still very much have a market in cheaper meth in larger quantities.
I don't disagree that CNN has a heavy lean often these days and I dislike biased media coverage, but that video is itself HILARIOUSLY biased and full of lean and misinformation. For starters, the viewership stat is completely cherry picked (the same day on the calender can have completely different levels of news depending on the year) CNN viewership has declined massively, but not by 90%. Nor are they at 50k\ viewers, they're at about 639k viewers during prime time hours (again, still massively down, but not to the level he's pretending). The worst part is the segment on Trump, he talks about Trump being anti big business and I just couldnt help but break out fucking laughing. Trump IS big business and one of his only actual notable policy changes while in charge was corporate tax cuts, seriously what sort of ridiculously biased video are you linking?
Just like how "literally" began to be used almost like 'figurately' and became accepted in the past 10-15 years, I unfortunately see the same outcome for 'slams'.

'slams" is such a childish use of words and I can't believe Reuters used it. It feels like something gossip news sites would use. Unfortunately, many or most reputable news agencies are also increasingly using it.

What an incredible silly take. Illhan had legitimate critique of Israel. Can’t be having that. But they are just fine with outlandish space laser conspiracies. No on takes the latter seriously.

I think the point was missed. I’m not taking a position of the technical feasibility of weaponized lasers. The point is, that racism is not the explanation for why Illhan, with her criticism of Israel, is shown the door whilst MTG is allowed to spread her claims about Jewish space lasers. The explanation is simply that the former is taken seriously whilst the latter is not. Those claiming it is based on racism are gaslighting and very likely serving the same masters as the republicans who showed Illhan the door. Note the author of the linked article is a member of the Israeli tribe.

PLUS University instructors, railway train crews, post office workers and many others. The UK is in a downward spiral, and their currency is falling fast. Those that can afford to are getting out, while they can. Applications from UK citizens who want to come to Canada have increased about 35 percent this year, over last year. JimB.

I wouldn't be surprised if some of the 35% comes from the federal skilled worker program only opening up part way through this year after being closed for 18 months or so. Speaking as someone who wanted to come to Canada last year, and only got there this year, the pandemic has effected such figures.

It's encouraging people to avoid Royal mail and use Amazon, Yodel, Everi etc. leading to their problems compounding and more lay offs.

Thank you! I tried to research what happened and found very little. The son of the last president reported that all board members were actively working to destroy the company, (probably a major crime) and all the president could do was keep a good shareholder payout.

What’s really dumb is those carbon industries could have got off their ass and started up the new energy systems, and would be getting even richer. Gulf Corp was working on this in the 1960s. They were the high tech company that found most of the oil throughout most of the 20th century using the gravity sensor.

I was wishing the research data was findable. They were breeding a bacteria to eat oil, maybe for oil spill reclamation and other things. I said at the time that solar electric seemed impractical, but the lead scientist said just give it time.
There's no better tonic to be found for making me joyous than watching Kevin McCarthy twist in the wind and be utterly humiliated by his own party. The man is truly vile and does not deserve anything. That the Democrats have actually banded together in solidarity and refuse to help end this GQP made mess is quite remarkable, given the past history of that party being weak at moments when it should've shown strenh. I already predict that this fiasco will be the foundation for the Democrats regaining the House in two years time.

I think the problem is language. the word "chicken" means chicken. The word grape can mean all kinds of things. grape flavor, grape the fruit, grape the juice etc. So if I see grape drink, it's a little deceptive but my brain at least is looking for the modifier. But chicken is chicken. Fried chicken, chicken strips, chicken broth, etc all have meat in them. "vegan chicken" is new and unfamiliar. You should check out this other sub where they were talking about how many people fundamentally don't know what the word "vegan" even means. One person thought Vegan=Organic. Another thought it meant "healthy" or sustainably raised, like people are legit calling eggs "vegan" because they came from a friend's chickens.
I can look at the ingredients when I purchase something at the store. At a restaurant I find it weird not knowing what my vegan “chicken” actually is. Putting the “vegan” in front of it only tells me what it isn't.

not sure what that has to do with this article. If the restaurant can't say vegan chicken then they will say "protein strips" or something. you still won't know what it is.
It is probably because they can exercise complete control over them. Something that you make dependent on you for their very survival is probably very appealing to them.

It's true. The clinical term is Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD/ASPD) which you can look up in the ICD 10 or the DSM V. There are no entries in either for psychopathy or sociopathy as they are not clinically distinct conditions.

The ones that define them differently pretty much all state their definitions, because there is no distinction widely enough accepted for them to know what readers will think otherwise. A couple of common ones are: psychopaths are born that way, but sociopaths are made that way by their environment; psychopaths don't know right from wrong, sociopaths know but don't care; sociopaths are like Sherlock from the BBC adaptation and psychopaths are like Moriarty.

Edit: I'm not providing links because you can look up the DSM and ICD easily using the information in the post, while the rest isn't something I have a single direct summary of - the best I can recommend is that you search "psychopathy vs sociopathy" and see how many different definitions you can find in the first few pages.

The answer seems to be that shredding White House documents isn't that easy. Docs are protected under the Presidential Records Act, and access to shredders is limited since they're for document destruction. Access to a fireplace isn't restricted, though.

Most financial advisors would say if you are that close to retirement that you are actually retiring, you should lessen your exposure to equities in favor of much safer investments. I am much further away from retirement but still had some of my 401k in bonds and what sucks about the last year is they shit the bed too. Cash was the only way not to get hosed.

I just don’t understand why a guy arrested for armed robbery 10 miles south of the city would drive up to China town to beat up an old Asian person on the street at random and not even steal anything. And I don’t understand why that happened lots of times. And I don’t understand why it was happening constantly right before the election and literally hasn’t happened since then.

But this wasn’t that. It wasn’t timed the same, and it wasn’t perpetrated by Trump type folks. It was overwhelmingly being committed, seemingly at random, by guys who had previously been arrested by the SFPD for violent crimes.
Prices are limited by what the market will pay, with considerations for cost of inputs and overhead. Income taxes are calculated after-the-fact based on net profits and have no bearing on how prices are determined.

I could see this happening in the long term, especially if the workers have a high level of bargaining power (e.g. in a union or a profession with barriers to entry). The only reason it seems like this doesn't happen today is that worker's rights have been seriously eroded in most parts of the U.S.

Is there actually a "thing that frustrates you about" logic which says that different people value things differently, or is that whole thing just a setup for your dime store Daily Show knockoff bit (which nails the tone almost precisely: it says absolutely nothing meaningful or in any way related to reality, but is very proud of itself for being sooo witty)?

I've been told multiple times that there needs to be a bipartisan coalition of at least 35 states to enact constitutional reform in regards to nationwide gun control including policing and that the most successful measures are carried out on a state or local level. Is that accurate? If it is, I think it provides some context as to why very little has been tried by the president. Or congress. There may not be as much they can practically do as compared to a more local level?

Can’t have it both ways. Republicans complained about lingering covid measures saying the pandemic is over but wanted to keep this while democrats kept saying title 42 was no longer necessary but insisted the pandemic was still going on.

It really is up to this administration and Mayorkus to figure out how to handled the large influx coming.

"Why it matters: After a lenhy litigation battle, Title 42 is set to expire next Wednesday after a federal judge ruled it unlawful. Fifteen GOP-led states, however, made a last-ditch bid to block its termination last month.".

This is a doubled edged sword. It ends the COVID era policies, for better or worse. Allowing more access to immigration hearings.

This is republican self-destruction in real time. They lost their business support over this and are too stupid to recognize they're digging their own grave in a desert of their own design.

Poetic Justice meets us at the border where Title 42 dies and this, too, is a poetic justice; which means karma is landing... let what fools must with death play stand on the tarmac. Heh.
Up until now China was fine closing everyone off from visiting China but now all of a sudden when other countries ask for precautions be taken (not fully ban mind you, just precautions) it’s not cool? Bunch of hypocrites.
Just writing something similar about the Chinese police in a Chinese message board would’ve taught you why your lame attempt at whataboutism is pathetic lol.

It’s kind of silly to require Chinese travelers to America to have a negative test, but have that be literally the only mitigation tactic they will experience in their entire stay.

I mean its the fat rich aunt coming back from her trip to China under the same quarantine guidelines? or does she gets to skip all of them because she is an US citizen?

You are aware that is what fucked us up in Jan-Feb 2020, not the extremely few Chinese citizens coming to the US for vacation/business during Chinese new years.

Forget people coming from China, cases in the Americas were mainly coming from Europe, since we shut people coming from Asia really quickly but didn't do nearly as well at stopping people from Europe, i wonder why...

You have to pass security and background checks to work in any government facility. Yet these "leaders" do not, they are on a honor system that has led too what we see running rampant in our leadership roles today, utter and pure corruption. How do we weed out the bad apples? Taking them at their word???? Surely you jest.

I called this one. Santos was our gift from heaven. His stupid ass went to far in the game and in doing so exposes many more taking advantage of the same rules and loop holes he exploited. That is what 3 now? I promise there will be many, many more if they continue to investigate sitting members.

The counterpoint the maga crowd has brought to me is that if I simply invest in the stock market, I'd have much more money than social security.

A big waste of time as far as anything significant happening like jail time, yes absolutely 100% agree.

Now as far as a waste of time outside of that? No not really. Even though nothing came of shit like the Benghazi hearings, they got a lot of right wing traction and I believe most right wingers still hold onto it and point to it as something of substance. It's not about actually getting something out of the hearings it's about pushing a narrative of the dems do this, so they can then turn around and do it themselves and their base eating it up. "well the other side is doing it(they're not), so why can't our side do it!".

That just furthers the point, thank you. Nothing came out of it like jail time. The email bullshit was just that. But it put it into the republican ether that well she did it, so trump or republicans can as well.

What cost her the election was a few things, comey coming out and doing that certainly didn't help. But russian interference, hacking the dem and rep e-mails but only releasing the dem ones... and can't forget voter disenfranchisement. All of that played a roll.
In this election season, John Gibbs and Ann Coulter are both doing speeches saying that women shouldn't have the right to vote. Abortion and using birth control are being taken away from women. Who's to say what's next. Banning women from working, from driving? From dressing in a way that might cause a man to rape them? (Shifting the blame to the woman). All are real possibilities now in the wonderful toxic USA that desperately wants the 1950s back.
My personal impression is that 99.9% of the people in Iran would like to exit the Middle Ages as soon as possible. The other 0.1 % is enriching themselves through government jobs.

Hadn’t encountered the “recalled vote” strategy for polling, but in a way it’s like they’re TRYING to eliminate democratic bias, which could be a good sign. I think I’m just desperate to know the polls are BS.

Twitter is still relevant to people like me because the communities we belong to (Art Twitter, Black Twitter, Gaming and FGC Twitter, Software Development Twitter, Photography Twitter, Electronics Hobbyist Twitter, Skateboard Twitter) are still active there and we're not going to just drop it overnight, and unfortunately, most of them will never migrate to Mastodon.
I almost feel like that moniker is used ironically in general now since those who complain about their free speech the most tend to have the most brittle glass houses while constantly itching for a rock fight.

It's very easy for people who didn't use Twitter to promote their business or was part of multiple communities that were very active on Twitter to say "They must love right wing tweets randomly showing up in their timeline even if they don’t follow them!". Either you're exaggerating or somehow I've gotten lucky because my Twitter feed hasn't had right-wing nonsense bleed into it it for about two years now.
As pointed out. People strike en mass because there are issues beyond pay rise. Please look up stories and more written by real employees.
Like people ask for more pay to survive, yet are asked what EXTRA work they do "for free" to justify the extra pay? (Whem already understaffed).

Often it just isn't. It's already been acknowledged that would have cost less than the money lost to strikes. That £200m lost by Royal Mail could have gone towards meeting a pay increase, and that amount doesn't include the loss of future business caused by RM customers finding alternative delivery services.

UK and more are promoting fedualist, aka thoes in charge do whatever they want and the "poor" need to stfu or there will be sever consequences. Aka like how people hate cheap quality brands, thoes "in charge" see the working class as such brand, even filth level.

I completely see where you are coming from in this. However, Putin's problem was that he wasn't going to have a legacy. Russia never prospered under Putin, and the glory days of the Soviet Republic was well in the past. The Ukraine war was his asinine attempt to secure a legacy.
Lol, every time we meet with China it's "high stakes". Nobody wants to extend the status quo more than China does--. I mean, it's worked out pretty damn well for them over the last 50 years. I simply do not believe they are going to upset the balance over Taiwan.

I'm here in tinajin, so like 100km from Beijing and honestly it's gone mad, everyone now has covid. Pretty mild symptoms but you can't even get a delivery driver for shopping. We went to 3 septate restaurants this evening and everone was closed because lack of staff.
crazy, in my country I haven't heard anything about covid for a year, it has completely disappeared from everyday life.

We have only just moved to China and it has been like living in a different world, we get asked alot by Chinese nationals about how many people are dying outside china and if it's true that we don't have any covid controls anymore.

Now Xi can claim to be the adult who tried to protect the protestors, but they didn't listen and got into trouble. Of course CCP is also saying no deaths at all.

It blows me away how insanely effective the vaccines have been in the US. Cases have stuck to 25/100,000 since March after the massive omicron spike. People are still occasionally getting it, but it's mild symptoms where they just stay home a few days.

We have only been here since August. We came, it shut down a little bit, no lock ins just mass city wide testing. The same test and go stuff and the qr code check in everywhere. But now, there is nothing, I have been and tested at the booths this Monday and Tuesday and I still don't have the results on the app which makes it completely useless, that being said you now don't need it to do anything. The school provided us with rapid lateral flow tests. My wife and I are triple vaccinated and have both had it before so we don't really care about it's spread 🤷🏼‍♂️.

If we're speaking about the Israeli government ignoring/disregarding a "two state solution", that's been going on since they were founded. They took a lot of land that the 1947 UN Resolution 181 had set aside for a "future" Palestinian state during the 1947-1948 Palestinian Civil War.

The Camp David Accords during the Carter administration achieved a peace with Egypt, but left the Palestinians still in limbo.

And before anyone goes "But the Arabs refused to sign the agreement", of course they did! There were no representatives from the Palestinians brought to the table. The Israeli's had people sitting at the table representing their interest. They had lobbyist groups fighting hard to push for the creation of Israel. And at the end, they got like 90% of what they wanted, where as the Palestinians got nothing other then being told they had to leave their land that in some cases their family had lived on for hundreds of years.

As for the Camp David Accords, peace with Egypt was inevitable. Egypt wrecked Israel in the 1973 Yom Kipper War, and as much as Israel likes to claim they were winning at the end, they were burning themselves thin. Their southern forces were practically wiped out, where as the Egyptians still had plenty of forces, albeit separated and fighting independently from one another, still making plenty of headway by the time a truce was called.

Because the Oslo Accords provided almost nothing in terms of concrete defensible borders of a Palestinian state. Israel gave a wink and a nod to the Palestinian National Authority then steamrolled - literally - through the West Bank and Gaza anyway.
The true counter to this has already been found. We already have this problem - in space. The distance traveled between the earth and Mars for example means that there is a considerable delay in when you send a signal and when it is recieved. If you send a stop command when it is about to hit an object, the delay means it might hit the object before the command is recieved. This problem already has multiple solutions that are tried and tested. They include: basic mapping software using on board sensors and auxiliary systems, pre-planned commands, check point based commands, semi decision making programs (as in rudimentary A.I. - think 1998 enemies in video games), and direct feedback based commands (you set a point or value and on board sensors update feedback commands on the device on what to do). That being said, these require more processing power, more electronics, and more weight.
Upon reflection, it is sad that so many images of the future are linked to war. "The Jetsons" was one of the few in popular culture that showed peaceful domestic life.

It really doesn't matter. Any party that is at the receiving end of this is not going to plan ahead with the published numbers in mind as they most likely are not even close to the real numbers.
The first point of the Chinese peace plan says that every countries sovereignty and borders must be respected but nowhere does it state that Russia must withdraw from Ukraine.
Obviously this leaves enough room for interpretation since Putin believes the occupied regions are Russian.

It would be great if China listens to the Ukrainian viewpoint but I doubt much will come of it. China is totally fine with Russia being cut of from the west as they can grow their influence and export.

You are aware that this is just Zelinski calling China's bluff right? Because if Ukraine dismissed it out of hand Russia and china go to the UN and scream "see He's not interested in peace!" By saying, yeah sure I'll meet Xi, and the outline Ukraines red lines in the context of Chinas plan then it forces Xi to either work those into it's currently very vague plan or show it's hand by not actually respecting Ukrainian territorial integrity.

Yeah, I think the last thing we have to worry about is Zelenskiy making a bad peace deal with China. He will hear them out (no harm in that) and then counter. Zelenskiy has been rock solid so far, I don’t see that suddenly changing.

Maybe the assassination of both Zelensky and Xi during the Ukraine/China peace summit by Russian militant extremists will be the Archduke Ferdinand moment of World War 3 or at least the Star Trek VI Undiscovered Country moment -- love to see Xi quoting Shakespeare.
Closing it would open a can of worms. Then everyone would do the same. Turkey wont allow anyone through to the black sea but turkey vessels. Japan would not allow anyone go in between their two biggest islands. Etc. Etc.

Edit also if China is harsher on Canada that means they are basically admitting that they are afraid of the US.

In Sweden you can look up anyone’s crime record and income with the click of a button, it’s good for checking out potential tinder dates (the crime record part, not the income) but it’s also kinda creepy that pretty much your entire life is public and you can’t block access to your info.
Yup, you can either contact our tax agency for free or pay a symbolic sum to one of the companies that provide this information, I think in some cases the person will be informed that you’ve made the request though.

That cant be true for the most common simple phone scams where its about getting a one time payment out of the victim. Actually it makes for a nice target list together with age.

Sweden's kind of big on transparency. You can also google where pretty much anyone lives and what their phone number is. If you google my name and surname you'll get the precise address I live at, what year I was born, when my birthday is etc. Eniro.se and many similar sites function as modern day phonebooks.

Just last week I found someone's ID at one of those 24/7 unmanned convenience stores. I looked the name up on Eniro to see where he lived so I could go put it in his mailbox.

Look at it from another viewpoint. Since Sweden has operated like this, security and identification protocols already account for this info being easily accessible. Therefore, this could actually lead to being more resilient to scams.

I’ve never heard of anyone using income as a criteria for dating, I’m not saying it doesn’t happen but it’s not really a thing for the people I know. Many of my friends tend to go for handymen though.

SF already banned all gun stores so contacting the SFPD with WE WANT MORE GUNS BANNED is just going to get shrugs. Sacramento might do something but there's not much to do besides imposing a psych eval, which won't do much except ban most immigrants from getting legal guns as they're disproportionately impacted and cannot obtain healthcare as easily. Nevermind the fact that the handgun in the Half Moon Bay shooting was from San Mateo Co, who won't ever ban such sales because they make so much taxable money from it.
look at it this way, as long as they spend their money on pointless Western and Asian luxury goods, all the money the world pays them for oil just flows right back.
If you're suggesting the bribed the ref, Saudi Arabia got 6 yellow cards during that match lmao. Ref was handing them out like candy to Saudi. The fact of the matter is, Argentina became over confident after half time and Saudi's very risky offside trap paid off. They simply put performed them in the 2nd half.

Now go back to watching your hand egg matches where half your players end up with brain injuries by 30. We'll stick to the real sport.

Typical American which knows nothing about football. Argentina is a contender to win the world cup. They have way more on the line to lose by losing the match than any bribe. This is also Messi's last worldcup and no amount of money would ever make him consider fixing the match since he already has more money than you could imagine. He wants to achieve a world cup victory with his country. So which is it, do you know nothing about football or are you just racist against Arabs.

A jib is the smaller front sail on a sailboat. The way it is cut is how it is angled, and you want that to match the mainsail most of the time. If you like how someone's jib is cut, you're saying you like the way they sail (more or less).

Hits the nail on the head. Plenty of people bitching about FIFA but they are also the same ones watching the games and keeping track of who is winning or loosing. Or if they have $$$, going to the games.
But I'm not the best explain all of the details behind it, instead here is a short but well researched educational video about it:

He is literally working overtime on getting rid of normal everyday millennials, from the start of war, more than 4 million people emigrated. If it continues anybody who has some brain cells left and knows English or some other foreign language will leave. Leaving Russia behind with millennials and gen 0, no workforce no country.
The biggest proponents of Putin's war are the older generation. The government is catering to its base of support and the younger generation are expected to pay to cater to the older generation's delusions of reclaiming Soviet greatness.

Settlements: With the Treaty, the agreements between Japan and Korea concerning the settlement of problems in regard to property and claims and economic cooperation was also signed. Japan provided South Korea with $300 million grant in economic aid and $200 million in loans together with $300 million in loans for private trust, a total of $800 million as "reparation fee" that Japan had to pay for their illegal occupation.\[8\] The official policy of Japanese governments has been that, in regard to war-time property issues and individual claims for compensation, such issues were settled completely and finally by this agreement. But Korean Supreme court decided that all the charges related to individuals still are alive.
It appears Korean government at the time failed to distribute funds to the individuals who qualified and simply spent it so the onus is on Korean government.

Japan thought this was settled in 1965, but Korean courts are supporting lawsuits against Japanese companies in Korea for compensation. Few if any wartime labor survivors will see any money. This will drag on for years to come.
You'd think that they would step back and take deep look at their party, but all they will do is toss their chips "all in" on the current path; they'll just leave Trump out to dry and continue what their doing. They'll continue looking for the "Hail Mary" that they can use to entrench themselves so deeply into power that it will take more than just a "Blue Wave" to wash them out; it'll take a "Blue Tsunami" to even win a house of Congress. The election system already requires the Democrats to receive 4%+ of the total votes in order to win the House, Senate, and White House. It's not going to get any better if the Republicans worm their way back into power in 2024.

OTOH, Nancy is way more pragmatic than me. Her conversations would probably include questions like "What's in it for me?" Then she'd put them all in a list, and pick the one that offers the most or asks the least.

Just because they are out doesn't mean they can't be elected speaker. You don't have to be a house member for that (which is why people keep floating Trump's name).

Still, I can easily picture Republicans bickering to the point where Democrats have to step up or nothing at all will get accomplished. We've got a country to run, after all.

Speaker is a powerful position, quite aside from being 3rd in line to the presidency. Giving that away to an 'outsider' isn't going to be a popular option among those who have sought (and achieved) power.

Plus the "5 or so moderates" might have candidates of their own in mind as the price for their apostasy, and Liz's name isn't going to be viewed favorably by their supporters back home.

And while Liz's name is viewed positively by many on the left outside of Washinon, I'm not sure how many friends she really has in the House. Getting 100% of Dems to vote for her may not be as easy as all that.

From a more pragmatic point of view: While Liz has shown that she's very anti-Trump and pro-democracy, she's a very hard-core conservative. So even if it could be made to work, why would the Dems want to do it? What would they get in return besides "not McCarthy?".

I do think that House Dems should be floating variations of this idea to their Republican fellows though. Who knows? They may hit upon a name that both sides can agree upon.

Besides, making people consider alternatives (and seek profit for themselves) will make McCarthy's life hell, a worthy goal all by itself. Heck, if the split is as close as I'm hoping, McCarthy is going to have to mortgage his soul for every bill for the next 2 years or nothing will ever get done.

PS While it's about as likely as Liz getting the position, it's not impossible that Pelosi could end up speaker again. That lady does know how to craft a deal and she knows where all the bodies are buried (having buried a number herself). And the benefits she could bring to the negotiations with "the 5" are not trivial:

Do they take photos way out in the ocean from satellites? I mean they could, but if it's not standard and they didn't have a reason to be doing so, there might not be any. But I have no idea, that's just a guess. I feel like if they had imagines of the culprit this would have gone way differently.

There has already been news that there are satellite pictures that show these vessels. A private firm came out saying they had some, and I’d say you can bet the spy satellites have them too then. No further news or any mention of it since then.

The investigation builds on earlier scrutiny of the privately run Georgia facility following allegations from a whistleblower who said a doctor contracted by the detention center had performed gynecological procedures on detainees without their consent. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas halted US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s use of the facility last year.

It's a legitimate argument that the GQP uses. Connecticut is one of four states that does not offer early voting, so this year it's on the ballot for the people to decide whether they want it or not. Republicans opposed it because they said it unfairly gives Democrats an advantage.

The nonstop Republican onslaught against voting isn’t about fighting fraud, it’s about making voting as inconvenient and inaccessible as possible. That’s all it is. They don’t have popular messages or ideas that resonate with the public, and in an increasingly polarized environment where more elections are won on the margins their game has shifted to throwing sand in the gears rather than reflecting on their unpopular platform or candidates.
Consider this, somebody has to build the shit in the gulf region, clearly the citizens aren’t going to do it because they are all rich as fuck. Yes the country is extremely unbearably hot, but what are they going to do to control that, it’s the climate of the area. The deaths reported are not all correlated to building the stadiums, they are the overall deaths of migrants in the country. It isn’t slavery, the people choose to go to Qatar and make a significant amount more than they would back home to send money to their families. The west closes borders to these people and doesn’t allow them to live there. The west also cannot act like everything we own and use on a regular basis was not created from extremely cheap labour in some of the very same countries that the migrants in the gulf are from. Qatar is also objectively better than most western countries in a lot of ways. It is immeasurably safer, extremely lower divorce rates, the streets are clean and the population is wealthy, on top of that they have zero taxes imposed on anyone making money in their country. It’s also hypocritical to say that Qatar has to respect our western liberal culture but we won’t respect their Islamic culture, which plays a big part in the prosperity of the country. The west really does not have moral superiority of Qatar, and once again that is ethnocentrism at its best, to judge a country based on our worldviews and not respect their own worldviews.

Pretty much how it is. If your neighbor lets his dog shit on your lawn, you don't blame everyone in the neighborhood for it happening. Not every Swede lit the Qur'an on fire, its just some right-wing jackass being a right-wing jackass.

Actually SD has specifically said that they were not involved in sponsoring him. The person that sponsored his permit this last time is a media-person that works for both SD and SVT (state owned media) and it is said he did this on his own accord where he also claims he was not aware of Paludan's plans when he did the sponsoring.

Furthermore, it would be better to say that Paludan has ties to AFS since he is/was a member of that party. Which is an even more extreme right wing party. They stopped supporting him when the allegations of pedo stuff came out.
Alright people, the report made by the FBI/DoE is of "low confidence." As someone who went to college for a degree in Intelligence Analysis, this is fancy talk for "We're taking a shot in the dark and we don't really believe this." Saying you assess something with low confidence is also something frowned upon in the intelligence community as it means you're not sure of what you're even trying to say is true.
Edits: The article claims that the FBI supports the theory that Covid originated from a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Viriology according to a linked article - it doesn't. The linked article is about a FORMER head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service/MI6 claiming such. Hell, despite claiming that this was leaked to the Wall Street Journal, it didn't even bother sourcing or linking the WSJ.

Most people don’t bother to know or understand this. They just read the headline and blame China. This article essentially means nothing. They’re just confirming that it’s all still just speculation.

Not defending republicans on this because when it comes to immigration there are competing camps in the party who have different goals and so it’s generally just easier for them to agree on keeping the status quo.

BUT, at the same time I have yet to see a deal put forward by dems or the gop that would actually be considered a fair compromise.

This “deal”, what? Trades amnesty in exchange for increased BP wages and a one year extension on title 42? This is hardly what I would call a compromise.

I hear you but from my POV the Republicans have moved the goalpost on immigration compromise so many times, it's really sucked the trust out of everyone. Just 3-4 years ago, it was funding for the wall that was paramount. We had a shutdown over it. A deal was supposedly struck in the WH which included wall funding. Then the deal was pulled by the WH.

Also, Democrats are more than willing to compromise. Who do you see having press conferences jumpstarting conversations and urging the need to work on immigration compromise? Sen Durbin has been trying to do something for 20+ yrs. On the opposite end you have the GOP threatening to jail the DHS chief, instantly pour cold water over a bipartisan framework (i.e. John Cornyn), shutting the door on anything bipartisan, saying "my way or the highway." These two are just not the same.

As far as walls go, its all nonsense. Its an expensive attempt to give the appearance of security when in reality it does little to stop the problem. It was one mans dream (guess who) that was never an issue until he started beating his nationalist drum and making scapegoats of people who do jobs that you and I would never consider doing.

Any sort of amnesty needs to actually fix the asylum backlog without just waving everyone through or loosening the requirements to qualify for asylum, there needs to be mandatory e-verify and massive penalties for businesses that don’t comply, and we need to move towards a points based system for allocating visas.

Don’t even get me started on the whiney-ass farmers and their republican allies who want more easily exploitable and cheap slav- i mean “temporary worker visas with easier to comply with regulations”.

Anyway, I don’t disagree that Republicans should actually try to make a real deal with Democrats on immigration, it just seems like Republicans have so many competing interests that are at odds with eachother, while Democrats aren’t willing to include anything that fixing problems with the asylum system that doesn’t include making it less restrictive.

Because more and more people keep entering the country every year this way and they’re for the most part, not the high-skilled and highly educated immigrants that a large consensus agrees we need to be attracting, most people either want immigration levels to stay the same or lower (and I don’t believe that when those polls inform people of what the numbers are that they even include people entering to apply for asylum), most studies have found that higher immigration leads to less support for welfare programs and I personally am in favor of more robust welfare schemes than we currently have, the way asylum works keeps people in limbo for years allowing them to set down roots when in the end the vast majority do not qualify for asylum. Credible fear screening is a very low bar to meet, but the bar for asylum is specific because it was not meant as a catch-all for people who do not qualify by other means, to migrate.

Like I could go on and on and ramble about this, but basically even when you read the comment sections on extremely liberal leaning media websites- there’s only a small fraction of people that think asylum is already too restrictive.

About your specific points that need to be implemented, almost all of them (e verify, border security, etc) were in the 2013 gang of 8 bill. GOP controlled house did not take it up at all. There is fear of going big bc of that "amnesty" word no matter how good the border security piece may be. So you see there is a history of GOP not being genuine.

An ICE unit that puts human dignity first - not riding around on their high horses (literally) driving people back into the Rio Grande. An ICE unit that doesnt rely on cages and family separation, something we have never done to our European cousins. An administration that recognizes the difference between immigrants and refugees.

I am not in favor of open borders, and I think overpopulation is a strong environmental concern. Its a complex issue that unfortunately I cannot solve. ICE and this Republican governor need to clean up their act.

If a former Republican can get 40% of the vote and a strong Democrat candidate lost by less than 1%, I think that's an obvious indicator he isn't as popular as people think. Even Republicans like Rand Paul won with a larger margin in their state in 2022.

Without Truml on his side, and I mean fully on board and campaigning for him, I don't think DeSantis pulls as many people as Trump. He's not even that popular in Florida tbh. He BARELY and I mean barely won in 2018 with a decent democrat candidate. (Won easily in 2022 because, well, it was goddamn Crist...) With all his fascist moves, I wouldn't be surprised if he's polling lower with key demographics across the state. I'm getting tired of hearing about him as if Floridians love him like they do Trump. They simply DONT.

Kinda. But Poland has been moving hard away from Germany for awhile now. Designed their own rifle (only ar18 derivative that can operate conventional and bullpup formats, it's interesting to say the least) and buying vast quantities of artillery such as HIMARS from the US (400 or so), so I really think Poland does not really care about getting on Germany naughty list like the rest of Europe. Whether that's a good idea or not is another debate, but their actions speak "we don't care about stepping on toes, we find other suppliers".
that is a very good point. hopefully they solved any diplomatic issues beforehand. there were rumors of this for like the last week or so. they just signed a agreement for abrams, afaik like 1200 and i think they just got a shipment of k2 tanks for korea. so, things are lining up for them to give ukr tanks.

Did you forget when Poland announced it would send migs to Ukraine, but then instead wanted to bring them to Rammstein, and then make the US bring them to Ukraine instead?

But there are so many spare parts for older models and Poland has been moving away from German tanks to American and south Korean models that they might not care if they lose support for their older models and are willing to risk it to get the ball moving twords europe supplying more heavy armor for their neighbor.
Water is a massive barrier to military operations. Neither Napoleon or Hitler could cross the twenty odd miles of the English Channel to Britain. Cost both of them. Russia has put some of their best troops on the right bank of the Dnieper with only two real bridges to supply them - the Ukrainians have targeted both of those with lots of artillery making them basically unusable. An army requires a massive amount of material - Russia can’t deliver enough so their troops are gradually being strangled. Their best option is to pull back to the left bank to improve their supply lines and also put the river between them and the AFU. Hitler made a similar mistake in WWII, he refused to retreat and tried to make a stand west of the Rhine - the Allies beat the snot out of the Wehrmacht. One of the great strategic blunders of all time. Putin has been fighting this war on political priorities and assumptions, retreating from Kherson is a sound military strategy, but politically very very unpalatable. That’s what part of the struggle has been the last couple of months, the Russian military has been hamstrung on several occasions by political priorities. Now, they’re colossally incompetent in multiple areas, but having a desk jockey trying to fight a war is a universally bad idea.
Man, Bosnia still had exploding land mines at least 16 years after the war. Rogue, callous disregard for innocents is poison. I hope clearing goes quickly.

Poland can activate article 5 of the NATO constitution and demand a response from NATO. If this is the case, I suspect at minimum, NATO will establish a no-fly zone. It's entirely up to Poland to activate article 5, though. And then I believe, NATO countries discuss and vote on a response.

Can’t wait to hear Trump’s hot take on this at his announcement tonight. “This never would have happened if I were president!” Yeah, because you would have helped Putin torpedo Ukraine long ago.

Hi RhubarbPi3. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
this proactive crossing the center straight line activity happens soooo many times regularly or even daily basis, I think the majority of Chinese and Taiwanese people are really immune to it, unless something much more severe happens like actions when Pelosi landed, compared to westurn audiences who are not exposed to these news much, who think this is a very big deal and war signal.
Or they could be fake-attacking Taiwan often enough that when the real attack comes Taiwan assumes it's another feint and doesn't respond in time.

There’s a huge difference between China sending a couple squadrons over the strait over actually building up enough assets to invade. The former is a nuisance while the latter will be spotted months in advanced.

A war would only make China's population problem worse. They already have an aging population that will be supported by almost half that population of workers.

If you start allowing the young to be killed and maimed that's even fewer workers to support retirees. The situation is unsustainable now. Short of sending retirees to go fight I don't see how a war helps their economic outlook.

If anything, that window is opening. This decade presents the most favorable naval conditions that China is likely to see in the near future because the US navy is decommissioning ships in the next few years without immediate replacements. At the same time China is rapidly expanding its own navy, scheduled to add another 60 naval ships by 2025 and an additional 40 on top of that by 2030. In that time period the US is retiring 7 of its 17 active Ticonderoga class cruisers and the replacement DDG(X) class is only slated to begin production in 2030, and the design hasn't even been finalized yet. The new Constellation class frigates are going to begin trickling into the navy starting 2026. China just launched their 3rd aircraft carrier this year and is supposed to complete their 4th late this decade, and most importantly for an invasion of Taiwan they are completing a number of amphibious transport vessels to enable them to actually carry over the troops they would need.

I didn't say China was going to outnumber the US navy, I said it's building it's navy during a time period where the US navy is going to be shrinking for awhile. So it's still the best time window China is likely to see for awhile whether you want to compare them by numbers, tonnage, spending, VLS cells, or any other metric you'd like to use. And the ships they're building aren't just a bunch of weak trash. The Type 055, 052D, and 054A are respectable combatants.

…no. No they’re not going to field a 6th gen bomber and 12 nuclear super carriers by 2030. To assume they can even get halfway there in 8 years is absurd.

And it's the same argument Chamberlain made about Hitler. Just let Germany have the Rhineland, it isn't worth a war over. Just let Germany have Austria, it isn't worth a war. Just let them have the Sudetenland...

When an aggressive country discovers they can extort things from the world by threats, they tend to demand more through threats, not less. After all if it's working then why stop?
Regarding Pearl Harbor, I'm personally a fan of how Bill Wurtz puts it in History of Japan. "Japan spits on the US and declares war, the United States accepts \[....\], but they're curious to see how it works, so they drop it on Japan \boooom\ they actually drop 2 \boooom\.....\[respectful/horrific silence\]..... \white flag\". I think that any nation should reserve the right to honor the good in their past, and mourn the unprovoked or nation-protecting fallen. But definitely holy fuck do the Japanese have way more right to mourn the outcome of the nukes than the US has the right to mourn the mostly unprovoked Pearl Harbor attack's casualties. Really is comparing a molehill (albeit \less\ provoked) to a mountain (that was redundant and unnecessary). Both were unnecessary. I think it's fair for both to be mourned. I think history is something that we should learn from, and respect it as a teacher and as the origin of what we can be thankful for in our current lives, but that we need to move on from it.

The greatest conservative minds recognized this as a political problem, so they huddled together and created political theater accusing the left of leaking the decision. They hoped that Americans would be more outraged at that than taking away women’s health care. The problem with their logic is that women’s health is a very real problem to millions of Americans whereas a leaky SCOTUS office is only important to DC politicians and political junkies.

Discovered it was likely Alito again, like every non-insane person who was paying attention said when it happened. Alison or someone on his staff leaked it to keep Roberts from peeling off Kavenaugh for a compromise ruling.

I feel like most people didn’t care about the leaker when it first came out because the ruling has such a rippling impact on society. But because the GOP made a big deal about it and then seemingly stopped talking about, , the public has a right know what happened.

It depends on whether the werewolf in question has embraced their curse or not. If they've embraced it, they'll turn out because they understand that the evil and chaos caused by Walker's election will far outdo any chaos they can do themselves. If they've resisted their curse, they will be out causing the classic werewolf chaos.

Isn't this the same bs polling they were trying to sell us before the midterms, if I was conspiratorial I'd suggest it was intentional to demoralize democratic voters.

The EPA has released a draft of its annual inventory, which found that US greenhouse gas emissions rose 5.5 percent in 2021 from the previous year, an all-time year-over-year spike, though they were still below 2019 levels. The report found that the increase was largely driven by increased auto emissions as driving rebounded in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fossil fuel combustion-related emissions increased 7 percent relative to the year before, while emissions from coal consumption rose 14.6 percent. In 2021, methane emissions comprised 11.5 percent of emissions, and have declined 16.3 percent since 1990. Electric power demand also increased 2.1 percent from 2020 to 2021, for an overall emissions increase of 7.1 percent.
They adopted colour quotas for the staff of the power stations and other grid staff, fired many of the experienced staff solely because they were white, and are now struggling to maintain the grid.
Power stations which are (well, were) perfectly capable of operating are not actually generating power now because they were not maintained and are now broken most of the time.

That's coupled with laws which basically grant a countrywide monopoly to one company and massively disincentivise or ban all other forms of power generation, including private.

Completely true, white are basically disenfranchised by the government in SA. They mostly work for private companies as state ones don't employ many. It's shocking we don't face sanctions really for blatant racism.

It won't ever happen. What's happening currently is a mass exodus of educated individuals who pay most of the taxes, to the point where our tax base is shrinking. Yes you heard me right, not just income taxes either. Our entire budget is decreasing, in a country with rapid population growth mind you.
I find it interesting that very rural areas are exempt from the prohibition. Possibly a way to encourage rural growth or exempt some areas of cottage countries across Canada. It will complicate lawyers' lives to have to figure out which census category a property is in, though (in some cases anyways).
Are they gonna prevent intermediary canadian companies from buying the homes FOR foreigners? Because if the 6% foreign ownership statistic in the article is true, this won't change jack shit.

Yes, the law does block direct or indirect ownership of residential property owned by Non-Canadians either personally, through corporations, or through other types of agreements. Seems like they've thought that part out and tried to close any potential loophole that could exist by using a corporation.

The law itself is fairly short, only 7 sections, and the regulation isn't that long either. You can easily find the text for the Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act using google.
They aren't very clear on how far this goes. Its illegal to smoke on beaches and parks here in Canada, at least in the city where I live, Ottawa. There is no law against smoking on the sidewalk, but you can't smoke within 9 metres of a bus stop or a bunch of other publicly owned facilities. You can't smoke on outdoor restaurant patios.
The article really doesn't give much detail on how it will be enforced and exactly what the restrictions are.

I remember making a rollie after a gig my first trip to Germany (from Ireland) and a woman very pointedly tells me I can't smoke inside which I thought went without saying, I was just making it.
It doesn’t make sense for china to outlay so much capital and manufacturing knowledge to a neighbor that has the potential to be a peer down the line in decades time. I don’t see them making the same mistake the Americans did. From India’s point of view it doesn’t make sense to let a greater power, especially a neighbor grow its influence in its country via capital and relationships if they intend to compete with that country for similar goals. India is completely fine with other foreign nations doing it because the foreigners have made it quite clear they are willing to play ball with India in attempt to prevent any alliance or severe dependency between India and China. If india can get just as much capital from foreigners and looser terms because the foreigners have realized they need India as an ally or at-least to remain neutral, why take huge capital outlays from a competitor that lives next door?

Geologists said that pressure builds up in the fault lines and needs to be released every so often. This particular fault line hasn't released its pressure in a while.
I took a geology class and what they said is fairly accurate to what I was taught. Basically pressure builds over time if it isn't released you get bigger earthquakes. Earthquakes shift the pressure elsewhere in the fault causing potentially more earthquakes. There is a bit more to how it works going into plate tectonics but that is the simple version.

They seem relatively soft in magnitude in that fault (seems they happen often enough not a huge amount of energy accumulates) and building codes are followed there, so buildings can withstand that much without issues, not much to worry about tbh.

Just open the door of the apartment (only if you can safely) if you are on the upper floors when it happens because the movement will screw with the door frame and can leave you unable to leave the apartment. That said, considering the historical record I don't think an earthquake there can create that much movement to deform the frames unless you get one that breaks the pattern.

I was in an 8 story complex in 2010, in Chile, and most neighbors in the last 2 floors could not open their front doors at all after the event.
The goal of tax code reform is to make what people are actually paying in tax, to be what we collectively expect them to be paying. Not allow any more of this nonsense tax jargon "well I carried forward losses on a depreciated international investment quantitatively offset by a high rate loan counted as a second residence through an LLC with 3 other principal ownership parties... so while I made 100 million last year, I actually lost money when you look at my balance sheet. See, no taxes needed! What are all those losses from? Well you see 15 years ago the government passed a 1 year temporary tax break and that year I made billions, according to my balance sheet.".

This isn’t even all about hurting Russia. Drone swarm attacks are looking like the future, and the US is sure as hell going to be facing these type of attacks in future battlefields. More so now that Russia and Iran are out to get us for what we have done to them. They’ll be selling them to our enemies worldwide if they can. We need to be sure our anti-drone weaponry can counter them. There’s no turning back now.
We tried not helping in South Ossetia and Crimea and all it got us was the larger Ukraine invasion. A few billion dollars to embarrass and defang Russia like this is actually a good deal geopolitically.

Yeah, we've been gifted the gutting of the Russian military for pennies on the dollar. We're getting to test logistical and weapons systems as well as tactics in drone warfare. At least for drones, we're also building the muscle for doing extremely rapid weapons development and procurement outside the normally stultifying pentagon processes. It's like a war game to prep us for an eventual conflict with China.
Surprisingly, less of an issue than you might suspect. If you are willing to accept a longer commute, you can just stay outside of Tokyo and work there using the shinkansen (high speed train). They may not be quite as everywhere as, say, Swiss trains, but they are a fine train system.
Heck, I could see some families to other locations on the network for this if they can find a place in the new city that is closer to a station even if they still work in Tokyo.

Well with two kids that could mean $15k additional income per year that’s $1.2k/month. Nothing to sniff at. With remote working added this could mean a better lifestyle (not that there’s any with two kids!) and bring back a much needed younger age group in some remote areas too.

I just hope that as we get better data we can converge a little more on what works and what doesn't rather than retreating to pure ideological or identity based reasoning. Reality is complicated and messy. Simple, elegant solutions never work no matter how much I, personally, wish that we could fix everything by simply converting to a Negative Income Tax and roll capital gains into this new income tax while putting in place a nationwide Land Value Tax to further punish absentee landowners. I recognize that such a plan would solve one set of problems while creating a completely separate set.
It's clear in hindsight that Reagan's policies were poorly designed. There just wasn't enough reliable data to call it in advance. A lot of people did call it, but there just wasn't enough real data to say for certain. I think that something like what Reagan did would have been a good idea given the problems face at the time, but not specifically what he did.

A couple in Florida showed up at Bank of America with deputies and a moving van to seize the bank's property when their phone calls and letters were ignored. I hope Australians can do something similar.
We could be, but the chance we will is now tiny. It’s important that people understand how important climate change is and that we still need to do a whole lot more to make things better. That being said it’s also important that people realize that the changes we’ve made so far and the progress seem to point to things getting better. If people think that we’ve accomplished nothing despite huge strives being made in almost every category to curbing climate change than they might think it’s better to give up. Emphasize the importance but you have to show people that there is hope.

I’m not denying that he or Republicans still have a chance in 2024, but the deck is stacked against them. Voters need to show up, but the math does not favor them right now. Still a lot of time between now and the general, don’t get me wrong. But I think we need to at least stop the “DeSantis is gonna wipe the floor with Democrats” bullshit, because it’s straight up bullshit. Republicans were supposed to obliterate Democrats in the 2022 midterms, and look where we’re at now.

Most of the cost was building a new city, airport, hospitals, etc... which are long-term investments. The stadiums themselves make up only very tiny portion of the reported 200B budget. Also, most of the money is just being redistributed between various royals Quatari royals who own all the companies being paid, its not like they paid 200B to outsiders or to the workers who built everything. Sure, the foreign engineers made bank, but the vast majority of the budget is just redistribution of wealth between branches of the royal family.

EU has literally zero jurisdiction when it comes to price controls in Croatia, there's no EU "economic ministry" either. There's ECB (european central bank), but neither them nor Croatian central bank can really do anything about shops gouging their customers. Both institutions done their job when it comes to the "big picture" of switching currencies, like agreeing on exchange rate, making sure there's enough physical cash in circulation, preparing banks for the switch, making sure prices are displayed in dual currencies (HRK and Euro in this case) etc...
It's slightly a relief but still more frustrating to know it was such a widespread phenomenon, I remember it didn't pass over me despite being a kid because it impacted videogame prices too: from sixty thousands of our previous currency to 60€ (basically doubled), having learned by heart the exchange rate of the two since it was often on TV I couldn't help but thinking those game store owners were either very lacking math-wise or very greedy.
The real sadistic thing about this bill is that because the Democrats still have the Senate and President, and the GOP have the House, neither will get anything done.

That's not how rights work. I don't give a shit about arms but no rights work that way. There was a whole important body of law, for example, about what restrictions were allowed on abortions and access when abortions were a right. That body of law grew absurdly inflated because anti abortion states tried every fucking imaginable thing they could to restrict access to abortions. By your interpretation of rights, abortions and almost any other right could be undermined easily. E.g. puting the only voting station in a state in one town that is extremely red or blue.

Mediation is indeed, "a preliminary tool to avoid prolonged and unnecessary litigation." Mediation is simply a formalized negotiation process that's guided by a neutral mediator, typically an attorney who's acceptable to both parties. The mediator encourages but cannot compel agreement, and has no authority to make any judgment. If the contending parties can agree during mediation, costly litigation or arbitration are avoided.

In almost all instances, the findings of the arbitrator(s) are "final and binding", i.e., non-appealable. You cannot ask a court to modify or reverse an arbitration finding; the court wouldn't hear the case. The only action most courts will take re: an arbitration finding is to enforce it if a party is failing or refusing to adhere.

I don't know what you mean by calling arbitration an "aberration". Most employment contracts and many commercial contracts stipulate arbitration as the mechanism for resolving a dispute. A common practice is not aberrant in the usual sense of that word.

The fact that it's common practice is not exactly an excuse for such an absurdly unethical practice. I understand that this is a hyperbolic comparison, but would you have argued that slavery was "not aberrant" because it was common practice in earlier centuries?

Aberrant does not mean unethical, it means departing from a recognized standard. Until 1865, slavery was a recognized standard supported by the Constitution and multiple laws.

Whether a standard is ethical or unethical is a different question entirely. Slavery was simultaneously both unethical and commonplace (ie, NOT aberrant).

If you meant to say, "arbitration is unethical", you should have written that. Words matter, particularly in written communications.
Samsung still has official stores open. LG is not just present in Russia, but actually creates new products exclusively for the Russian market. Apple devices are available to buy from authorized (actually authorized, Apple website links to them) resellers. EGS is the only non-russian game store that accepts Russian payment methods (including MIR cards I think). Twitch accepts money from russian payment services. You can buy Nvidia and AMD GPUs from partners because they still officially work in Russia. Not sure how official CPU shipments are, but all of them are available for MSRP (or close to it). For that matter, pretty much everything is available.
Yep. Feel like the only way someone would think Dutch people actually like Heineken is if they'd only ever been to the red light district in Amsterdam. You guys have some fucking magnificent beer. Last time I was there I remember wandering through the Jordaan for hours and finding some epic little bars that had beer I'd never heard of that was amazing.

I got locked out of my account for some reason, then they asked for my state ID as verification which was weird cause I didn’t have any real information on there. Anyway that’s the story about how I stopped using Facebook it’s been about 8yrs and I don’t miss it.

Hell of a lot of money has been invested in Truth Social, and all they have going for them is Trump.
Living in one of the redder states, this is depressingly accurate. I've probably spoken to and gotten responses from most Democrat legislators, they're not on board with this. I see them raise objections, concerns, speak eloquently, write op-eds, and just generally empathize.

When I worked at Walmart, we were told by management that we couldn't go to a big, annual Christmas party a vendor was hosting due to conflict of interest. Nice to know that sales associates making $9 an hour are held to higher ethical standards than Supreme Court justices.

China also has Pakistan. India is extremely close to Russia at the moment. Qatar is with Iran. South Africa seems to side with Russia. If Pakistan and India can endure each other, we are talking about countries with 3.4 billion+ in population are potentially in this modern axis. And that is not including the possible support from Central Asian countries that have been improving their ties with China in the recent years. Or the African countries that Russia and China has sunk their teeth into.

ITS TWITTER WHY DO PEOPLE CARE SO MUCH. FUCK TWITTER, YOU CAN LITERALLY POST ANYTHING YOU WANT AND THE FACT STANDS IT LITERALLY MEANS NOTHING. I really don’t know why people are sooooooo obsessed with twitter. I could literally post about the shit I took this morning. Why do people follow this shit like the gospel. People literally sleep, eat, and live for the shit that’s on twitter when it absolutely means nothing. Here’s a proposal… everyone who sees this should delete their twitter and never use it again. I’m sure the impact on your life would be very minimal. Hell you might even save yourself a headache each day. Like really guys who the fuck cares. These crazy mfs will get their word out one way or another. Why’s it gotta revolve around some dumb ass social media platform.

Textbook vexatious litigant, using the legal system to harass and gain attention from the victim and/or society at large. They don’t care if the suit is hopeless (they most likely know it is, if they aren’t completely bonkers), they just want to put their victim through the wringer having to respond to them.
Unfortunately, in most places I know about, it is a long and expensive journey for the victim to get free of this, despite the best efforts of the court system to deal with it. In Ontario, there is a rule that allows for reasonably summary dismissal of actions on the basis that they are “on their face” frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process; also, one could being a motion to declare a certain person a “vexatious litigant” - meaning they would require leave of the court to file further proceedings. Both orders would seem appropriate here, assuming Singapore has similar laws. Unfortunately, while this is as easy as the courts can make it, there are still procedures that must be gone through, excruciating for the victim as that is.

Look at Iran today. Rioting in the streets, currency tanking, officials transferring wealth out of the country and standing on the verge of regime change,... The punishment may be closer than we think. At least we can hope this is the case.

I want to believe it can happen here. Iran once knew a far gentler reality, unlike some of those other dictatorial nations, and I want to believe there is a buried-but-living memory of those times.

Yeah, the modern dictatorships are too savvy now and too technologically adept. The new era of techno fascism is scariest shit. Monitoring tracking surveillance plus slick high level propaganda and control of the media will allow a near inescapable iron grip. We're heading for that inflection point China's probably already there.
Hope people are okay. Turkey, Syria, Japan, now Papua New Guinea. Hearing about all of these earthquakes is quite worrisome being here in Vancouver and waiting for the big one..
Edit-and of course fuckall in this state is actually built to withstand earthquakes like they do out in Cali or something.

It wasn't the worst. By magnitude, the top 8 are all up in Alaska. Two of those, plus two more in California that were close in magnitude, had higher death tolls than the New Madrid ones. That said, another Missouri EQ of similar strenh could absolutely become the deadliest if it hit the right place - and regardless of fatalities the devastation would be tremendous. Scary shit considering you guys are nowhere near a fault line!

For those unfamiliar with Russian, "mir" means peace and Earth and was the name of their long orbiting space-station. Reagan proposed we name ours "freedom" in response, but what eventually got made with partnerships was the ISS "International Space Station".

I think his point is that reducing the complexity of a war to “good guys” versus “bad guys” is a dramatic oversimplification of the facts. You can support whoever you support, but it is never as simple as “good guys” versus “bad guys.” Indeed, your conception of it as such is largely a product of confirmation bias and the type of media you are consuming.

But what does “good” mean in this context, other than “the ones we feel we should be supporting.” There is some argument for the fact that NATO encroachment is threatening to countries that have been explicitly rejected from NATO. If the CSTO is was powerful enough to threatening to US, and Mexico was poised to join the CSTO, would the US consider that a threat? Certainly.
Only if Putin is okay with being embarrassed, taking the loss and deciding that he wants to stop sending innocent men to die in an unwinnable war.

I'm by no means an expert, but those things are a really bad sign and if they keep going through resources at the rate they have been, I wouldnt be surprised if they run out of steam. Maybe not this year, but Russia has shown they can't be underestimated.

Thats definitely a black spot on his record but that was more than a decade ago, he paid his debt to society and people change. He consistently assists with hurricane, and regularly helps out charities, his past may not be so great but he has proven that he's changed and is doing a lot of good for the world now.

He did the republican mistake, using fascist genocidal narratives and now unless he delivers he'll lose their support. The only ones who like putin are the indoctrinates russian \[maga-like\] folk and ultra-nationalists. They won't accept defeat. They're the ones asking why they're not nuking Warsaw.
Except it wasn't? Either you don't know what parties made the coalition or you just don't know that Meretz and Ha'avoda are left/far left and Ra'am are Arabs. That means the last coalition definitely wasn't a centrist coalition.
Ra'am supports the creation of a Palestinian state, which its capital will be Jerusalem, via ending the "occupation" and evicting all Jewish people from Judea and Samaria. It's also supports the release of all Palestinian prisoners, and the right of return to all Palestinians.

The division of votes in the last election was between far-right and centre-right parties. The left vote was not of serious consequence, and it hasn't been for years now. Lapid might have had a better chance of staying in government if Labor and Meretz had tied up together, but they will next time, I'm sure. Everyone, doubtless, is preparing for another election already, so we'll see what happens.

Next cycle hopefully we can crush the anti-wokeness bullshit and force the Republicans back into a state of being a legitimate party with an actual policy based platform, something they haven't been for over 40 years now. I'm fine with an opposition party existing that I disagree with. I'm not fine with an opposition party that I find contemptuously reprehensible.

It was a risk, but the payoff now is that most are going to dial back the crazy rhetoric a lot. None of these fucksticks believed their bullshit, they were spouting it to try and get votes and it failed. The ones who lost are going to keep it up, but they'll mostly be out of the limelight over the next two or three months. The rest will still be trying to doom and gloom to drum up their base (which honestly, both sides pull that on their base, but Republicans doom and gloom over fictitious scenarios) but it will shift from stolen elections and qanon crazy to DeSantis' anti wokeness message. Not that that is much better, but one thing at a time.

Many people seem to think that the 'fiscal conservative' line has more to it than just a line. Pointing out how that's simply not the case would do more to sway people than trying to tell the jesus crowd that jesus wasn't real.

Hell yeah, the guy who changed the law in 1994 to assist the cops in murdering, incarcerating and bludgeoning black people for the next 30 years and counting, has some very inspiring thoughts on MLK Day.

I mean, the rest of what Republicans talk about isn't even relevant, in a country that wants to call itself the land of the free. They're so loony they aren't even part of the conversation.

This was the year that I finally realized that Fox News doesn’t necessarily lie about these things, they just don’t report on them at all anymore. I grew up in a house that watched that channel for news, but back then they still at least showed most things. Now they’ve figured out that their devoted “all other news is fake news” viewers won’t ever know if they just ignore major news if it’s problematic to them (literally most of Trump’s presidency) because it’s not like their viewers are going to find out/believe it if it didn’t come from Fox.

Let me be clear, my dislike of Ben Shapiro has nothing to do with him being Jewish. He is a horrible human being and that has nothing to do with him being Jewish. He claims to know more about Jewish tradition than actual Jewish leaders and scholars. Hence my jab at him, now run along little boy you're bothering me.

Ben Shapiro must be pissed he wasn't asked, he claims to have a complete understanding of the Jewish faith when he tells actual religious leaders they are wrong.

if nuclear weapon is used by Putin would leave russia truly isolated. None of its allies, save North Korea would support them. Its really hard to emphasize how much of a misstep it would be for russia to do this. Putin maybe a cold hearted butcher, but I don’t think he’s that stupid.
Russia is pretty much isolated right now. Given how powerful nukes are the argument is very, very weak. Unless there will be a better one we're heading straight into the nuclear war.

Russia is not isolated from african countries, most south american countries, iran, syria, india, and china. Yes its isolated from most of the developed world, but even then not all of them. India and china alone make like a quarter of the world’s population.

Both China and India are unhappy with how things are going and both made sure that Russian authorities know it. Both have provided exactly zero military help (or any help of significance) despite extensive military cooperation history. Africa & South America don't matter much because the ties between them and Russia are pretty weak. What will change exactly?

Which way does the wind blow from Ukraine? Like literally would the wind blow the fallout over China? They might have a pragmatic reason for the weapons to not be used.
Semiautomatic firearms are limited to a capacity of 5 rounds, whether their magazine is removable or not. 30 round semiautomatic magazines are prohibited devices.
And the fact they added those as amendments AFTER committee testimony, where none of the expert witnesses had a chance to talk about the ban on all semi auto center fired rifles with detachable magazines because that wasn't the purpose of bill c21.

Anyone who has shot both will tell you a rifle is the far easier weapon to shoot accurately, and if your purpose is defense, why is having more rounds an issue? Without and even with practice, it is easy to miss. Not to mention it is easier to mount further accessories that benefit the shooter like an optic to quickly aim and a flashlight if you are in a low light condition.

A pistol is most certainly not. It is the best thing to be carried because it is small, but it is less accurate, so you are more prone to miss and send bullets to your neighbors, and also harder to shoot, so you are more likely to send bullets to your neighbors.

The difference is that the Reagan’s of yore at least paid lip service to respecting elections, marginalized groups, and doing the right thing. This made the difference between politics being civil disagreements and it being civil war.

They never had a conscience to begin with. At least in the past, they worked to maintain the pretense of morality. This at least kept their more radical followers from trying to say … overthrow the government, openly attempt to rig elections, or shoot up a gay nightclub.

The scary thing about today’s GOP is they have completely abandoned the pretense of a conscience. They’ve basically declared war on LGTBQ people, women, minorities, immigrants, Democrats or anyone who doesn’t agree with their Christian authoritarianism.
Once they have the enriched uranium it is surprisingly easy to make a nuclear bomb. The hard part is the enrichment. They don’t need blueprints- it is pretty straightforward once they have the materials.
Its a combination of materials and secrets. Nuclear technology is very much at the top of the “tech tree”—you need to be able to source basically everything from inside your own country. Gas centrifuges used to enrich the uranium require very careful engineering or they will shake themselves apart. They also spin very very fast so they make them from a high tensile strenh steel called marraging steel. If you can’t make or acquire this steel then you don’t have centrifuges. This is just one example out of a million in the line from raw uranium to weapons grade.

\ At present, Maraging Steel is being smuggled to Iran illegally from other countries. Grade 350 Maraging Steel is used for centrifuges, including the enrichment rotor rolls. The regime is also purchasing through smuggling from abroad a higher grade Maraging Steel to build the bomb casing and nuclear warheads.

Can't you say that about Ukraine too. The world loves to act like it cares but the lives lost are Ukrainian lives. And all that aid is really just loans. And those weapons aren't unconditional, they are using Ukraine for real life testing without riskung they're own citizens' lives. My prediction is that repeating WW2. Sell weapons to the fighters, wait for them to weaken and attack eventually when they are beaten down. War is terrible.

I don’t know if this is true but there are rumors that US has penetrated Iran to such an extent with cyberwarfare that if they need to attack they will “turn off” half their infrastructure like flicking a switch.

The more countries that have nukes the higher the likelihood they will be used which could result in a full on exchange of nuclear weapons between two countries and thus nuclear winter. There have already been several close calls between the US and USSR so adding more to the party only makes the entire world more dangerous. Totalitarian governments are also inherently more risky because your putting these weapons in the hands of one or a small number of people that can make these disastrous decisions. What if the dictator is paranoid, depressed, becomes mentally unstable? Clearly the world is full of irrational actors. There’s also the possibility of Iran selling nuclear weapons to allies or terrorist groups. And whose to stop them if the end result is nuclear exchange?
Much of the $53.7 billion that the United States plans to give Ukraine will be stolen in corruption schemes orchestrated by Ukraine’s military, oligarchs, and government officials. On a side note, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s net worth is about $30 million. He and his inner circle also have their own network of offshore companies. These have in the past been used to buy expensive properties in London. The documents also show that just before he was elected, he gifted his stake in a key offshore company, the British Virgin Islands-registered Maltex Multicapital Corp., to his business partner, who would go on to be appointed as Zelenksy’s top presidential aide. According to the Panama Papers, despite giving up his shares, an arrangement was soon made that would allow the offshore company to keep paying dividends to a company that now belongs to Zelensky’s wife. Convenient, right?
(Also, as wasteful as its military spending can be.... it turns out it is actually quite efficient comparatively speaking.).

Nooo! I had Doug Flutie as a coach at a basketball camp for a week when I was a teenager thirty years ago and he was just such a nice, caring guy... he even had a foundation for helping to send under-privileged kids to school that he was so proud of... what's happened to him?

Eh you wouldn’t even need someone to impersonate Mitch. Just tell Herschel something like “oh, no Mitch is the senate republican leader, they meet elsewhere on a different day” and he’d probably believe it.

The Afficionado Tendieso is a group I like. For the more refined gentlesir who knows the finest minds require the finest refreshments, this guild will help you pair your favorite tendies with the best Dew of choice. But beware: the guild master has an intellect that dwarfs even the most enlightened of gentlesirs. One poor kid tried to argue that Baja Blast was an inferior product and should never have been sold, and the intellectual trouncing he received was so savage the kid never fully recovered. Some say he still aimlessly wanders these lands today, a broken husk of a man with no purpose or destination.
Because that last line is largely bullshit that they want you to believe. The current party’s secretary is the de facto “paramount ruler”. At one point, he was both the party leader and the President, he’s the single most powerful man in Vietnam right now.

How in the Kentucky Fried fuck is that following a Chain of command? That is the exact opposite of how it is supposed to work. When a problem gets elevated to your boss he or she deals with it. Not push it down to your subordinates, that is lazy leadership or "leaders" not willing to confront any problems. I am disgustingly disappointed in how people act towards teachers and how the administration just rolls over the past couple of years. And parents who only now just show up to school meetings claiming that their son/daughter is being fed "lies" and being forced to use a litter box. Despite never asking their child what they learn every day or how their day was at school.

I'm in the UK and would LOVE to go electric. But the government insists on letting the private sector lead on infrastructure growth with fuck all meaningful incentives, and the private sector is slacking because not many people are choosing to buy electric cars. As a result, many people are putting off buying them.
I travel a lot for work. A LOT, all over the country. In some areas, I'm going to be fine. But if I get sent up to the lake district, many areas of Wales or frankly nearly anywhere north of Manchester, I feel like I'd be rolling the dice.

Actually getting hold of an electric car isn't really a problem. Like you said, there are incentives. It's the supporting infrastructure that's the problem.

I rented a Tesla in the UK and did a road trip from Cheshire to the Isle of Skye, which ended up taking about 12 hours due to traffic and having to stop. There are ways of making it work pretty much anywhere. When I arrived at the AirBnb I charged using a standard household outdoor socked the owner used for plugging his lawnmower in and gave him some money for the electricity. It worked fantastically well.

If the Republicans learned anything from the recent election, I hope it's that idiots like Gosar can be primaried by a quality candidate instead of a MAGA bat-shit-crazy candidate, and they might actually win the general election.
Too many attacks along too many sectors, which thinned out Russia’s best battalions. Too few infantry to screen the tanks. Inflexible air support. Artillery batteries that bombarded too many empty grid squares. And perhaps most importantly: inadequate logistics for what would become a long, grinding war.
Amid the chaos of the Russian army’s initial push into Ukraine starting in late February, it took a few weeks for the Russians to deploy their extensive jamming infrastructure. But once they did, they began deafening and confusing the Ukrainians’ most sophisticated systems—in particular, their drones—in numbers that surely startled Ukrainian commanders.

But it’s important to note where the Russians succeeded. If only to understand where Ukraine might need to improve its own forces. For a rare picture of Russian military competence, consider the Kremlin’s battlefield electronic-warfare troops.

The electronic suppression of Ukraine’s unmanned aerial vehicles blunted one of Kyiv’s biggest advantages in the early months of the war. The Ukrainians counted on superior intelligence—largely provided by UAVs—to make their smaller artillery arsenal more precise than Russia’s own, larger arsenal of big guns and rocket-launchers.

The Ukrainians counted on superior intelligence—largely provided by UAVs—to make their smaller artillery arsenal more precise than Russia’s own, larger arsenal of big guns and rocket-launchers.
But the Russians’ electronic warfare prevented those drones from navigating and communicating—and deprived the Ukrainians of the precision they were counting on. “The defeat of precision was critical to unit survival” for the Russians, analysts Mykhaylo Zabrodskyi, Jack Watling, Oleksandr Danylyuk and Nick Reynolds explained in a study for the Royal United Services Institute in London.

The Russian electronic-warfare force had become so potent that OSCE was struggling to keep its own drones in the air. The organization reported a sharp increase in jamming in 2021. OSCE’s UAVs experienced signal-interference on 16 percent of flights in February that year, 28 percent in March and 58 percent in April.

OSCE’s UAVs experienced signal-interference on 16 percent of flights in February that year, 28 percent in March and 58 percent in April.
That also is why Russian jamming didn’t work very well in the first few weeks after the Russians attacked in February. Russian battalions attacked, and retreated, too quickly for the E.W. troops to keep up.

Russia’s E.W. systems work best when their operators have plenty of time to set up and coordinate different functions. Which is why Russian E.W. was so fearsome in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russian and separatist forces held roughly the same positions for much of the seven years between 2015 and the current, wider war.

That finally began to change in March and April, as battered Russian forces finished pulling back from Kyiv Oblast in central Ukraine and repositioning in the east.

The Ukrainian air force’s fighter pilots were the first to feel the effects of escalating Russian jamming. “As Russian E.W. complexes began to be deployed systematically, Ukrainian pilots found that they often had their air-to-ground and air-to-air communications jammed, their navigation equipment suppressed and their radar knocked out,” Zabrodskyi, Watling, Danylyuk and Reynolds wrote.

Ukrainian brigades and batteries depended on two broad drone types to find Russian forces and walk in artillery: small, hovering quadcopters and octocopters; and larger, fixed-wing UAVs such as the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB-2. As Russian jamming confused GPS and severed radio links, these drones started dropping like flies.

As Russian jamming confused GPS and severed radio links, these drones started dropping like flies.
Russian jammers soon were thick on the ground in the east. “With the concentration of effort on Donbas, Russia set up E.W. complexes with up to 10 complexes per [13 miles] of frontage,” the RUSI analysts noted. “Collectively, these complexes effectively disrupted navigation along the front and conducted direction finding to direct artillery and electronic attack against Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs.”.

Of the thousands of drones the Ukrainians possessed in February, 90 percent were shot or crashed by summer, according to the RUSI analysts. This compelled authorities in Kyiv to plead with Ukraine’s foreign allies for replacements.

The drone-massacre complicated Ukrainian fire-control, making Ukraine’s artillery batteries less accurate—and therefore buying time for Russian troops to reconsolidate in the east and prepare for the summer’s fighting.

“The average life-expectancy of a quadcopter remained around three flights,” Zabrodskyi, Watling, Danylyuk and Reynolds wrote. “The average life-expectancy of a fixed-wing UAV was around six flights” and, “in aggregate, only around a third of UAV missions can be said to have been successful.”.

That the summer campaign ended badly for Russian army doesn’t change the fact that the E.W. troops did what the army asked of them: filled the air with electronic noise. “In the early phases of the fighting in Donbas when the [Ukrainian armed forces] had few precision systems, Russian E.W. reduced the effectiveness of these systems,” Zabrodskyi, Watling, Danylyuk and Reynolds concluded.

Actually it’s exactly right, and furthermore it’s still a problem. According to the article. And if RUSI is the one stating it (which is what Forbes based this article on) I’m going to trust what it says - that it WAS and IS a huge problem, and to extrapolate, those targets should be high-priority.

Long Island guy here and after 4 days in a row of 70+ weather and listening to my friends say things like "Global warming isn't all bad", I realize too many people will never get it. I'm like "Did you guys read what the warm water temperatures are doing to shellfish and algae, etc.?" Of course, they do not.

Thank you, I remember when I was a kid by November in NY it was already chilly. You’d have to wear a coat to school. Now I’m still walking around with shorts on.
The story with fur coats is not over. Fur coats turned out to be stolen from a clothing store in Kherson.
The owner of the store recognized her goods in the hands of Russians . The girl wrote that she went abroad on February 25, 2022, and the store was robbed.

Yeah I read that—they make a point that he was poisoned in Russia, and I’m wondering what’s going on beneath the surface there. Bc it’s trying to point out that not by military (ie, not by GRU in Crimea), and not when on leave back in Chechnya (ie, not by rival at home).

Either they’re faking bc they want to find a random fall guy, it is true, or more likely, it’s by his inner circle and trying to point away so don’t look weak. (Letter shields him from looking incompetent, like saying poisoned from unknown source would seem.) However, given that 99% of poisonings are done by the FSB, they could’ve released that detail because they want investigation/revenge/turf war. (Also, typically, they poison multiple items, then send sweepers to collect/clean, so might’ve already caught someone.).

Wow, a damning piece by Prigozhyn's mouthpiece Grey Zone channel, suggests (confidently) that the Vuhledar assault was an attempt by the Rus. MoD to take away some of Wagner's fame after Soledar. A serious attack on MoD with Wagner promising to "protect its prey".

See, Russians have very little goodness in them. No altruism. They can’t process that a human would ever ever willingly go do anything whatsoever “simply to help.” That it MUST be a cover, so therefore, must target it.

It almost seems that Prigozhyn is dead serious on taking over certain authority (not power (yet)) among the Russian army and the MoD is facing a major challenger in the face of Wagner, especially after catastrophes like in Vuhledar.

It’s a delicate dance bc the various factions (GRU, MOD, Airbourne Forces, FSB, Rosgvardia, Internal Affairs, etc.) have got to on the one hand say they need more money in order to complete whatever mission, while at the same time say Putin handing over more money doesn’t show that they’ve been incompetent up till that point. Since it’s difficult to balance that message, all the agencies actively sabotage the others. In order for others to appear more incompetent, or to say we can come in and do a better job.

Knowing Russians and their cynical mentality, I wouldn’t put it like you do. Yes, maybe in Syria (I have limited knowledge of that)—but anything you ever ever do to a Russian to attempt to show your pure intentions/innocence/nonpartisanship has the polar opposite effect. Always. They’re suspicious, paranoid, cynical. They think that if a car attempts to look humanitarian, then it MUST DEFINITELY not be that.

The other thing to consider regarding this is that in order to withdraw from Kherson, it had to be run up the chain of command—Surovikin to the General Staff, General Staff to Gerasimov, Gerasimov to Shoigu, and ultimately to Putin who apparently consulted back with the General Staff. He gave permission after was convinced that they could start regaining territory, if and only if withdrew from Kherson. They now have to deliver—they got to show a win, that the withdrawal was worth it, by having victories somewhere—anywhere—even if it’s stealing credit from Wagner.

I believe that Russia is most concerned by the Western weapon's deliveries and tries to get as much as possible now and then dig in as good as they can for the upcoming Ukrainian storm. But the results are terrible for them. Wouldn't be surprised when they offer soon a ceasefire.

LDNR were the original shtrafbattalion and sent to the meat grinder. The tactic gained Russia Popasna and culminated in Severodonetsk. It is believed that they lost almost 50% of their men, so now the LDNR are being mixed with mobiks to set up the new wave of Zerg rushes. The problem is when mobiks realize that they are the ones to be sacrificed for the Botox Bunker Dwarf, they turn back, and beg their families, which then reaches local administrators.

That was not a probing mission, you don't send entire brigades of VDV and marines to probe. It was their offensive, which ended in catastrophe for themselves much like everything they do in this war.
They've also found cases in animals ranging from seals in the Caspian Sea, minks in Spain, and grizzly bears in America.
So far, the cases have come from animals eating wild birds carrying the virus, and there isn't evidence of spread between mammal populations at the moment.

In the case of Spanish minks reports are fuzzy and inconclusive. Some sources talk of four cages being 'hotspots', with disease radiating outwards from these to nearby cages, implying minks capable of spreading disease. Equally, it's said minks were fed raw fish and poultry by-products, the latter of which may've been contaminated.

There was an ill pigeon in my garden and I called the vets for advice, also mentioning my concern about bird flu. I was told to bring the bird in, which surprised me So I caught it (wearing gloves) and took it over. Obviously the vet put it to sleep and I asked if it could be bird flu- his answer was 'yes, it could be. Why, are you worried?' I was like, well, it's bird flu.

"Prof Ian Brown, APHA's director of scientific services, said: "A sick or a dead wild bird contains an awful lot of virus. So scavenging mammals that will be opportunistic and predate on dead or sick birds will be exposed to very large quantities of virus. That gives a possibility for the virus to enter a host population that it doesn't normally maintain in.".

That's supposed to be the idea but when you take a step back and look at the big picture you'll see that we have 1 major political party that has turned into a fascist regime and our wealth distribution at its worst point in our entire history. If that's not enough, then what is? It was only the other day when our government's leader were feeding us disinformation in regards to a deadly disease that has now killed over 1M Americans ffs. What more could it take?
Yes? I mean only in the upside down world of Putin and his idiot enablers does Russia and Belarus have the right to commit genocide and terror against Ukraine but any response from Ukraine is "terrorism".
Actually Nato is restricting supply of weapons (airplanes, missiles) that can be used for attacking areas outside of Ukraine, as they want to limit escalation. These are big boys who have all lots of Intel and I'm pretty sure they know what they're doing.

Yes, it amazes me how their unhinged logic is twisted and turned. How dare Ukraine defend its self, how dare they retaliate. Only we can attack them. Only we can blow up their cities and towns.... but if they touch our Crimean Bridge its a war crime and an act of terrorism and we will retaliate ... more than we have already. I know it's just for domestic consumption but Russia would have to the must distrusted, disrespected and most ridiculed country in the eyes of the world right now. They just lie and make shit up with their shameless double speak propaganda.
TSMC and Global Foundaries have advanced the art of process nodes to such a degree that it's almost impossible for countries to spend money and will that level of manufacturing performance into existence. The network of suppliers that support TSMC to create their 5 and 7 nm nodes is extensive and none of them would risk selling to China. However, even having all of the raw materials is only a small portion of the puzzle. Intel in the US is one of the most well-financed semiconductor manufacturers...yet despite their prodigious piggy bank, they have had significant problems getting to 10 nm process nodes with acceptable yeilds, nevermind more advanced 7 and 5 nm nodes. Realistically, Intel is 5+ years away from having a real, workable 7 nm process node and by that time TSMC will be at 3 or smaller.
Also.... "Random" fires that kill people at their labs - \- probably won't help them. It was a few years ago, but I would expect more of the same going forwards.

If China is serious about developing their own home-grown advanced fab processes, they are a solid 10 to 15 years out from being able to achieve what TSMC can do today. The amount of effort required to secure their own fab industry is sufficiently high that I really wonder if it woudl be less effort on their part to risk war with the West by trying to capture Taiwan.
No. They were there to fight terrorists. But the dictatorship there is so far up Russias ass that it’s kicking out western troops that were keeping the islamists down and replacing them with Wagner scum (who have done their share of atrocities there alongside the Mali army).
The withdrawal of the French had a destabilizing effect, but the situation on the ground won't change at all with a German and British retreat.

I think all the civilians that were protected by both German troops and the German airforce would disagree. Germany was there for peacekeeping not to wage an all out war.

They died in a helicopter crash. The only NATO contingent that was there to actually fight a war were the French, the rest went to great pains to keep their troops out of harms way. Saying they were on vacation is a bit crude, but I wouldn't actually call this a combat deployment for them.

And now Al Qaeda and ISIS are probably going to topple the government. So you can tell the guys running the military dictatorship there are just complete geniuses.

>At least seven different federal courts dismissed this theory until it landed in the 5th Circuit, the nation’s Trumpiest appeals court. In May 2022, Judge Edith Jones—a Ronald Reagan appointee and hard-right bomb-thrower—wrote a 39-page concurrence asserting that the CFPB is funded unconstitutionally. Four other judges joined her. Then, in October, a three-judge panel formally declared that the CFPB’s independent budget mechanism renders the entire agency unconstitutional. Judge Cory Wilson, writing for the panel, revoked the CFPB’s ability to issue or enforce any regulations. (All three members of the panel were appointed by Donald Trump.) Thus, under the current law of the 5th Circuit, the CFPB effectively does not exist.

That could mean expanding the courts, term limits for justices, increased accountability/oversight and/or any number of other policy changes.

Mmmm take a gander at what is proposing, they want to make a state sanctioned camps to concentrate the homeless and mental health involuntary commitment. The time to act is quickly leaving us.
SCMP is just an extension of the Chinese propaganda arm at this point. Don’t let the fact it’s based in Hong Kong and owned by Alibaba confuse you. At the end of the day, the Chinese State controls what they can print. You can literally look up pictures of the pandas from yesterday and they look totally healthy.
Literally hundreds to thousands of people go to that zoo and see them everyday. And they take just as many pictures. The American people would be outraged if they actually saw animal abuse at a zoo so no way this would have been allowed to continue. Just think of how upset people off when they had to shoot Harambe a few years ago because they thought they were saving a child’s life.

For me they spilled over when they used “Mainland” to describe their country. There’s only one reason to use that when the context doesn’t call for that distinction.

I just don’t understand the need to lie about such an easily disprovable thing like animal abuse. Make America look bad? Why? What have we done to China to make them hate us so much?

I lived in China. I love China. Let me tell you, I saw so much casual and cruel animal abuse on such a regular basis that I could never have the time to write it all down.

They don’t need to be investigated because they have literally run a million local news stories talking about the pandas leaving and the pandas look totally fine. They are just really old. The were given to the Memphis Zoo on a 20 year lease which just expired. That’s why they are leaving.

I just don’t understand this constant need to project their own faults on to other nations. Probably because they aren’t allowed to talk about their own country’s flaws but they know they exist. So the just assume every other country operates the same way and covers them up.

If you follow geopolitics, it’s pretty obvious why they want to project U.S. in a less than flattering light. In fact, I find it impressive that you have avoided that shitstorm about Taiwan.

South China Morning Post should be banned from r/worldnews because it is literally operated by the propaganda arm of the CCP.
Something like 90% of the time and money in the 2020 election was spent in the 11 or so swing states. GOP pres candidate isnt going to go to NY or CA. But if you had to split the electoral votes according to popular vote. Or it was just straight up popular vote. They would spend time there cause it would matter. If youre a conservative in CA or a progressive in WV how many of you aren't voting for Pres. because you know its useless? I think thats one of the reasons for low voter turn out in pres elections. Unless youre in those couple swing states youre vote for pres doesnt matter.

Now, if the lame duck Congress can just actually DO something with the returns before they go home for the holidays and turn control over to the GOP who will immediately put the file in the sub-sub-basement, inside a locked rear lavatory with a large sign on the door saying "beware of the leopards".

Very similar experience here. Although learning about the ways other people live definitely helped me leave religion. Meeting and befriending lgbt folk in particular. Religion purposely creates a bubble of soothing simplicity that masks the vast and complicated realities of human existence.
I blame megachurches and nondenominational pseudo Christianity. Demagogue pastors are basically assuming the role of tribal warlords in rural America and enforcing a paranoid and primitive social structure. And unfortunately our capitalist overlords have found benefit in allowing their anti- intellectual, anti-government movement to flourish.

I’ve noticed that the degree to which conservatives hate an institution relates directly to how intensively that institution corrects error. Say what you will about the media, but most working stiffs at a newspaper would get in trouble for being wrong, and fired for lying. Scientists, their whole business is error correction. Snopes, it’s basically their mission statement. Academia, some professors are full of shit, but by and large they exist to seek knowledge. Therefore conservatives hate them all.

To apply the logic of the National Review, Democrats should have intentionally sabotaged their Democratic Senate candidates in Arizona and Georgia to appease Sinema. Sinema responded only after they won and Blake Masters and Herschel Walker lost.

Not to mention all of the promises that she made to her constituents that she didn't keep. She ran for office and won because she completely misrepresented her goals, beliefs and political standing. What a total fraud.

I understand that people can change their political party whenever the hell they want. The thing I don't really understand is how you can run for office in a specific party, have people vote for you because you're in that specific party, and then just be like "okay NVM lol!".
No stranger to controversial remarks, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump claimed in his 1997 book,The Art of the Comeback, that asbestos is “100% safe” and has gotten "a bad rap.” According to Mr. Trump, there is an anti-asbestos conspiracy, and that the movement to remove asbestos was actually the handiwork of the mafia.

Perry only generally wins in my estimation due to the same mistakes that always seems to be the issue with stereotypical old school Democratic party. They spend almost no money in general on this race dispite it being a winnable district. They put up bad candidates or candidates with no name recognition, spend no money on TV/internet/advertisement. I actually know quite a few of the folks living in the district who always try to convince the state and national party of this for it to fall on deaf ears. Basically, from my understanding the the old school Dems running the party in the area ignore them.

Something else Scott Perry has that Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz don't? A winnable district.

Perry represents the Harrisburg area in south-central Pennsylvania, which has flown to the left in recent years. In 2022, Perry's opponent got very little national attention or money, and didn't have a big-time campaign. Perry only won by 7.8 points - close enough that a better-supported challenger could take him out. This district also would have voted for Trump by just 4 points. While I don't have the numbers in front of me, I believe Democrat Josh Shapiro won it in his race for Governor. It's completely winnable.

But the way to win starts now. It means getting the word out about Perry and what he stands for - especially if you live in south-central PA. Don't wait for the Democrats to do it - take to social media and make a post. Talk to people you know. Start the momentum now.

And when election season kicks up, donate to Perry's challenger, or the PA Dems. Volunteer for whoever takes him on - you can do this from anywhere in the country. r/VoteDEM will have resources on how to do this (they're worth joining now to be aware of election happening right now, too!).

I was really rooting for Shamaine Daniels, I encouraged others to donate to her campaign. I wish their district race had been given more attention, especially considering he was in Trump's coup circle. But you are absolutely right, the area has increased in population and has been increasingly democrat.

As someone who grew up in his district when I was younger came here to say a version of this. This district is winnable and actually contains some of the most liberal areas of the state. (Harrisburg City, York City, and to a lesser extent the resort town of Hershey.) Dauphin county is the only full country in his district has voted blue in basically every race for like 20 years or more. As a matter of fact It is the only county in the center of the Pennsylvania that votes blue consistently in basically every election for the last 20 years. It is gerrymandered, but there is no way to overly gerrymander it, due to the surrounding area in general. But for some reason it seems to be an abandoned district by the Democrats much like other rural areas I have spent time in. Only it isn't very rural it is actually mid sized population center on the east coast. So it is a winnable district and should be considered a swing district and one that Democrats should actually be focusing/spending on.

I liked Daniels. It's a shame she didn't get more attention. Not sure if she'll run again or Dems will turn to someone else, but either way this is a race that should be prioritized. PA will need lots of attention in 2024 anyway.

Some of my family still lives in the district and told me they literally saw zero ads for Daniels the entire race but did see some for Perry. (By contrast at least one every commercial break for the Senate and Governors race.) It would make a world of difference if people from the broader Democratic party put more pressure on the state party to focus on this race and put the spotlight on how terrible Perry actually is.

Also, just for those unaware Perry is objectively terrible. He is a fascist, a criminal, he hates the EPA, his families business is responsible for poisoning his own constituents, he was directly involved in the insurrection and openly advocates for using the military to overthrow the US government. Among other terrible positions. Add to that the fact he is a retired general with real influence on the military just like Flynn and you can see why some of us have been concerned and advocating against this guy for the last 25 years. I honestly think if Perry got even a quarter the attention from the media and party they put into pointless other races Perry would have been gone years ago.

Right now, donating to PA Dems or to county Dem parties in the district would be the best bet. Help them register voters and build up a war chest to support Perry's challenger.

It is the same reason you have yet to see charges for Trump or other corrupt politicians. Basically, you don't win elections especially at the federal level generally, unless you have some skeletons in your closet doesn't matter the side. Sure there are likely some exceptions to this people like AOC but for the most part this is true. Holding these people accountable even when it is a particularly erroneous example opens them all up for accountability. So they have decided collectively to protect each other.

Add to that this specific case involves a cell phone which nearly everyone (I am sure that holds true of people in Congress) uses these days as a primary device. So if they search his phone as a member of Congress (dispite him deserving it and it needing to be done given the situation) this opens them all up to having their devices searched. Which in today's digital age is the absolute last thing most of them want to have happen to themselves, so again they are collectively protecting him.
See, when I first heard about this I assumed it was all federal programs, that is, all stuff that is obviously part of every year's budget. Hence Medicare, Social Security, the navy (wtf? Now there is a specific exclusion for the navy? Guess that's the only branch of the armed forces he cares about?) but actual laws that are enforced by agencies wouldn't be part of this nonsense. So, like, tax breaks? Yeah. Legal requirements to file taxes and the ability for the IRS to audit (only the poor)? Nope, that's safe.

When WILL they learn? Given that the average age of republicans is about 18 years older than the average age of democrats and that a recent poll says 86% of Americans do not want to see benefit cuts to either program, this seems slightly self defeating.

They've run someone banned from the local mall for creeping on underage girls, someone with clear brain damage, overt racists, multiple people with credible accusations of sexual assault. Liars are quaint in comparison.

That article makes it sound less like she straight up lied and more like people arguing about definitions. You can be ethnically jewish and nonpracticing, or even a practicing catholic. And thats without even getting into stuff about whether reform conversions ‘count’. (Pretty much only the ultra-orthodox don’t accept them and reform jews are by far the most numerous in america.).

It wouldn’t surprise me, but other than the most recent “Mike judge presents beavis and butthead”(which fucking killed it),I feel like a lot of 90s shows hard a hard time coming back now with out it seeming stale or peoples humor changing. We were all kissed off back then so more shit flew I think.

Edit: this took my brain to some strange spaces, and it turns out that while young Prince George could be speaker of the US House of Representatives, he is not eligible to be the speaker of the House of Commons; as the speaker must be elected from the members, and he is ineligible to be a member of the House of Commons due to his age <18 and peerage.

I don't personally own a car and I understand why people hate car based infrastructure on the other hand the vision zero stuff is completely unworkable and incredibly unpopular. They did this stuff in a couple neighborhoods in my city, put a stop sign at every possible intersection, banned potentially dangerous turns, made it impossible to go more than 10-15 mph on semi-residential streets and boy did that suck. It made it functionally impossible to drive in those neighborhoods and created a ton of traffic and everyone hated it besides the tiny but incredibly loud concerned parents coalition and the 20 year old non-driving intelligentsia. I think it was so unpopular that they ended it.

International competition can be a good and bad thing. Somaliland has made clever use of China/US tensions by openly supporting Taiwan in a bid for US support. Elsewhere I imagine if you're a leader who wants better terms for Chinese investment, you could play up the threat of going to the US or France.

The thing is, schoolyard, boxing ring, etc. is waaaayy different than the struggle of nations. Second place is, to put it mildly, unpleasant. All we have to do is look at what the Russians are doing in Ukraine now. Or in Poland and Germany in 1939 & 1945 respectively. Or the Japanese for decades. Or, or, or… Hell, the Assyrians were such violent evil assholes they still have a reputation thousands of years later. And they haven’t mattered in thousand of years. Think about that.

In the course of my life I have had a few fights, including as an adult. Do not recommend. But, I have tried my damndest to make sure I had the advantage. All the advantage. All of it. Why? Because losing is awful.
I'm not too hopeful for the peaceful protestors, in Syria the regime kept killing the peaceful ones until only the extremist ones were left (because duh).
Also a peaceful protestor who watches half their friends get shot by police stands a solid chance of deciding “fuck it, guess I’m a violent freedom fighter now.”.

I mean, halfway through the war we had literally hardcore Sunni fundamentalist fighters, all touting the same batshit ideology, shooting the shit out of each other AND other freedom fighters because they were backed by different countries or organizations.

This gave the loyalists much needed reprieve which allowed them to consolidate and then reinforce via the IRGC, Hizbollah and finally Russia.

Mass imprisonment and executions have been used by Russia, China, N Korea, and other nations to effectively control their country. It looks like they're banking of the making an example approach. 15K is relatively small when it comes to government mass executions, but announcing the executions vs disappearing people is relatively uncommon. If this were China, they'd publically execute 3 people and quietly execute 100K over this protest all the while claiming they champion human rights, but I guess Iran has a different culture.

Protesters have friends, family, people who weren't arrested. Finding 100K people to target for execution from 15K arrested is doable, if you want to go the Chinese route.

Right now George Santos manufacturing a fake resume to get elected to Congress is the least illegal thing he's done. He's also wanted for check fraud in Brazil, had a scam marriage for a green card, stole dogs from Amish dog breeders, raised money for treating a veteran's sick dog then kept the money and disappeared, and is facing potential charges from the FEC for lying about people contributing to his campaign to hide where the money really came from.

Genocide and faith are completely separate concepts to these people even with vast evidence that the evil was committed in the name of their faith. They can easily compartmentalize and validate antisocial behavior.

Christianity and Islam (Mohammed’s Caliphate was based on conquest & death and forced conversion). Both religions were complicit in mass genocide & enslavement. Farmers usually committed genocide or enslaved hunter-gatherers post-Holocene, like the Bantu peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa for example. The Roman Empire regularly practiced genocide.
Well, history shows that this sophisticated surveillance balloon has been part of recognized Chinese territory for thousands of years, and as a part of traditional Chinese lands, the American warmongers have taken a disappointing action in violation of national sovereignty that requires a response.
China isn't a friend to the US and would very much prefer a "multipolar" world in which there are several world powers they could play off of one another and they could have a sphere of influence in which no one else could say anything about what they're doing. You know, a cold war or age of imperialism sort of scenario, only with them on top this time. Something that approximates the way China was in any time before the 1800s.

It’s still about the loss of face. They have projected this image, to their people, that they cannot lose, own everything they may have visited thousands of years ago, and are destined to rule the world.

Yea and brinkmanship. The Americans publicly announced it (not saying that is wrong) and dealt with it. It leaves China having to either response or back down and they won't want to back down. So they will saber rattle a bit.

Let's face it, the US has outsized power and will use it aggressively. Sometimes for very good reasons. Sometimes for really petty and emotional ones. The US has the best military in the world and can put it anywhere they want, and they will do so for decades at a time even when that's not a good idea. The US has the leading world economy and is so interwoven into so much of the global economy that the 20% or so GDP badly undersells the influence the US has economically. The US also have a dizzying array of global alliances so that you're never facing off against just the US either.

Russia as well. That's why there is a war in Ukraine right now. It was supposed to cause a fatal breach in NATO between a dovish Germany and a hawkish Poland and Farnce, reveal the US as being too internally divided to support Ukraine and thus be untrustworthy, and maybe even cause such a bit of strife that an EU already wounded by Brexit might fold completely. The timing wasn't going to get better for a Russian attempt to overthrow the US-led world order, since time after Trump meant US would slowly regain some semblance of unity and credibility and the shocks caused by Brexit would end up overcome by European diplomacy.

Both China and Russia announced (and continue to reiterate) that the age of American dominance is over and a new world order in which the US is only one of many world powers with no special status to demand things like 'don't send ethnic minorities to camps'.

Of course, every time the US is able to present a unified front with their allies and convince Chinese neighbors to throw in with the US against China those claims from China are undercut. Just like every time the US delivers aid to Ukraine and the Russian military fails to defeat them the Russian claim that they are a leading world military is also badly undercut.

We can absolutely have a world order based on cooperation, but everyone would have to agree to ceding power to others. That's a hard sell, even relatively minor limits like the UK's membership in the EU imposed can be intolerable if the advantages aren't immediately obvious.

I, personally, doubt that these power struggles would get us. We can generally see these things coming. It's not the thing we see coming that will get us, it's either something unexpected and sudden or something quiet and slow that we won't be able to notice until its too late that will.

Things were the best they had ever been in human history. Even things falling off for a few years still puts us in an amazing place. No famines, a reasonable effective response to a plague, a good job market with historically competitive pay... Yeah, there's a hell of a lot wrong, but a lot of it was always wrong but we simply had bigger fish to fry. Now that we fixed most of the easy stuff we're left with the stuff that's really hard and to fix.

But we're actually aware that there are problems. Leaders come and go and are bound by public sentiment. Broken shit that leaders benefit from get fixed all the time. Reform is a constant process, sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't but nothing ever stays the same for long periods of time.

The fact of the matter is that Xi needs a signature success to hang his hat on. All the previous leaders had a signature policy that they can point to and say that was what made them great. Xi was originally on the "made China respected" train with the Olympics being a success and a 'coming out' party for China to be a co-equal on the world stage. Between that, the yuan becoming a reserve currency, and China taking the lead on a number of international organizations it seemed that was going to be the defining thing. But... a lot of that stuff didn't go great. The Winter Olympics they held a few years later had a lot of people questioning why there industrial parks mixed among the ski slopes and a lot of people were boycotting stuff over the treatment of the Uighur. So that ended up a bust.

Then it was "he stopped Covid". The harsh lockdowns stalled the pandemic in China even as it escaped to the rest of the world. If the harsh lockdowns keep Chinese people from suffering the way the rest of the world did then he'd win. Only, lockdowns only stall disease. They don't stop disease. Rather than having a signature policy exit strategy he kept on the lockdowns until the wheels came off.

Okay, so what other thing could Xi do in order to justify him being at the top for an unprecedented lenh of time? Well, there's only a couple of things since it needs to be grander than anything else he's tried. One of the big ones is "ending the civil war and integrating the foreign-dominated parts of China". Even Mao couldn't do that.

The problem is that there's not a good way to integrate the Nationalists on Taiwan. They aren't exactly going to willingly subjugate themselves to the whims of the CCP. Jumping the gun on Hong Kong and Macau makes any kind of talk about "one nation, two systems" into laughable nonsense. That leaves force.

They just need to throw in phrases like "10X MATCH" to make people think they're having a profound impact, instead of just funding Trump's lawyer fees.

I think he gave it to Trump. Everyone thinks I'm being silly but I keep saying, read the emails they send. They are meant to trick old people with dementia. That's their target.. They are barely different from foreign scammers helping someone get rid of a virus.

Spooked the shit out of me the first time it happened in the US. Pretty much had to chill out by reminding myself I've seen in on TV for decades so its obviously normal there.

Yeah, if the Ukrainian military surrounds the gates of Moscow, it's still an "oh well" to me. Don't start a fight, then complainabout losing. I feel for the people of both countries who didn't have a choice in the matter but there's nothing the Ukrainian military could do to Putin that would make me feel sympathy.

Yeah, the morality of the situation aside, you should make sure you can win when invading a country that you promised not to invade. Ukraine knows not to trust the word of the Russians.
And while they are at it they should be building manufacturing of advanced solar panels for every home.
It probably should have just been altered though, but that’s hard when several other countries are signatories.

Most countries have realised that batteries for electric vehicles is the only way forward, the UK is pussyfooting around by not building massive battery manufacturing plants even though there are two that are planned they both look like scams to get money from the government.

What should have happened is that the government spend the money to actually build battery plants and fuck private industry , yes it is that important.

You really think that NATO would sit idly in a war if Turkey is conquered and occupied if they loose a war of aggression?
The article does a good job of Sweden acquiescing to Turkey's demands, including handing over a 'terrorist' and dropping its arms export ban to Turkey, even as Turkey continues to make humiliating demands: firing a minister who attended a PKK rally ten years ago; demanding the names of rally attendees who criticized Erdogan; demanding the extradition of people who were granted asylum decades ago.

Not exactly, the difference between Turkey and Russia is Turkey can invade/oppress/kill foreign countries under the shield of NATO retaliation if it goes badly.

>In September Sweden lifted the arms export ban to Turkey, and in August it agreed to hand over a man whose name featured on Turkey’s “terrorist” list. The Swedish government insisted, however, that the handover was in line with regular legal proceedings, and that the decision to extradite the man had not been influenced by Sweden’s aspirations to join NATO.
I mean, I somewhat doubt that the state-employed and regime-friendly people that the morality police was made up of are abolished as well. One wonders which other position would be found for them.

if religiousness is but the means to the end of being in power, you might as well replace it with something that works better with the current generation. So fire the morality police and hire them back as your regular old goon squad armed with clubs. Certainly works for the Chinese, doesn't it?

Call yourself religious, call yourself communist, heck, even call yourself democratic. As long as you are only in power because of your ability to violently suppress the population, you are the same wolf in different sheep's clothing.
They’re kinda like a pilotless kamikazee plane with an explosive payload. They crash into stuff and explode rather than firing off missiles and returning to base to refuel and rearm.
Yeah that seems to be the TTP used in Ukraine. Israel has lots of technical knowledge in downing these Iranian drones in particular and they shared it with Ukraine. They also blew up an Iranian drone factory (I think it was in Syria but I’m not 100% sure). There are definitely some interesting fuck fuck games being played right now.

Expect to see more and more cheap piston or battery powered drones being used as short range cruise missiles in the future.

Really cheap cruise missile, basically. The main distinction between drones and cruise missiles is drones carry the payload, cruise missiles are the payload. Missiles and rockets are similar, but have their own distinctions.

I guess they won’t say kamakaze because it’s offensive or too Japanese? Instead, some editor failed to understand that the drone is not alive, therefore it cannot commit suicide, and that killing someone else is not called “suicide”.
Yes. Just didn’t go into the specifics. It’d be nice if they could have two different alerts at least rather than the alarm and then telling us later it’s not an important one. Like one for a threat and one for an actual attack.
This isn’t news. They give us alarms when planes take off. It doesn’t always mean anything is happening. Just that it could be a plane with missiles. They usually end rather quickly. It’s very normal in all countries for aircraft to take off and land.

In the apps it would be easy enough to have one that says “planes took off” and then upgrade it if there’s an actual missile launch. Obviously the outdoor sirens shouldn’t change.

Yep exactly. Show us proof then. I wanna see that he’s been in Hollywood the whole time. Show me the lies, I really wanna know. He is a professional actor so your making a lot of sense. Or just admit you’re middle aged in Florida and make another totally epic boomer troll post. Also your post history had me and the boys rolling on the floor, it’s like a insane asylum’s community diary.
Well it's not WW2 anymore. There is no bank secret anymore, Swiss politicians worked during WW2 with the Nazis together, that's a fact but Switzerland worked with Jews/ Israel after WW2 together to pay back whatever it was, Switzerland wasn't neutral during the cold War, neither during the Balkan war or the annexion of Tibet, Crimea, etc.
This law has also led to the fact that Switzerland no longer sells weapons to Russia since the takeover of Crimea by Russia or that the supply of weapons to Saudi Arabia has been stopped.

Many here absolutely understand about the Gepard ammunition. But it is a law that would have to be adapted by the Swiss population. Normally, changes in the law here take several years.

The text of the law reads as follows: "No sale or transfer to a war zone..." It is a pity that no war in Europe was taken into account.

In some ways I wish Switzerland had the same experience with neutrality as we did in Norway. And that is that it lasts only until someone stronger than you decides to piss all over your neutrality.

In a situation like the one in Ukraine, where a larger stronger neighbor invades you, there is no moral neutral ground btw. By deeming yourself "neutral" you are in reality helping the attacker.

Reading it over, it's... An "interesting" law suit. Unclear if it will succeed. DoJ's request for a dismissal is legitimate, in that unraveling this onion gets into the issue of executive privilege vs executive authority, which could get messy super fast and that the basis of this suit exceeds its implied scope.

Its not about gaining new voters its about using any means necessary to enforce a white Christian nationalist agenda on America. Violence, lies threats is completely justified in order to reach those goals. The GOP might implode but they will take down the government with it. These people are religious zealots and we need to take that seriously. History has shown over and over again zealots are extremely dangerous.

So this article makes it seem like there was an entire ring that was in on it. Multiple people brought in and confirmed the act with both women. As we all know, when a woman is in the presence of an armed person who is going through their phone to look for evidence of them being at the protests, it gets them aroused to the point where they want to fuck multiple men right there in a van...... No one can honestly believe that these women were not under threat of violence for these "consensual" acts.
There is no misrepresentation of rape. It’s rape. The validation of this behavior is one indicator, of many, as to how absolutely fucked up this ideology is. The government of Iran can go get fucked.

Agreed, but this kind of paranoia is what passes for logic in oppressive regimes. "We can't tell the truth about any bad thing that's happened, or our enemies will use it to destroy us.".

Iran should be publicly parading these guards before sending their asses to prison to show people they care about women. It would be lies of course but at least they could pretend to try.

The DOJ will likely not comment on anything to do with this hearing and will continue with their confidential records investigation as it has the most straightforward facts to date. This case is going to be difficult to prove for the DOJ as it has a large amount of assumptions of dialogue that have to be proven with such a high profile jury case.

I would very highly doubt that they will take up the recommendation for these charges against Trump, but other members of his inner circle will likely be caught in the crosshairs.

There were aspects of this that were both complicated and petty, on all sides. He was officially, at one point, King of Greece, which was a constitutional monarchy but did not have a merely ceremonial monarch at the time, and he didn't treat it simply as ceremonial, getting himself quite embroiled in political messes while being quite politically inept. Much of his life, even after being deposed, was heavily affected by political and diplomatic machinations involving him. There were significant impediments to him living a normal life, and in some sense, his grifting was one of the clearer options for him after being exiled. He was not simply part of the extensive worldwide royal-roleplaying community of descendants who style themselves with titles long abolished, keeping track themselves of make-believe lines of succession that, absent the decisive force of state power, inevitably end up splitting off into disputes that will never be resolved.
On the one hand, at one point, he was stateless, with his Greek citizenship revoked because, the Greek government stated, he couldn't be a Greek citizen because he didn't have a surname. On the other, he chose to continue to be stateless rather than ever adopting a surname. He lost most of his possessions and property (personal, not just state) fleeing a rather brutal and regressive military dictatorship that could well have killed him, but it was also his political ineptness that heavily contributed that dictatorship taking power. He spent much of his life trying to force Greece to give him huge amounts of money, property, and possessions, but then when he was able to get some comparatively small amount of money back through the ECHR, the Greek government made a bizarre and petty show of paying him by taking money out of a natural disasters fund. He continued to try to insist on getting property back that was dubiously personal rather than former crown property, but there were always rumours that Greek governments refused to give many of these not because they went to good state use, but because many things had disappeared into the hands of the well-connected during problematic periods of Greek history (not just a royalist rumour, and perhaps even more common amongst the left, because the dictatorship was far/weird-right). He was a figure that was known throughout Greece, but was also known more as a target of mockery than anything else. He wasn't the only person to continue to call himself King of Greece long after he was deposed; many Greeks did as well in some contexts, only, not with quite the same tone of voice or meaning.

wow great summary... the post war Greece Political theater was a flying circus. you had to think during policital studies classes in school back in my youth, that "this was the place where democracy started???" (my ancient history class was before PS class) ya the ancient world was a totally different animal, but it seem like it was way better then what was going on in Greece during the 60's-80's. between the assinations, corruptions, bombings, coups.. you think there wasnt any real goverment.
Sweden still has "many steps to take" to win Turkey's approval for its NATO membership bid, a top Turkish official said Tuesday as Sweden's new prime minister visited Ankara in hopes of eliminating the hurdle to his country joining the military alliance.
Sweden and Finland abandoned their longstanding policies of military nonalignment and applied for NATO membership after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, fearing that Russian President Vladimir Putin might target them next.

But Turkey, which joined NATO in 1952, has not yet endorsed their accession, which requires unanimous approval from existing alliance members. The Turkish government has accused Sweden -- and to a lesser degree Finland -- of ignoring its security concerns.

Sentop said the Turkish parliament welcomed Sweden's decision to remove restrictions in the defence industry but said groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists were still able to conduct "propaganda, financing and recruitment activities" in Sweden.

Kristersson wrote Monday on Facebook that "we will do significantly more in Sweden through new legislation that provides completely new opportunities to stop participation in terrorist organizations." Sweden would also support NATO's counter-terrorism fund to support the alliance's ability to fight terrorism, he wrote.

Sweden's new center-right government is taking a harder line not just toward the PKK, but also toward the Syrian Kurdish militia group YPG and its political branch, PYD. Turkey regards the YPG as the Syrian arm of the PKK.

Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström told Swedish Radio there were close links between the PKK and the YPG/PYD, so Sweden would therefore "keep a distance" from Syrian groups in order not to harm relations with Turkey.

Edit: Maybe it wasn’t clear enough that I don’t find any of this a good thing. It’s never a good thing when fascists get away from responsibility due to loopholes. It’s never a good thing, if they’re influential on the government from the outside.

All 30 NATO member countries must officially ratify the accession protocol for Finland and Sweden to join the alliance. Only the parliaments of Turkey and Hungary have yet to do so.

The worst part is that this plays right into the Swedish right wing agenda, as the fascist party "Swedish democrats" recently finished second in the election and have a lot of influence on the newly formed center-right government. They are well-known racists, with high-ranking members previously supporting and attending Nazi events, and they want reasons to cleanse the country. It's even better if the pressure is coming from outside, so they can blame it on global politics. In the 1990s, one of their goals was to deport any migrants who arrived after the 1970s. Although their strategy has since changed, to be more subtle and less extreme, their views on the matter has not. So while it may look like Sweden is bowing down to Turkish politics, in all honesty I think it serves the Swedish fascist parties too.

I mean based on his recent TROOFs and such it's clear that he thinks they lost because they're not maga enough. If the Republicans go with desantis he will absolutely run as the maga party or whatever. The grift never stops.

Well it’s a waste of time because even the ‘good’ Americans just throw piles of excuses at each of these but here goes:
Please, in detail, with due consideration to all of the political and societal realities that granted, the US has brought upon herself - tell us how to fix this? Also, please tell us why all US Citizens should be tarred with the same brush?

Realistically, it’s easy for you guys to say “we’re too far gone” - that’s been your argument since like the 1900s. Other countries have your legality on firearms but they have a disciplined population who don’t need to be treat like children to avoid mass shootings.

Eventually, the GOP will have enough power to stop the investigations and that's how this ends. That's what they're waiting for. In the meantime, they must continue to appease the masses, without actually doing anything, so they "investigate" until they drop the investigation and blame it on the Republicans.

It wasn't and yeah, the GOP has done worse politically in the midterms than literally anyone expected. But does that matter when at the very least people like Boebert and Hawley should be in jail for participating in a seditious plot?

It's sad that people keep trusting the DOJ and acting like this investigation isn't like the others. They've done enough investigations. The evidence is overwhelming. It's obvious to everybody capable of critical thinking that isn't a member of their cult. However, the investigations must continue because there isn't enough "evidence" yet. The truth is, there will never be enough evidence.

How many high ranking politicians get charged, found guilty, and sentenced to jail for their crimes? Do you think none of them commit crimes? No, many of them do. However, they're above the law because convicting a high ranking politician, or president, of a crime "reflects poorly on the US" and billionaires are untouchable because the amount of money they can spend on lawyers.

I guess he never learned that that's a rather common thing for babies, and they often have some level of deformation after passing through the vaginal canal. Then again, that would require sex ed classes or something... and I doubt Herschel would ever sit through one of those when he could just cut checks to expectant mothers and drop 'em off at abortion clinics...

Clearly the man has had a penis in his mouth at least once, why else would one be so publicly, virulently homophobic? (Long hot steamy post game showers are needed to unwind properly I’m sure) Just saying, no hate, no criticism, do what you gotta do long as it doesn’t hurt anyone.

"Election deniers" hold their asinine beliefs in spite of ALL evidence. The GOP tried to overthrow the election, not just via a coup attempt at the Capitol, but with a series of 60+ frivolous law suits, ALL of which were rejected by courts across the country due to total lack of merit. Trump's latest suit against HRC and dems was likewise dismissed and accompanied by a heavy bench slapping and the imposition of substantial financial penalties against Trump's lawyers for wasting the courts' time with their sham.

The ONLY appropriate response to the willful idiots on the right is disdain. They are trying to destroy American democracy via both fraudulent and violent means, and refuse to pull their heads out of the sand, as it were, despite numerous and ongoing attempts to explain why their "beliefs" are not only false, but incredibly dangerous and harmful.

The problem w this is that it desensitizes normal people to brutality and when you do that you run the risk of rearing people in that society who are desensitized to brutality realizing they're desensitized and using that as a platform to elevate themselves.

It's why I think all executions should be broadcast to the public. The reality is that I support the death death penalty. However I feel like it should only be used in extreme cases. I also believe it would act as a better deterrent if video was publicly available.

I'm with you on the death penalty. We fucking know nikolas Cruz did that shit. Take him in a room, spend 15 cents on a .22 round and be done with it. Then bury him in an unmarked grave. Maybe even in a mass grave where we just throw the worst of us to rot until there's nothing left.

I am not one of those "boomers who think television makes people insensitive to violence" but I am. It doesn't make sane, rational, and/or empathetic people insensitive to violence. I believe that group of viewers is the majority but it also exposes the minority of psychopaths to that shit and makes them feel it's not profoundly abnormal.

If you took a sampling of popular movies, tv and rap/heavy rock music and shook it up you could dissect a murder a minute from what huge portions of our population pump into their brains when in reality almost none of us will ever experience an irl murder. That shit has been normalized by more than just the people doing it. It was normalized before that. And again, it doesn't just have to be acceptable to the common man to have an impact on society. It only needs to radicalize a few people out of hundreds of millions to have the impact we are feeling now.
Dude no one gives half a shit about Andrew Tate come on. This is normal procedure when you are after a criminal ring. They have other people under surveillance and they are after more evidence that need time to gather. Subpoenas etc take time.
I can’t reply objectively or constructively to that. Right Off the bat you’re already loaded with bias and arrogant undertones. It’ll just turn into insult fest like it always does with these kinda threads. It’s so silly.

It could be something like they know there is evidence however they can't find it. So the judge is extending the detention to give more time to prosecutors to find stuff.

2. Russians are forcefully displacing people 2a) so Russian soldiers are free to steal washing machines, 2b) so locals don't help Ukrainian army, 2c) so locals don't tell about Russian war crimes, etc.
The fact that Putin himself is taking the responsibility of telling people to leave the city has me worried. It makes me think he might use a tactical nuke there, or is another commenter mentioned, he might blow the dam and flood that whole area.

As horrible as blowing that damn would be, I really don't want him to use the tactical nuke. That sends the whole world into uncharted territory, and I don't think I have enough canned food stored up to survive a nuclear winter.

So it says that the religious exemption is only for non-profits. While the legal protections in terms of the government and what marriage grants you is good... But are we sure we want to force people to participate in things that they disagree with religiously, or even if it is something that they don't like? Since there isn't a problem in finding people to make your wedding website, bake your wedding cake, or anything else like that I can't understand why the government can force you to participate in something you don't want to be part of. What happens when it is something you disagree with down the line? My inner libertarian comes out for stuff like this and I can't help but be against anything that forces someone to participate in an activity they don't want to. Like, just hire someone else.

Kind of. Yeah. It's been working out fine. Especially if it is religious. How can the government tell you to participate in something that you believe is a sin and has been stated so even before said government existed? And either way, it isn't discrimination when it is fundamentally different.

And yes, this is fundamentally different from interracial marriage because that is just skin color. Same-sex marriage is different because man and woman actually serve a different purpose in terms of the family and reproduction element which is what marriage is kind of about.
You say this pact had the goal of fighting fascism, of which the USSR was truly based on. Talk about spouting drivel. Stalin was out to protect himself above all else. This move to court Europe was to improve trade, nothing more. The USSR (and all other countries) are always actively promoting national ties, that's their job. What Stalin did behind closed doors may or may not have abided by any promises, or insinuations, he made with them. Stalin was a very inept leader that was mostly concerned about preserving himself, he would have made promises to anyone for that goal. Try and learn world politics and history before spouting off on here. It will save you some embarrassment.
Because of that, East Germany never had any de-nazification programs like West Germany did. It's a reason why right wing political parties have had more success there after unification compared to the western part and a reason far right wing parties have gotten more power in Eastern Europe in general after the fall of the USSR.
They right away took him off of suicide watch. Now one of two things is true - either his cellmate tried to strangle him, which meant he was a target for murder - or he tried to kill himself which meant he should have been still being watched. Instead they chose to credit neither - they took him off suicide watch and did nothing to protect him. They placed him in a cell where two different cameras were not working - so no one could see who came and who went from it.

Fear mongering, populism, fake news and divisive politics. Exactly the elements that brought you Trump and Brexit. Additionally, since Israel is a parliamentary democracy, meaning that the prime minister is the person who can form a coalition from the multitude of parties, unlike in the US where it's only two parties, Bibi was willing, unlike his adversaries, to pretty much sell out the country for sectoral parties with exorbitant demands to benefit their own sectors on the expense of everyone else (eg, orthodox parties). Despite all of the above, he lost the previous elections and was close to losing this one, mainly won due to bad organization of the opposing bloc. While his party is the biggest and he is immensely popular the same way Trump is (ie personality cult), there is a very significant opposition to him across the political spectrum.
To be fair Israel is becoming a text book example of fascism, it’s not all the way there yet but it’s definitely heading that direction. the way Israel treats Palestinians is awfully reminiscent of how other fascist governments treated marginalized groups that they used as a scape goat.

Anytime you hear a GOP sound bite complaining about regulation, this is what you’re hearing. Remember a few months ago, all the complaining about hiring 30,000 new IRS employees?

School is six months followed by roughly six months to get certified after you arrive at a unit. So typically 12 months.
But those 12 months assume no familiarity with air defense, tons of time spent on general training/random stuff that can be cut, weekends and holidays, and lukewarm support on arriving at a unit.

Given the proper motivation and support, I think you can make a well trained reload crew in a month and a certified van crew in three. Especially, if you have some people who already have experience on their own systems.

If we sent them a single radar array connected to just a single line battery that’s still at least 100 people. 6 launchers with 16 missiles each, they could effectively defend against a strike of 75 missiles which is about the size of the strikes they are being hit with now.

In the US, a Patriot battalion (600 people) consists of a headquarters battery, a maintenance company, between 4-6 line batteries, 6 launchers and 70 people per line battery, and 16 missiles per launcher. That means a battalion could effectively launch over 300 defensive missiles at once across all batteries.

14E’s (the brains behind the patriots) go through a lot of school. The 14T’s not as much in school but training to setup and tear down in a proper maneuver element takes time.

I think a 30% sales tax -- which would effectively be 40-45% after state and local taxes -- could actually tip the scales and lead to true riots.

Not that protest bullshit that Replications like to call riots -- but real ones, comprised of people violently targeting shipment trains and stores.

A 30% price hike on essential goods, which will include utilities, will shut the lights off on probably about a fifth of American households. That means the elderly and sick are going to freeze or cook in extreme weather, there will be no way for many of them to cook or bathe, and no food storage. I think that's where you're going to see the country fold in on itself.
José Aldo is ridiculous, dude was born in poverty and suffered himself all the inequality this country has to offer, to what? To support Bolsonaro late in life. He totally forgot his roots, fuck him.

Yeah except brasil has a history of picking bad presidents. Also half of them are very right this time. Lula nearly destroyed the country last time he was in. It would be like if the UK re-elected Elizabeth Truss if she ran again.

Define conservative, that’s a pretty fucking broad term. Could mean anything from right of centre to deregulated free market hellscape. Why am I “conservative”? Because they represent my values and opinions better than progressives, they also have a far better understanding of the economy.

Because it’s very debatable if Lula was directly responsible for the economic progress in Brazil at the time and not because of the actions of the previous government of FHC.

However, I believe universities should be as cheap as possible, I believe information should be free to be shared as a collective instead of being hidden behind a stupid amount paywalls. I believe we should have social security nets to help people who fall onto hard times, god knows I sure did. I’m an atheist and I think religion should be completely fucked off from legal everything, religion should not play a part in laws ever (ironic considering the “god knows” last sentence). I believe abortion should be completely legal up until a point and after that point have progressively more restrictions placed on it, I do not believe “I changed my mind” is a valid reason for a third trimester abortion. I believe that if you’re gay and like dick then fucking go for it, same for lesbians, idgaf unless you’re sexually harassing me, but then the issue is the harassment not the being gay. If you’re trans same shit, I mean why the fuck would I care? I don’t plan on dating a trans person, the though makes me feel weird but fuck I’ll call you Alyssa if you really want me to idgaf. I’m all for reducing pollution from litter and plastics. I think there should be some restrictions to the economic ecosystem to stop monopolisation and price gouging. I believe in science. I believe the process of legal immigration is pretty shit and needs reworking. I believe the legal system needs a bit of a reform and that police should be trained for longer and be subject to yearly audits to ensure they’re conducting themselves properly. My mother is black, I’m mixed so obviously I’ve not got any dumb racist opinions, be kinda counterintuitive to hate myself for my race instead of the slew of other reasons I could hate myself.

I’d still be typically considered a conservative and yet I’ve proven the typical “conservatives are just evil” is fucking stupid. It’d be like saying “progressives are just commies” it’s not true. Yes, there are some conservatives who are so insanely conservative they’re just horrible people, but there are also progressives so progressive that they’re nothing more than a brain dead yes-man for ideas that are kinda nuts. I’m conservative because currently not a single progressive politician running for power has a single sensible idea. At least not here in Australia and not in the states or brasil either.

They released THOUSANDS of murderers, rapists, human traffickers, and drug traffickers all to get one dumb fuck out of prison. I am ashamed to be Brasilian and yet unsurprised considering they once voted in a literal terrorist and bank robber.

It should never be a choice between terrible and worse, but since we got to this point, we might as well not pretend that one is great because the other is terrible.

Well I suppose we’ll have to agree to disagree on that. Lula is one of the most corrupt politicians to ever live and I will not be surprised at any assassination attempts or successful ones against him once he drives Brasil into the ground again.

Both can be terrible, and pretending that the guy who was in charge of Brazil’s two largest corruption scandals is anything good, just fuels the opposition.

Ignore the idiots saying it’s not. It 100% is a shit show in Brazil rn. There was a 0.9% difference in votes between them. Honestly I think it’s more divisive than the trump elections were.

I don’t like socialism. I especially don’t like communism, they’re wonderful ideas in theory but i know for a fact they won’t work without mass indoctrination over generations of humans, I sure as fuck wouldn’t still be an engineer if I could get basically the same amount to do jack shit. I hate the overtaxing that most progressives want. I don’t agree with deregulated abortion, I believe there should be limits placed, a 30 week fetus is not the same as a 6 week embryo and should be treated differently. I don’t believe in neopronouns at all, or the excuse that adhd and autism make you experience gender differently, I have pretty severe adhd and a friend has autism, neither of us feel like we’re actually a cat gender cloud or some dumb shit. I want the government as far out of my life as possible, I don’t want them watching what I do daily. I want to be able to protect myself, I don’t want to be held accountable because a criminal broke into my house and fell down my stairs that don’t have rails (this actually fucking happens in Australia and the criminal wins the court case every time). I don’t want dumb shit like misgendering someone to be a jailable offence. I believe in protecting borders from people illegally entering the country, whatever country that is. I ABSOLUTELY NO NOT believe in the abolishment of the police, especially if you want to impose anti gun laws as well. I do not believe men should be collectively held responsible for the actions of a few dumb fucks. The list goes on.

You mean the one where he lowered the bar for poverty? Like didn’t actually raise people out of poverty, just made is so “poor” was classed as lower income than it was before he changed it?

You realise he did that by lowering the poverty line right? People who were considered poor before weren’t after he “fixed” it despite making the same amount of money as they did before.
Also, currently the UK's government has a lot of positions that are basically just legacy positions from the days of monarchy. While maintaining these positions is likely pointless at best, and a drain on public resources at worst, they are nonetheless representative of some sort of cultural continuity with the UK of the past.
So I guess I'd be curious to hear from Brits how much cultural continuity they would like to keep. Could the royals and all of the nobility be removed and lowered to the same as the rest of the citizenry? Should the class of nobles and royals become even more symbolic by, for example, electing a representative and simply calling them King or Queen and pretending? Or should a singular family, by mere quirk of parentage, be propped up as a national symbol to be argued over in perpetuity?

They can propose amendments if they want, they don't have to be accepted though. The House of Commons has all of the power, the HoL can delay certain legislation, but really that's all it can do.
As someone who knows nothing about classified documents - my view on it is that probably not every classified document originates with some authority that checks them in and out to credentialed borrowers. Someone compiles some info and maybe stamps CLASSIFIED on it and then hands it to someone like Biden's team and then it gets forgotten. It never made it to the national archives or whatever body is responsible for recording them so nobody knows to ask for it back. This isn't for every classified document, but for all the people asking "why didn't the national archives ask for them back at some point?" ... I would guess that the national archives didn't know about them. I just find it hard to believe that as soon as something is marked classified it has to be immediately sent to the archives and all the bureaucracy that entails before anyone else is allowed to look at it.

Went to a school where the girls regularly had to line up and kneel in front of the principal so they could measure if our skirts fell within 2” from our knees. All the girls that were rolling their skirts would just unroll them before they got measured and re roll them on the way back to class. If these schools honestly have that much of a problem with short skirts why don’t they just make everyone wear pants? Why even have skirts as a uniform option.
Oh and the principal of their school knew and did nothing about it, told the girls they were lying and that’s probably what discouraged them from coming out overall.

At the time they wernt doing anything about it so I tried to by telling my school counselors and they pretty much said unless the girls come out about nothing will happen, everyone refused to come out about it and I imagine that pedophile creep is still working there.
It wouldn't take much to deny him the position. McCarthy is promising everything to get the votes from extremist, it's not unreasonable that if the dems have a unified front, they can convince a some republicans to vote for someone else if they are promised something of worth. Basically selling a vote for some politicians agenda.

I think the dems only need to flip 5 people to have a majority vote on the matter, and there are republicans in districts who could still do well if they sided with dems, as it's pretty apparent that republicans just want to do nothing and obstruct as much as possible.
I have a hunch that Wagner doesn't take "no" for an answer when recruiting prisoners. Also, it's prison and they were promised freedom so they wouldn't hear from their previous fellow inmates anyway.
I can't guarantee it's the case of Russia. But I've had friends go to prison in very secure countries.

True. But also their relatives get to see the same propaganda about how Igor The Child Eater came back as a free, reformed man and is now a war hero, so I'm not entirely sure what they know or "know".

If Russian prisoners are anything like American prisoners they have more information than many people on the outside do. All they do is talk and listen in prison, and massive amounts of info from the outside comes through the doors everyday.

“Putin told the Russian people that Kherson is part of Russia. Therefore, he will need a story (which may even include some facts) to justify the withdrawal and distract the domestic audience from it.”.
The article doesn’t mention what facts those might be. But it says it seems like Putin is setting up the military to be the scapegoat. And will continue attacking infrastructure with long range munitions to help distract from the loss of Kherson.

Privatization is a dangerous scam. This is a lesson we should have learned in no uncertain terms after the past 4 decades of the neoliberalism era. If anything, we should be smashing privatization across many, many, many industries instead of finding new and horrific ways that it can seep into what little it hasn't already.

Medicare Advantage is a total rip off. Do NOT get suckered into it. Stay on Traditional Medicare Part A & B then purchase a Medigap Part G (Plan G or Plan N) but only from a long term reputable health insurance company like United Health Care. Also get a Part D Prescription Drug plan but check that meds you need are in the Tier you are purchasing. Frankly ask for Tier 3 coverage and pay $27.00/mo so that whatever your doctor prescribes is covered. Better to pay the premiums and have the medical coverage than to get fooled by $0 premiums and Give Back benefits advertised on TV by has been Sports and TV Stars when your copays will be 80% higher than traditional Medicare and your yearly maximums are less than 10% of what traditional Medicare covers. As you research know that Medicare has been forbidden since 2018 from commenting negatively about private for profit insurance companies and absolutely forbidden from telling you that Medicare Advantage is a total rip off of You and the Medicare Trust Fund.
This finding is fascinating. It's long been an open debate among archaeologists whether burnt animal parts near early human/humanoid tools were signs of cooking or just a wildfire that passed through the area. It's been almost impossible to rule out accidental wildfires.
> "This suggested that the fish had been cooked at a controlled temperature rather than just burned," study co-author Irit Zohar from Tel Aviv University, Israel, told DW. "Until now, no one could prove that Homo erectus cooked food. This is the first evidence that erectus had the cognitive ability to control fire and cook food.".

"Until now, no one could prove that Homo erectus cooked food. This is the first evidence that erectus had the cognitive ability to control fire and cook food.".
This finding may have resolved that dilemma. First it's evidence Homo erectus went fishing. But more even more important: wildfires typically burn at temperatures of 800 C/1470 F. The chemical structure of these fish teeth remains is evidence of a lower temperature burn, under 500 C. The chemistry probably can't pinpoint the temperatures closer than that, yet it's good enough to rule out natural causes and place this in the range of cooking temperatures. And it's near what seems to be something like a fireplace or a fire pit.
This finding may have resolved that dilemma. First it's evidence Homo erectus went fishing. But more even more important: wildfires typically burn at temperatures of 800 C/1470 F. The chemical structure of these fish teeth remains is evidence of a lower temperature burn, under 500 C.

One of the few technologies that all human societies have in common is cooking. Food safety might be one reason. Another is cooking makes nutrition more bioavailable.

If you look back a few centuries, most of Europe believed that eating raw vegetables was incredibly unhealthy. So they'd boil everything within an inch of existence.
and there I was, sitting there, very innocently by the way, had your Beautiful First Lady, you all know who I'm talking about, and all of a sudden I see my people, they're coming up to me, "Sir, Sir," I said what is it, "it's the Radical Left, Sir, they're trying to get Allen to flip," and we don't like Flippers do we folks, and I know a lot about it, I've been watching it happen for a long time, you have people who are maybe good people and then some things happen, we're talking bad things, and then they're maybe not so good, and then there are what you would call some problems, and we never have problems under Trump, but then you look at what's going on, Sleepy Joe stealing your Taxes and using it for Late Term Abortions, it's horrible what they're doing. we used to be over 100% under Trump but now, now we're Dead In The Water, ok, you can thank me whenever you feel like it, have a nice time, don't forget, you wouldn't have a Constitution without me.
I hate how prosecutors use the threat of indictments to get witnesses to cooperate, either they committed a crime by breaking the law or they did not. Leniency for cooperation should ONLY be available during sentencing, not for indictments. One of the best recent example of this is Jeffrey Epstein’s NPA. Another example is the prosecution of Cohen while Trump walks free.

I agree with the article headline, the West should change course in Ukraine by immediately providing all the conventional military support possible that Ukraine needs to drive Russia from their lands. Ukraine is willing to spill their own blood to secure their future, so let's give them the tools to do so and end this war quickly.

Ukraine isn't going to stop trying to get their entire country back and will continue fighting Russia and Russia's surrogates as they have since 2014 when Crimea and much of the Donbas was taken.
> “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”.
I heard some"expat" living in Qatar being interviewed yesterday downplaying the migrant labor thing, talking about how happy the security guards seem. Then she talked about how hot it gets in summer and how just walking 20m from the doorway to her parked car is an exhausting ordeal, without any mental click between her ordeal in having to walk across a parking lot and the experience of people working construction jobs in that heat. Just complete self absorbed "expat" shit, like "there's a real community, people from all over the world", like yeah, no shit, you're in an expat bubble hanging out with expats.

The lack of a specific number is pretty concerning in and of itself, shows a careless disregard for life and an absolute complete lack of accountability. I mean imagine telling OSHA between 100 and 200 people died at your work sites... first of all is it 100 or 200??

That's... That's not a good defense. "Look, it's only a small fraction of foreign workers that we throw into a meat grinder with zero concern for their welfare".

They made decisions that killed hundreds of people. In most industrialized nations, there are laws on the books to hold them accountable.
I meant infected in the sense of the virus entering your body. Vaccines do not stop a virus from entering your body. What they do is allow your body to gain the ability to fight off a virus. Some vaccines are effective enough that the virus is killed by the body before the virus has a chance to cause the body to show any symptoms of infection. That is what immunity is. You are immune from the effects of the virus. Also, your body may be able to kill the virus before it can be transferred to another host. Obviously, some viruses like influenza, and covid, reproduce and evolve at such a rapid rate that the antibodies created by the body in response to a vaccine to deal with the virus are no longer effective against new variants and additional vaccination is required.
Because no vaccinations stop you from becoming infected. That just isn't possible. Vaccines allow your body to deal with a simulation of infection and produce the necessary antibodies to fight the infection without also having to deal with the additional adverse reactions that a live virus brings. Once you are vaccinated, if you are infected by the real virus, your body already has the tools to put up a much better fight than if it had not been given a trial run via the vaccine.

In many cases they say it revolves around a suicidal crisis. A majority of mass shooters researched were suicidal before or during the shooting. A lot of mass shooters see this moment as their defining one, as their last hurrah.

People here and the media are so quick to dismiss her as a quack. For reddit it's because she's seen as some crazy new-age hippy loon with her background in spiritual crystals and such. For the media, they dismiss her because they don't actually want to discuss her populist, anti-corporate progressive ideas.

Why on earth would Trump ever be tough on China, though? They were funneling money to him via his hotels when he was in office, and they gave his daughter a ton of trademarks. He even pays more taxes to China than he does to the US.

its really obvious that the data was obtained through crime, and released through the blind computer repairman as a misdirection. It's reasonable, IMO, to ask for a criminal probe to see how that private data was acquired. Get Mr Cross-Eyed golf-hat on the stand and start asking some uncomfortable questions.

I just saw something the other day, validity still suspect, that attempted to quote him as saying he was afraid for his health and his life and is holed-up in his house, not leaving.
It's totally true, and their accusations tell us so much about what their values are, about what they think is right and wrong. Defund the IRS, are you fucking kidding me? They are so brazen and revealing, it's weird to see right through your political enemy. There's no nuance or strategy, just brute force there. They are masterful at keeping their voting base's brains mush to keep them in line. It's such a fascinating and such a distinctly American breed of fascism. The books written 20 years from now about this era are going to be absolutely wild. I mean, I learned all about the Know-Nothing party back in school, but shit, that was in the 1840's. They're nothing compared to the modern Republican party's voters. To have literally all the world's knowledge at one's fingertips at any time, and to still be as willfully ignorant as the right is, is truly astounding.

Plenty openly call for it, but far from a majority, and their apparatus of minority rule has been deteriorating for years now. The centrifugal forces of factionalism caused by their conflicting incentive structures are now exceeding the centripetal force of party unity. And that’s just the latest of their problems.

Picture a Venn diagram with three circles: the rich, the racists, and the religious. Each with different interests around the outside but lots of similarities in the center. All of them hate the government. The rich thought that they could control the racists and the religious. The racists and the religious have now become increasingly mainstream. The path ahead frightens me.

As someone who turned 13 when the GWB error started, I've longed for this party to die. I'm not sure if it will fully die but it's for sure sicker than it ever has been and that's off-putting to most Americans. That's why the GQP does everything in their power to rig the game in its favor.

I'm beginning to form the opinion that the American people done deserve things like Healthcare, a living wage and a fair tax structure, etc if they won't even vote in a way that's obvious to facilitate these things. I don't want to feel that way but I'm starting to. Anyone with half a brain and the most rudimentary of googling skills can debunk nearly all republican lies and propaganda and yet election cycle after cycle more and more average people (not your typical republican zealots) allow themselves to be duped. I grow ever increasingly tired of it. I grow tired of advocating for the benefit of the poor and working class that seemingly can't be bothered to educate themselves on a basic level to do it themselves. I'M on the pathway to success (nearly a 6 figure income in my 20s). I WILL NOT be needing social security and Medicare when I retire. I'M gonna be more than fine. It's THEM who needs these programs and yet these same people in the working class continue to vote republican and corporate shill democrats thereby fucking themselves over and then wondering why their lives remain shit.

Unless I am missing something, the basis of calling the coin authentic is the scratches that are consistent with having being worn in a purse? Because no fake coins were ever found in purses . I thought editorial standards were a bit higher at the beebs.

There's different kinds of fake. These were presumed to me be modern fakes trying to pass as ancient coins, not fake ancient coins trying to pass as real ancient coins. Basically this proves they're likely not a hoax, and that they were in use, however briefly, in ancient times. That use could have included faking a different ancient coin, but I'm not sure how widespread that practice was and whether it really disproves the existence of the guy whose face was on the coins. After all, finding a fake pound with the picture of the Queen on it doesnt disprove the existence of the Queen, quite the opposite.

I am interested in the coin as a means to prove the existence of hereto unknown Roman leader who presumably supervised the retreat of the legions around 270 ad. I didn’t come across his name until now - I’m not a specialist but take an interest in the Roman presence in that part of Europe.
It does make a mad kind of sense, he his running through devolvement at a rapid pace, clearly he has gotten help from Russia and China but that is only half the game, he needs to bring his missiles and his people up to a modern competitive standard, and there is zero way to avoid getting the experience by drilling. He is also doing it in a very provocative way but the people on all sides can see real advancement and a structured program. I will add to that Kim will be testing nuke warheads again soon, this may or may not be in conjunction with China or Russia, but let's say your Russia and you really need to test your nuke stockpile or new designs but how are you going to do that with the world watching?
What if Kim Jong Un is telling his people that they ARE hitting targets. For all we know the news in North Korea could be showing CGI of burning cities and equipment telling the NK people they are winning.

Can you imagine if they actually think they’re hitting targets. Like they have no clue how incapable their military technology is. After seeing what Russ’s rolled in to Ukraine with I wouldn’t doubt it.

More like just straight up stolen footage from Mars Attacks! of burning buildings and cows and a dead skull headed alien that is labelled "American" then Dear Leader smiles at the camera.
Yeah I've started quietly doing this again as well. It's not really out of fear of catching the virus, more that I absolutely have not forgotten how my fellow citizens behaved at the beginning of covid with regards to panic buying. I'm planning on having maybe a month or two's worth of stuff to weather the initial storm. Had a very bad feeling twice in the past 5 years - one in December 2019 when I saw whisperings online about some sort of virus in China, and one in December 2021 when I saw videos of Russian APCs with parachutes attached being mobilised in Belgorod. I've got that same feeling again reading current developments around bird flu.
Yeah, I made a video on the bird flu a few months back when the vast majority of shorebirds on the West coast of Northern Europe died from this. It took forever for the news to report on it in sidenotes. Then it vanished again completely. Now, there are trickles of news here online but just trickles. Here in Germany, the only sign of the bird flu is a literal sign near my house that announces a bird flu observation corridor.

My tinfoil hat theory about Sinema is that she was a Republican plant placed in the Democratic primaries tailor-made to lose the general elections by being too far "left" and "one of those people." Only, she failed by actually getting elected and has since made up for it by being a constant roadblock to Democrats. I fully expect her to lose her primary, attempt one last sabotage/fuck you by running as an Independent, and then spend the rest of her days running the conservative media circuit anytime they need a "former liberal" to shit talk Democrats, aka, the Tulsi Gabbard/Dave Rubin route.

I fully expect her to lose her primary, attempt one last sabotage/fuck you by running as an Independent, and then spend the rest of her days running the conservative media circuit anytime they need a "former liberal" to shit talk Democrats, aka, the Tulsi Gabbard/Dave Rubin route.
I don't disagree, I just fully expect her to be delusional enough to try, and you just know she's going to get some of that sweet Republican dark money from GOP megadonors.
Thanks. It's Sunday so I'll put aside some time today to read up more on Brazil. I just have a very top level knowledge, but always found the place fascinating.
wow just saw that’s from 7 years ago. I think about it often. It really is interesting just how dumb money is.

I don't follow Brazil closely, but this seems like encouraging news. Brazil has the resources to be a major economic power but it always seems to go haywife.

From what little I know, Brazil could be a major player in every industry. As a yank, all I can think of is like Venezuela, corruption in politics has been institutionalized. It's a disease that is hard to get rid of. I would love to see Brazil kicking ass again.

Corruption in politics is definitely spreading here in the US as well. It's always been present, and anyone who thinks otherwise hasn't been paying attention. But it's just growing at such an alarming rate now as regulatory capture has been rammed down our throats by the GOP and their uber-rich financiers. It almost feels like it's illegal in the US to prosecute embezzlement, tax evasion, or libel - so long as the person doing those things is rich.
My theory is that aside from the ego boost she got from making like Arizona's answer to Evita Peron speaking in front of adoring crowds, Kari might also might not have been as financially set for life as one might think after her long career as a 'star' anchorperson in the local TV news market in Phoenix. Maybe she lived beyond her means or got into some bad investments. This overnight conversion to MAGA politics might have been a cynical money grab for her.

Work from home is a win win. Workers get to avoid spending as much on commute. Businesses don't need to spend as much on rent/facilities since they can downsize a lot there. It doesn't really hurt anyone except for those with a hardcore loyalty for tradition for the sake of tradition.

Which isn't a bad idea, the problem is convincing corporate America that its OK to allow your employees to work remotely. Actually, its convincing the 60+ year old CEOs who are mostly funding the GOP that its OK.

Roads have to be paid for somehow, and automobiles have negative externalities, it makes sense to have roads at least somewhat paid for by people who actually use them. I think it could be fine to, say, do something like have a rebate for people below a certain amount of income for the time being perhaps, while green stuff grows and becomes more affordable, but still.

The EPA seems to think there IS a way to prevent what's happening. So does the DOJ (who've filed 2 complaints and have now involved a third party) But hey, if you've tried nothing and are all out of ideas, I hope someone who gives a fuck is managing the $75 million for water infrastructure projects included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Biden signed in November 2021.

"Reeves also addressed the NAACP’s assertion that Jackson received money from the state revolving fund only three times in the past 25 years by noting that the city has only applied three times. Jackson, he said, did not apply for additional funds in fiscal 2022.".

The state of Mississippi is beyond despicable for their laws that have caused this to happen. The federal government should step in under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and completely redo Jackson's water infrastructure and then take the money from Mississippi's federal grants, making certain that these come from the top income earners of Mississippi, not the poor.

i always wondered about just how much collateral damage is wrought by this entire iron dome concept of missile defense . you have a missile incoming , let's launch another one over our own territory to intercept it . i suppose a hit just rains debris over a large area alleviating a gigantic blast but a miss just doubles the effectiveness of the initial launch . so is war ?

Never forget that the cause of this is ultimately Russia. In a war on close borders this will keep happening. An unfortunate accident that gives the tiniest taste of the reality of everyday for the Ukrainians.

The Department of Education will announce it is extending the freeze another six months with the first payments due two months after June 30, the source said, unless a Supreme Court decision on the president’s student loan relief program comes first.

If you travel more than like once a year, you should look into a travel card with lounge access or consider joining Priority Pass. You get free food and drinks, or in some cases you get a credit to spend at restaurants. It's such a value proposition, it's so easy to spend $100 in an airport bar with 2 drinks and a meal.

Grab and go airport food is the worst. Not only does it cost twice as much as it should, it's terrible quality. $15 for a "salad" with processed chicken and bagged lettuce. Bleh.

Oh yeah I'm with ya. I try to take a protein bar and some baby carrots to the airport with me, but when that's not an option, airport food it is. At least some places will have like Greek yogurt cups and fruit. For $10. 😂.
America: That's not what they told me, they said it was over so fast they couldn't even tell if you were in their country.
If this is such a smart ploy by the US, can Russia not outsmart them by pulling back all the troops and stop the war? No-one else wants this war other than Russia.

At least, it's irrelevant when it comes to defining the term. The obvious relevance of where the propaganda comes from is who you need to target as a country in order to stop it. Something that has been seemingly neglected by our intelligence agencies as of late.

Opportunity presented itself to sell weapons, a major industry in the USA especially, to a righteous cause. While simultaneously demonstrating the ineffectiveness of a competitor's product (Russia). Barring the use of WMDs and internationally-agreed-upon illegal activity, Russia is a military failure. Their kit is a joke, their troops are a joke, and they need to be stepped on internationally, publicly, and decisively.

Those same joke fucks are working to undermine US domestic security (power grid attacks by "domestic" terrorists), international relations (shoveling fossil fuels to China and India), and Democratic stability at a global level. Just to steal some land they willingly relinquished any right to DECADES ago in a treaty. The Russian government is a joke that can't reliably provide stability for its people, who they control by a frayed thread via state sponsored media. A travesty of modern governance on par with the failures of North Korea.

I agree but he's also pretty powerful, still. In a decade we'll look back at this guy and laugh like he's Abid Mahmud. But while he is the voice of the Russian government, all acting like a bunch of terrorists, he kinda needs to be acknowledged.

I think that it's important to recognize the influence of targeted propaganda in mobilizing alleged "patriots" to actively betray their own country. And to rationalize that betrayal based on lies and stretch truths versus the reality evidenced through their own senses.

Self-identifying 'patriots' drinking the Kool-Aid and betraying their country for some imagined political end goal is pretty much the definition of domestic terrorism. Whether they get the ideas in their heads through foreign powers pushing propaganda or through local conspiracy theorists is irrelevant.

There is no real proof that Lockheed Martin is profiting of this war, or even encouraging it at all. And if it were true Russia could still end the war very quickly. I don't think the sanctions would come of now while Crimea is still in Russia's control, but the arms to Ukraine probably would if Russia just went back to the 2020 borders.

I agree, although I would say it differently: Hoping this war shows China that we are serious and willing so they will not take another conflict to the edge to change the current status (read: Taiwan).

I also think (I know this sounds like a conspiracy theory and might be one) that the majority of people in power in the west are in favor of creating a worldwide recession to crash the economies of primarily Russia but also China. As mainly consumers the west will face hardship but not a existential threat. As an energy producing country Russia will have their entire economy wrecked, and for China as they have not managed to grow any local domestic consumption compared to the west they will also meet much more serious economic hardship at a time when they already have economic issues.

So, give em to Ukraine, let them beat some serious ass, and then start cycling new gear across a buffer zone of nations that stand to lose their autonomy should this pointlessly imperialist modern-day Russia decide, on a whim, to exert control over their neighbors.

This is a real tired and old talking point arguing both sides when there really isn't both sides here. In addition just super low effort literally saying "Lockheed Martin lol" with no evidence at all.

Get more or less gifted some of the most modern weapons systems available because they all joined NATO and are considered trusted allies in exchange for dumping some ancient gear and reinforce the position of the "fuck you Russia" bloc. Wins for everyone but Russia. Fuck Russia. The Russian military is a failure that can't win without resorting to terrorism and scorched earth policies. Garbage.

We experienced an elderly family member who chose to pass on their own terms via the MAID program. There are many misconceptions about how it works. It took multiple months of interviews and assessments with physicians, counselors, and nurses before approval. Canadians are not going to just walk into a MAID clinic, fill out some paperwork and die. Depending on circumstances it can be the most beautiful, dignified way a loved one can pass.
If ever I decide I truly need to find my own way out, this would not be it. I wouldn't be able to tolerate the first two appointments, let alone all the rest.

So you're saying you want people to be able to kill themselves without seeking any help? You just reinforced the reason why we mandate tests before allowing people to proceed.

Agree. Witnessing my family member jump through all the hoops was an emotional roller coaster. He qualified - then didn’t - then did - then tried suicide -didn’t work - then when just days from a natural death, the MAID team approved and his suffering was over.
What if we're in a movie trailer and the Transformers, the Fallout Series, and the Simpsons for that matter are all only relevant to us since we're in that trailer?

This is a big step, but not the grail, that would be stable plasma confinement in a tokomak. This does allow us to gather a lot of data on fusion reactions, a notoriously difficult circumstance to achieve.

You ever watch a movie which makes a reference to some mass media thing which only exists within the canon of that film? Think like how in the Simpsons, they have Itchy & Scratchy, but it only exists within the Simpsons.

Ignition was achieved a few years ago, this was ignition with an energy output greater than the laser energy, a first ever. Laser confinement is not considered a viable energy source however, it is not turning into electricity, rather they measured the heat energy released (or some other similar method). The point is that reliable, repeatable fusion reactions can give a lot of insight into how to get successful conditions for this and other fusion reactions.
Apparently, it was a traditional Japanese bear hunting knife attached to a pole. They would've shot it with a rifle, but this happened in a school so maybe they wanted to avoid stray bullets.
In addition to your point I'd be surprised if animal control the Agricultural Promotion Division in Japan has quick access to firearms, especially the kind of rifle you need to safely bring down pissed off 175 pound wild boar. That may depend on the local wildlife situation though. When I lived there I remember seeing news about a problem bear that kept coming into a town in Hokkaido and they basically had a couple of designated bear hunters.

Wild boars are pretty bad-tempered animals at the best of times, and looks like it was well within a dense urban area so piggy was probably in a thoroughly angry and annoyed mood.

Your English is fine. It's hard to explain but it's like if Germans are famous for being being on time, drinking beer, and eating sausage. If you said one of those things "I always try to be on time" it would be normal, but if you say all three in the same sentence "I like to be on time, drink beer and eat sausage". The German might wonder if you are joking around and teasing them. You just said a few very common reddit things together .

I think they see it and that they don’t care. Republicans have doubled down on authoritarianism, racism, and bigotry at every single turn. It’s not a mistake or lack of recognition they know they are the bad guys and they don’t care. They only care about enforcing their narrow and bigoted worldview on everyone else. We have to fight back against this shit in every single way possible.

Can we do an exchange program? I'm in a red state but I'd be happy to exchange MAGAs for migrants at a 1:1 ratio. At least the migrants want to be here, want to contribute, and aren't trying to bully their way into power.

Am curious what the % of UN refugee claimant inflows is per capita. That I think would be more telling. I’m also curious how many of Canada’s refugee claimants are in Canada as a result of the U.S. having granted them visas - also very telling (since I read somewhere once that a big chunk of Canada’s refugee problem, which is more per capital than the US’s) is due to the U.S. allowing so many people in, especially with tourist visa issuance at U.S. embassy’s abroad, and then they hit the road for Canada once they land at US airports, and that illegal crossings into Canada are because the U.S. can’t control its own southern border.

Because 36,000 refugees have been coming from New York to illegal crossing points with Quebec, the Canadian government has been trying to get the US to renegotiate it and change the agreement on that front, but has been facing resistance from the US.
Also, for the folks unaware and all “war is terrible”: the russian war machine made the spectacularly sound decision to place live ammunitions right next to the bunker 😑.

Russia is a deeply alcoholic and broken nation. We should not ascribe rational decisions to a body that has thus far failed to exhibit rational decision making behavior. They may continue to feed the meat grinder for much longer thinking that the west will eventually run out of ammunition and weapons to supply Ukraine. (Narrator: they won’t run out).

Some truly believe they are fighting NATO forces, and the majority of Ukrainians didn't fight. So by that logic, “NATO will run out of ammunition” doesn't sound as crazy. What they don't realize is, for example, reports of Ukrainian army speaking foreign languages doesn't mean that they are fighting NATO troops. It means that a lot of Ukrainians know at very least English on top of Ukrainian+Russian(and that Russian soldiers have no clue how heavy Ukrainian accent sounds). Plus, the % of Ukr army which are foreign volunteers is pretty small. And EU countries aren't lying when they say that their army (except US observers, but that wasn't really a secret) isn't directly on the ground (projection of pathological liar as usual).

Hilarious that these idiots still cling to the idea of small government when every Republican since Nixon has expanded the federal government’s powers. Same with fiscal responsibility. The deficit balloons under Republican presidents. It’s all a joke. They’ve got nothing to offer except tax breaks for the rich and self righteous anger. That’s it.

Spot on. The GOP is not known for their introspection. Their only solution to losing elections is to change the rules, gerrymander, and suppress votes. It's never their shitty policy ideas.

Yup, The voters used to be conservative. This is why even Democratic presidents were conservative or moderate, but the voters are becoming more liberal and progressive-leaning. The GOP knows this so for them to stay in power they either need to change or end free elections. They have picked to end free elections.

Young millennial and Gen Z voters now outnumber voters over age 65. They can have all the power if they vote in high enough numbers. In this election, only 27% of voters under age 30 voted, but they voted 65% Democrat. Look at the result. Imagine if even half of them voted.

She's been de-platformed before and could be again and isn't getting multi-million dollar offers for brand representation, etc. like Kanye was. There's not really much else to "cancel" her from and anyone that's not also racist or a hard line right winger or q nut thinks she's a loony. You can't remove someone from elected office if they're racist, you just have to work to get them out, but when she lives in an area that votes for her there's not much you can do. Strom Thurmond was racist as hell and served in the senate for 48 years into 2003 for example.

Well let's see he has been vice president without issue, has been in congress in some capacity for the better part of his life without issue. He ran for president without issue and has so far been doing his job without issue.
It's a no-brainer that these people are using them, simply because of the utility, GPS(!), and communication, plus they provide entertainment for people who could be out there doing literally nothing for hours. I do wonder if they'll suffer the same side effects of GPS tech that we do, though, where a lot of people have lost the ability to navigate and stopped learning streets/routes due to reliance on GPS, which isn't a bad thing for us but is a bit sad in the context of people that have been there in those lands for ages.
Because everywhere else conservatives are actual conservatives who wanted gradual progress and not just rebranded fascists that want to undermine democracy. The actual conservatives in the US is the Democratic Party.

And they don't identify themselves as conservatives. That's the problem with you Americans. You guys think every right-wing parties as fascists and every left-wing parties as commies. You guys think the others as extremists so you go the other way even harder. It's just self-fulfilling prophecies at this point.
You are correct. General Yamamoto wanted to eliminate the Pacific fleet. He knew the USA was a problem for their plans. So they knew if they eliminated the fleet, they would own the Pacific. And with all the signs pointing towards an attack, the Pacific fleet commander at the time(whose name escapes me) ignored it. That's why pearl harbor was so significant. Even though the Japanese thought it was a success, Yamamoto knew it was a failure that they only got a few battleships and none of the aircraft carriers. Then it came back to bite them in the ass when they tried to surprise the USA again with the battle of Midway, which the code was cracked and the USA led a counter attack. Even though it was almost a collosal fuck up. Luck and a Japanese fleet commander who was too by the book was what lost the Japanese the Pacific. China can't think that siding with Russia, who is blundering themselves in Ukraine, is a good move. If they think that the rest of the western world is weak, then they deserve the demise they will bring on themselves.
If I recall correctly the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour believing that the US (a spiritually/militarily inferior country) would cave, sign a peace treaty and leave them to their devices.

I wonder whether China has fallen into same delusion having observed US divisive/corrosive politics for many years e.g. Marjorie Greene (WTF) etc. I believe the recent balloon incident was a test of American resolve. "Hey, you're not so tough. I wonder what else we can get away with?".
Good thing the have been building artificial islands around it for years packed full of ASM’s and SAM’s. They are unlikely to make the same mistakes the Russians did in Ukraine.
They have been anticipating our response. There is a reason it’s an admiral saying this. He knows Taiwan will be invaded and the Chinese have been building artificial islands around it for quite a while now to ensure that they have plenty of SAM’s and and anti ship missiles. They already have their defensive measures in place for when they seize Taiwan.

1) Russia is not losing, retreating to save military personnel is not losing unless you do it on your own ground (you don't treat annexed territories as Russian territories, do you?), or suffer heavy casualties. It is a stalemate situation for now, neither side is winning by now. (Germany wasn't really losing WW2 until 1943, when they suffered a major defeat in the battle of Kursk, though USSR was counterattacking since the beginning of 1942. Cities changed hands up to 6 times in that counteroffensive. So what is happening now is nothing but a swing of a pendulum of war, and considering the slowdown of Ukranian forces, the pendulum is about to swing in the other direction).

2) this warmup forced Europe to give much of it's arsenals to Ukraine, which means there are not that many weapons will be available when the real show starts, if it starts at all.

3) considering weapons, it was proven not all the weapons sent to Ukraine get there. Part of it (up to 70% by some reports, but even if it is 25%) are lost in the eastern Europe, and some of them were already tracked in Poland, Germany and Finland. So in case of total war Europe can flip into a land of men not willing to be drafted, facing economical difficulties due to energy crisis (buying gas for triple the previous price does not overcome the problem of energy prices) and armed. That's not a place I would like to be, so I suppose the all-out war is not to be looked forward to.

Schoolteachers can barely afford to rent a house in Tennessee, and now they are going to be in classes of over 40 kids thanks to trying to rescind class limits. Now, teachers are going to have to carry guns in school. Nothing bad could happen, like a kid getting a hold of a gun in school, right?/s.

We are not sending a good message to children when school staff is armed and conducting active shooter drills. We're telling them schools are dangerous places to be, places they may die, and more kids are going to be struggling with school phobia/PSTD.

We'll outside of schools we have police and soldiers that are armed performing active shooter drills, preparing for war, etc. Schools are places people die just as people die outside of schools.

While arming teachers maybe wont reduce shooters at school, I think believing it will contribute to more violence doesn't really add up either.

We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

I poke my head into right-wing areas every so often to keep a bead on things, and this is honestly the closest to an anti-Trump consensus I've seen among right-wing people since 2015. Actually, Trump basically didn't exist as a political leader for them at all prior to 2015, so I think ... since his rise to power, really, I've never seen so many of them turn on him.

This will be the pivot. Watch conservative shock jocks start to shift support to a quote-unquote winnable candidate in DeSantis. However, what would be really entertaining was a party fracture over this. The Republican party has dogwhistled to the Trumpopulists for too long for this to go over smoothly. The party will want to push with all of their media power to get support for a more run of the mill Republican. Trump's ego will not be able to take this and much of his support base will not accept the pivot. Imagine if Trump runs as an independent/third party candidate, splitting the vote significantly across the entire country delivering the Democrats a strong win in 2024.

As a purely uninformed outsider opinion, it’s almost better if the Dems don’t send him to jail, as this would not only make it easy for the GOP to select De Santis but also galvanise the Republican base. Let them fight and don’t interrupt your opponent while they’re making a mistake.

I think you're right. Looking at the comments on Fox news and /r/conservative right now, this might have been the silver bullet. Comments range from "I love him, and he did good things for the country, but it's time for Trump to step aside" to "he's going to ruin us in 2024 if he can't keep his mouth shut!".
It's not though. Taiwan alone accounts for 65% of the semiconductors and 90% of the advanced chipsets manufactured worldwide. A large scale conflict in Taiwan causing manufacturing stoppages would cripple the global economy. It would make the multi-year chip shortage caused by covid look like a mere hiccup. Not to mention that if China were to gain control of those factories, they would then have the ability to inject whatever spyware they want in those products natively and create mass security threats in electronic systems everywhere.
That was like 25-30 years ago, China has made it extremely difficult for other countries to export stuff since, literally the only one that still does is the U.S, and even then a lot of arms packages given to Taiwan in the past 20 years have been pretty lackluster until now.

Also after from the la fayette deal that resulted in not only taiwan getting totally taken advantage of but also the deaths of around a dozen people involved, its unlikely they would go with the French again even if they could.

Though unlike Ukraine, my guess would would be that other nations would be far more willing to get directly involved in the fighting if Taiwan was invaded.

TSMC has basically made themselves the most invaluable company in the tech industry so yeah, nobody wants to see them fall into the CCP’s grubby paws, outside of the CCP itself, and maybe Russia too.
Maybe you missed where I said that I agree rules are rules? I'm not saying don't go after tax evasion rich or poor but considering the IRS has proven time and time again that they are far more interested in going after the poor rather than the rich and given that they lowered the threshold to report from 20k to 600 says once again their interests are in people with lower incomes. Just google "irs disproportionately audits poor" and then search for "wealthy taking advantage of tax loopholes". They go after small fish because the big fish are too much work.

So is voting for a third party. It doesn’t matter if a two-party system is good or bad. It’s just what we HAVE so deal with it and vote for the lesser of two evils. I couldn’t believe the Bernie Sander supporters that didn’t vote for Hillary. In what world was Trump a better choice? Be practical, not idealistic. My daughter will have less civil rights than me because of a Puritan Supreme Court, a scary future with a powerless EPA and ridiculous amount of student debt. The conservatives won’t go down without a fight. There is no compromise for them. I wish liberals and moderates would stop bickering and put them back under the racist hateful greedy rocks that they slithered out from.

Democracy versus fascism sure is a fun game when for decades have decided to empower fascism through replacing the value of a vote with a corporatocracy funding policy directives.
Respectfully thinking people can’t pay attention to other matters AND this seems to wickedly undersell peoples ability to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time. Toning down pretty egregiously bad stuff in the spirit of not putting up a noticeable fuss is part of the reason Santos got elected. I’m not sure how suggesting the media continue to do it’s charade of reforming Greene by toning down her nonsense is an intelligent idea for keeping people informed of the things that impact them. No one else seems to have a problem with noticing other things also going wrong.

I think the issue is that most of the migrant workers know the conditions (or ability to even find work) in their home country is the same/worse than staying in Qatar. That is why the moved to Qatar in the first place.
The problem with Qatar is that it is a rich country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world and wanted to host the World Cup to show the rest of the world that it has achieved equality with all the industrialized nations. But at the same time, it’s labor laws/regulations are about 50-100 years behind those countries it wants to be equals with.

As for drugs, it is the same issue but we can at least vote to change our policies at the local and national level and change is happening right now because any individual can be a catalyst for real change in America, even if it doesn’t happen right away. Meanwhile, in Qatar even just possessing drugs will put you in jail for a long time while in US only selling drugs will put you in jail for most time. As for sending people to rehab, that is better than jail and a system Qatar also doesn’t have.

No question the US has issues. However, we have come a long way thanks to the activism of people like Cesar Chavez and also have actual institutions like the National Labor Relations Board, the National Labor Relations Act, OSHA, and an independent judicial system where even illegal immigrants can sue employers which Qatar and other gulf counties don’t have yet.

Given that Republicans have a razor thin majority they will struggle to do anything because any single faction of the GOP House can and will torpedo the first thing that they don't like. The Freedom Caucus is going to be a rock around the neck of the House GOP because they absolutely will not give even a single inch if it means giving any other faction within the party a win.

This is to say nothing of the fact that the House will have scheduled and unscheduled departures on the Republican side due to retirements, death, and indictments. The first departure is going to cause utter chaos within the Republican party.

In short, the next two years of infighting that is likely to come from the House GOP is going to make Keeping Up with the Kardashians look restrained and comparatively drama free.

In my entire lifetime I don’t know that we have seen disunity like this from the GOP. So used to them bootstrapping together, right over the rights of minorities. Watching these clowns and closet cases attack each other for once is like a vacation.
Did you visit outside the rich cities? Most places are like hellholes, poor, isolated and full of garbage and misery. Many are unemployed, addicts and/or have HIV. The rest are alcoholics that get hammered every day with cheap russian vodka. There is no future for anyone. A total misery of a country. The wealth is concentrated around moscow and st.petes.
Putin lies about everything. I would not trust his surrender agreement. The best move is exactly what is being done - support Ukraine in all ways possible, ignore Lavrov as a meaningless slob of a blithering human, wait for Putin to die, and take a piss on his grave.

Exactly, there is no point in listening to anything Russia is saying, whether it's about what they have done, what they are doing, or what they will do.

Is apologizing for white supremacists your full time job? Or only when they are democrats. He spent 53 years in congress opposing all civil rights legislation and changed his tune at the age of 88.
Not here for whataboutism, i think these are both appalling acts that deserve political cancellation, but just pointing out hypocrisy. But remember when Joe Biden gave a eulogy for a grand wizard of the KKK then the democrats closed ranks to nominate him for president?

“Twitter poisoned” people act like bratty 10 year olds in an online game. Musk just spent two weeks being a juvenile in public, opening Twitter up to all kinds of damage (legal and technical). They couldn’t stop the Chinese government from spamming the coverage of the protests, and he is bragging that sign ups are at an all time high. It’s bots, moron.

This country is leading the world in science, all of this scientific progress — especially recognition of the diversity of human sexuality — is threatening to conservative Christians in the country’s south generally and rural areas who feel left behind. The very existence of SOGI minorities is a threat to biblical doctrine that puts man and woman at the center of creation.

Why would India deliver weapons to Russia? India was never going to go against Russia since 70% of our army is dependant on them and we have 2 neighbours with whom we don't have the best of relations, add the fact that it has been Russia who has helped with their veto on many matters. If you think this is something new, it has always been our position aka let's try and accommodate them, you are talking about Ukraine war indian trade with Pakistan only stopped when Pakistan stopped it (post removal of 370) and this is a country which had killed many of our citizens and despite what many fans of our current government might think even after pathankot we were trading.

My prediction how this will play out: India stays neutral -> news about Indian balloons surface -> news about India delivering weapons to Russia -> India sanctioned /s.
It's a moot point though isn't it? If the Russian missiles were not fired at Ukraine then this would not have happened.
So while we obviously don't have a case for article 5, the moral blame for the two Polish deaths (and the terror that it's brought to eastern Poland) is squarely on the doorstep of the Russian federation.

but there are countless other media reporting that there is some speculation from Poland that it was a Russian missle, but even more other nations that are leaning towards it was an Ukrainian missle that was trying to shoot down a russian missle.

It's just anger porn to rile up the idiot base. They of course don't know why they hate Fauci, beyond some loose feeling that he is responsible for the difficulties they experienced during the pandemic. "The pandemic sucked, and somebody must be blamed.".

Girl Meets World isn't great, but the episodes with guest stars from the original show are always pretty good (and the Christmas special was pretty good). Eric shows up a few times. My favorite though was the series finale when both Morgans show up.

He graduated from Stanford with a degree in Policial Science. He also interned for Sen. Arlen Specter. It's not much but it's still more qualification than some House members.

Honestly we need to start over completely. We need to turn them into housing centers with education, job training, mental health and drug rehabilitation. Our system is only punishment and has nothing to do with rehabilitation. Which is why we have insanely high recidivism rates.

>This survey of 1,352 adults was conducted February 13th through February 16th, 2023 by the Marist Poll sponsored in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour. Adults 18 years of age and older residing in the United States were contacted through a multi-mode design: By phone using live interviewers, by text, or online. The sampling frames include RDD plus listed landline, RDD cell phone sample plus cell phone sample based on billing address to account for inward and outward mobility, and aggregated online research panels. Survey questions were available in English or Spanish. Phone and online samples were selected to ensure that each region was represented in proportion to its adult population. The samples were then combined and balanced to reflect the 2020 American Community Survey 5-year estimates for age, gender, income, race, and region. Results are statistically significant within ±3.3 percentage points. There are 1,210 registered voters. The results for this subset are statistically significant within ±3.5 percentage points. There are 570 Democrats and Democratic leaning independents and 461 Republicans and Republican leaning independents. The results for these subsets are statistically significant within ±5.1 percentage points and ±5.7 percentage points, respectively. Tables include results for subgroups to only display crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. It should be noted that although you may not see results listed for a certain group, it does not mean interviews were not completed with those individuals. It simply means the sample size is too small to report. The error margin was adjusted for sample weights and increases for cross-tabulations.

Ummm not sure you know how this works, but as far as polls go, that is actually is a great sample size .Anything with a 3+- margin of error is very accurate of the popular opinion.

Pros: actually done a competent job in IL including his handling of the pandemic. Pro labor, pro women’s healthcare, and pro weed with actual laws and amendments passed to back those positions up. He also helped IL take steps towards fiscal solvency with improved credit ratings and reduced deficits.

It is phenomenal that, even though the French have life expectancies 4 years longer that the US, they are ready to remove their president for suggesting raising their retirement age from 62 to 64, and these bozos think we would consider 69 to be a reasonable retirement age.
Yeah. Not to mention the vast majority of the military-industrial complex's corruption is out in the open. I mean, in the United States it's legal for transnational corporations to give money directly to elected officials for political purposes, as long as everybody files the right paperwork with the FEC. And egregious criminal behaviour often does get prosecuted. I don't see a strong argument that the US government is any softer on corruption at Lockheed or General Dynamics than they are on the big Wall Street banks or any other major industry in the US that's rolling in easy money.
That's more than the total since 2014, the United States has committed more than $21 billion [1] in security assistance to Ukraine - if passed brings to $58.7 Billion.

Half of Russia’s OFFICIALLY CLAIMED military budget. I’m sure the total that actually goes towards military equipment and maintenance is a lot smaller once you account for the bribes and grifts along the way.

In any case, nobody's disputing that other countries have corruption. But pretending that corruption in the West is anything like the kind of corruption you have in a country where all semblance of rule of law has broken down is like comparing a vacuum cleaner to the vacuum of outer space. Similar in concept, different in nature.

Also, it is a zero sum game, so hypocritical actions do not bother them, cheating through voter suppression efforts and gerrymandering does not effect them, it is a means to an end, and that end is the ultimate goal no matter what it takes. Once you embrace that, you understand there are no lines you cannot cross for the perceived “greater good”.

It's not hypocrisy to them: they see themselves as the in-group that doesn't have to follow the rules, but everyone else does have to. The less they like the group of others (that are outside their group), the more that group should be held to the rules that they themselves can ignore. To them, there is no inconsistency to that.

To be fair, Christianity is the religion that advertises that you that you can commit all the sin you want and then just ask for forgiveness and it's even with God. Why wouldn't they think they can do whatever they want then with laws.

Hell, if I remember correctly there was another investigation or study very similar after 2016 trying to prove Trump won the popular vote and that one disappeared into thin air as well. A lot of hype in the beginning to get his base all worked up and it went nowhere because they couldn’t prove anything. But when it comes to his base facts aren’t ever the point and never really required.

I think there are many reasons why things like this get overlooked or forgotten. But for one thing cable news is more about making money than it was during the old broadcast news days when they were required to get a license from the government. Back thenBroadcast News was looked on and treated as a public service. It cost them money to report the news, and they actually lost money doing so. Back then they paid for investigative field reporters, now you see talking heads doing no more than sitting at the desk. Most investigative reporting occurs from other sources and they just serve as commentators.

>Honestly, we are a little confused you are taking this so poorly. This is like electing a bunch of clowns to office and being disappointed when they put on a magnificent clown show for you. Here is precisely the clown show you ordered! You shouldn’t be ashamed. You should be applauding. It is like ordering a decorative salad made entirely from Legos and being mad that you can’t eat it. It is like voting for Lauren Boebert and then becoming upset that a legislature that contains her is not productively working for the American people.

This seems like one of the better outcomes of a GOP majority. What’s the hurry to get a speaker in place? WTF is a GOP speaker going to even do?? They may as well just embarrass themselves for as long as possible while nothing gets done because the alternative is endless Hunter-Ghazi hearings and also nothing getting done.

Literally no other nation in the world has the meaningful capability to attack the USA in a way that matters. It is not a thing you need to worry about.

Either way nothing gets done. Fuck em. Let them vote for another 2 years. I like hearing Al Greene from Texas be a weirdo.

“Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth. “Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father.” So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father.” So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.” Gen. 19:31-35 I mean, I guess date raping your own father is pretty fucking cool with a lot of them anyway... probably some weird fantasy they have.
Oh wait, no they won’t go after any of that because this witch hunt is driven by homophobia and discriminating against a minority group so their stupid hateful voting base will keep voting for them.
Let me help out this 'newspaperadditional' person, all of Chinese tech from their tanks to their fighter aircraft came from training PLA engineers to copy and replicate the Russian military tech. The nuclear warheads China has developed and built were designed and taught by Russian-z nuclear engineers. The first carrier ship that china has was a repurposed old Russian naval carrier given the PLA for them to retrofit. When both the Russia-z empire and the Chinese CCP led their PRC when it came to famine and food destabilization both shared and traded hard resources in oil, coal, and fuel, for food supplies to help Chinese citizens survive famines over the past 60 years. in the past 30 years, the Russian-z empire and China in 2006, in 2020, 2016 and now 2020, about 3 years back and even the past 20 years have conducted joint ground military operations together to simulate larger warfare joint military maneuvers for eventual warfare..... the CCP lead PRC has their PLA naval forces run joint naval exercises. They are and have been close allies for the past 60+ years .............
The ANC is corrupt as fuck and can’t get less corrupt due to everybody in the power structure needing to put their hands in the cookie jar.
Pretty much. "Patriotic Education" is just a code word for far-right indoctrination. You can already see this happening in red states. Books about LGBT issues are being pulled out of libraries, lessons about civil rights, diversity, and inclusion are being pulled from the curriculum, and school staff are being forced out so that their positions will be filled by far-right ideologues. They're trying to hold onto power forever by molding Generation Alpha into the most conservative, religious, and bigoted generation yet, and they are currently winning.
"Anti-woke" now stands in pretty clearly for white supremacy and segregation. The good ol' boys are comfortable with the term and it's not self-explanatory so they can use it freely. Rather than constantly denying what they are, they can just misuse "woke" (which in its original usage meant for Black Americans to be careful around white supremacists and segregationists). This article describes the kind of activities they will be engaging in to take the country back to the days when they had all the power.

“Donald Trump’s tax returns exemplify the shortcomings of our tax code,” Wyden said Wednesday. “These are issues much bigger than Donald Trump. Trump’s returns likely look similar to those of many other wealthy tax cheats—hundreds of partnership interests, highly-questionable deductions, and debts that can be shifted around to wipe out tax liabilities.”.

Are you telling me that the whole “it’s still under audit…for 6 years” thing was some sort of lie, and a lie that multiple people tried to cover it up?? That’s crazy talk!
Generally people don’t go AWOL in an active war zone for obvious reasons. When your stateside in garrison it’s no different than a normal job nobody monitors your movements unless you’ve given them reason too. They just leave and don’t show up for duty. If you refuse your right they won’t put a gun to your head, we used to half heartedly say what are you going to do send me to Iraq. But I have put belly chains on guys and brought them to a military prison. The truth is you will be jailed and get real familiar with making big rocks into little rocks hard labor sentences are real and that’s how you will spend the remainder of your contract plus whatever sentence they deem appropriate they just extend you till your release date. You are still subject to the UCMJ and now have a federal conviction on your record. And most if not all your benefits are gone as you were not honorably discharged. Very few good employers will touch you with a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge following you around. I’m sure there’s more but I wasn’t an MP so I just transferred them into custody. If you really lucky and the just want to be rid of you they will just article you and give you the boot.
Navy times says he was listed as a deserter which fits for the duration of his absence. As you can see from the first link, both of those are potential charges for an unauthorized absence but desertion is also a listing for status.

They don’t even actively chase you down for the most part even during the war in Iraq we would get a few awol soldiers here in there back to the unit they always were stopped for something unrelated its basically a bench warrant. They were Articled sometimes jailed and then quickly out processed with a dishonorable or OTH after completing the disciplinary actions.
When I was in high school I had the chance to go to DC to meet my state senators, and was super disappointed that both Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow couldn't make the time to see us even though the organization through which we went had advertised that as a key thing. Instead, they sent someone to speak to us who might have struck me as the most boring, lab-grown policy wonk to ever exist. I figured he'd just disappear into the aether of political history, and no one would ever know who he was.

Only could read the first paragraph ( paywall) but the brown woman in the photo seems to be the election denier. So probably not the best article to pivot to gender/race for no real reason.

There’s a good chance Trump wants to distance himself from that specific movement. It didn’t work out so far and is probably a bad investment into his 2024 run.

Still pretty crazy that people are so into the election claims that they value that over Trump’s actual pick.

This makes sense. The only reason Trump became an election-denier was because it was HIS election and it was a psychological defense mechanism to protect his fragile ego.

their thing is denialism, not trumpism. refusing the evidence at the end of their noses. fantasy land. Typically any white man with the potential to grab pussy (which means they are cisgender) will do. But women and minorities seem to be on the move within it, which is the weirdest thing to see. Maybe it's a grab for wider appeal by burying the misogynistic parts of Trump's legacy?

I don’t know how you get people who don’t want to think about racial inequality to do so. But if bringing it up every opportunity on the internet even when its not quite relevant was ever going to work it the problem would be solved by now.

Well, if they are cooplp with power outages, cold winters, hot summers, and high prices, let them have it. If they cry for federal dollars, tell them to bootstrap it and remember their Texas values: small mind, small government, big trucks, big oil. I'm sure the hate in their hearts can keep them warm.

"The bombings are a departure from the lower tech, more lone wolf-style attacks with which Israel has grappled in more recent years. Since last spring, a string of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings have put Israel on high alert. In response, the Israeli military has conducted near-nightly raids, especially around the West Bank city of Jenin, from where a number of assailants have originated.".

Threads like this give me further hope tho that the diplomatic situation of Israel isn't so one-sided, and people are aware that Israel needs and wants a humanitarian solution to this, not a violent one, but will defend itself if needed.

Palestinian terrorist organizations that do terrorist attacks while governing Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority that encourages and funds terrorists would have tremendous power to stop the conflict and similar attacks. Regardless of military/economic power differential, Israel can't unilaterally create peace.

Dems have 212 so if 6 republicans have the sense to not let the country default and vote with Dems, the debt ceiling goes to the senate. The senate is majority dem (51) and the debt ceiling increase would pass, no? This is all posturing as usual?

If we're lucky, the Biden administration will do something that simply nips this nonsense in the bud and prevents a next time. Platinum coin or simply an executive order to ignore the law. Whatever. The US is bound by the constitution to pay its debts. The constitution and this obligation rather clearly supersedes any law or right of Congress to continue to play these utterly stupid games.

Utah has a long long way to go but lawmakers in a state that deep red opening a dialogue with the LGBTQ community and trying to find workable solutions that do less harm is a rare, though admittedly small, positive step.

I wonder how many will be attributed to the real cause. I don't see anything being done right in Utah. Right down to their conversion therapy law. I'm a victim. It is torture. I've had several surgeries to repair the damage and I've got a lot of scars.

That's bullshit, though. They've done irrevocable harm to trans kids by preventing them from receiving the medical care they need. If they gave a fuck about a dialogue with the LGBTQ community, they would have consulted them first before ever embarking on legislation like that.

Translation-Your ability to scam Trumphumpers, regressives and everyone in between is beneficial to the “party”. Combine that with the fact that you are a proud disciple of the GQP holy trinity- Power, greed and twitter troll fame, plus you know where all the bodies are buried. Besides it would take time we don’t have to train another useful idiot, sorry Mike Pillow.

You think DeSantis is a non-starter for voters? Trump is for sure, and the primaries will be a bruising affair for any other GOP Presidential hopefuls, but I wouldn't count out suburban white women swinging a vote for DeSantis. I think GOP leadership is trying to thread the needle between keeping the crazy fringe on board, while trying to reclaim the "kitchen table" crime, economy, family knows best contingency of suburban voters... and all it takes is low Dem turnout to have them go from the cliffs edge to the seat of power. Makes me nervous, but maybe I'm being pessimistic.

Crazy part is, it'll work. The senate map is likely to really hurt Dems in '24, and if someone like DeSantis can emerge from primaries I have serious doubts the American people will realize how dangerous he is. They all get to keep positions despite being terrible at their jobs and not even putting a party platform together in '20 or '22, but the combination of American mouth-breathers, and our fetish for minority rule will be our undoing.

According to Indiana Rep. Jim Banks "All of the statistics and polling coming out of the 2020 election show that Donald Trump did better with those voters across the board than any Republican has in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan,"... now Banks could be full of shit, I don't intend to dig into those "statistics" but I do see the non-union "working class" vote being a largely GOP monolith. Since the Tea Party, the GOP voting block of "White - Male - Non College" has grown more than any other.

Again, I may be pessimistic, but I think any shift in the "White - Female - College degree" vote to the right, and a less than spectacular Dem turnout... say if people have a hard time getting jazzed about an 82yr old running... puts someone like DeSantis in the oval.

It's harsh, but he's not wrong. Russian athletes, whether willingly or not, propogate russian culture globally. Banning their athletes serves only to increase pressure on the russian leadership and bring home the consequences of its military action in Ukraine.
He had Russian teammates in the past. Who he won championships with. I dont think he means to offend.... but like you said...more pressure is needed.

Also we dont know if these players actually have any immediate family left behind. Most have homes or 2nd homes in North America/Europe. I doubt they will go back to Russia anytime soon. If they have relatives, like a cousin living in Russia... I doubt they will be touched/due to a protestor from overseas.

There are consequences for them talking out. It's not like I want them put in a dangerous spot or anything. But Russia should not have normalised international relations after invading Ukraine. They should be isolated.

When the IRS audits a taxpayer, they mail an official notice to the taxpayer stating that they are under audit.

trump never showed any of those official notices from the IRS that would have proved he was under audit. The only reason not to show one would be that he didn't have one.

Correct. The Dems, not being idiots, knew that the IRS is requires by their own regs to conduct a mandatory audit of POTUS’s taxes, so once Trump had completed his first year they asked Treasury: “Hey, are you actually auditing Trump’s taxes like you are required to do?” and when they didn’t get a response, they used that as the basis for their lawsuit and it turns out that was the reason why they got access to his taxes. Another own goal by Trump.

They didn’t do them for the first two fucking years and didn’t start doing them until a Democrat took over the House Ways and Means Committee and asked where they were.
One of Ukraine's strategies this whole conflict has been to make Russia pay for every bit of ground taken. Attacking traditionally spends many more resources than defending. Last I saw, Bakhmut was pretty much leveled, so I doubt Ukraine is holding it just to hold it. This is what the north looked like right before Ukraine's main counter-offensive took back a huge chunk of land.
I don't know, but i'm sure Ukraine must have some kind of plan because this battle has been almost as costly for them as it has the Russians in terms of men lost.

I called it a strategy because it doesn't happen this way in all conflicts by a long shot. It was a simple statement, but there is more behind it. It isn't just that they are making them pay, they are slowly conceding ground while Russia pushes forward into their defensive lines.

It is a zero sum game, every soldier lost is a win for the other side. So it seems likely that one side is coming out on top, by God's metric one side is doing the smart thing by continuing fighting.

Am I wrong, or isn't it also the case that there's little actual strategic value to Bakhmut for either side? They're just fighting over kilometers basically...

"Trusted" seems like kind of a strong word. In terms of policy maybe, but in terms of politics I don't trust the UAE as far as I can throw them and I doubt our elected officials trust them much more.
There was a line from the amazing book about Exxon by Steve Coll, said by and about oil billionaires in the M. East, something like, “From camels to private jets, but to camels we will return.” They know that the era of oil will come to an end. Will be interesting to see how they pivot. Might not matter at that point — we’re all fucked.

Dubai is a city I can’t wait to see fall. “The foolish man built his house on the sand.” Well they built a whole goddamn city on the sand, and then poured a shitton of sand into the water and built more.

For my part I'd just like to see Saudi Arabia get their shit together and join the modern world, ostentatiousness bothers me less than beheadings, y'know? Dubai can be the biggest and most prosperous city on earth for all I care - if it meant the UAE embraced civil rights and liberties, which they haven't.

Dubai is a city built on slavery and the death of slaves. If anything its helped the UAE regress further into a corrupt hellhole.

I hope the ground opens up and swallows that city hole. That would help the UAE embrace civil rights: Removing all the rich people who don't believe in them.

I agree with you entirely and still think Dubai will become a literal metaphor for how opulence will be their downfall. Glasshouses for US and all that, but it’s still striking just how terrible in design that city theoretically is, yet all we see or hear about is the success of it. Feels forced.
Short answer: no, neither in the short nor long term. Not unless, by some miracle, the owner country agrees to it (and even then).
EU already admitted they can't just seize the state-owned assets and use them as they see fit, because even by the current, ahem, flexible legal standards, it would be stealing. The only thing they did cook up so far is forcibly investing the money in question, give the interest rate to Ukraine and return the rest.

With private assets, it's slightly easier to do, but here another problem arises. The moment USA/EU state out loud they can seize anything belonging to a citizen of nation they don't like, no sane person from South America, Asia and Africa (from anywhere, really) will ever store all of their fortune in a NATO country again, and over time, neither will their countries. Simply because a precedent has been set.

I feel like the US has definitely seized state owned assets before. I mean what about Afghanistan? They straight up woke give back their money and yet people from around the world continue to invest their money there.

Countries invest in the U.S./Europe for stability, not how they play hide the taco in how nationalization of assets happens EVERYWHERE in the world.

In other words, seizing and selling it all is possible, and you can't imagine a greater Christmas gift for China, which will then become a very, very attractive alternative with the slogan "at least WE will not confiscate everything from you illegally".

This is one of the reasons it's so attractive for Chinese citizens to get their money out of China and into international real estate. Away from the grubby CCp hands.

IIRC getting money out of anywhere is a challenge. At least it was the last time I asked; the more shady your income is, which is not uncommon, the harder it will be to take it out of whatever country you choose. Nobody likes losing investments.

Personally I don’t think it will come to that, specifically because it’s impossible to assess the risk and it’s likely not worth the losses.

Reparations are, by definition, agreed on by two sides, and paid after the fighting stops, by the side that agreed to do so (usually losing one).

No points for guessing if there will be a special paragraph of refusal of any reparations and compensations in any peace agreement other than unconditional surrender.

Even the logic of “but China can confiscate assets too!” is not guaranteed to work, because the answer to that will be “and if everyone does it now, why not try to accept these new conditions?”. As many have noted, the other side doing something does not mean a free pass on doing the same.

Maybe part of it will be (only one way to find out). Problem is, Ukraine already has more debts than it can realistically pay back in foreseeable future. And “hey, we loaned your money to someone else” is not really a legally valid excuse for EU to not pay them back.

Maybe, it is very hard to predict the results of something this unusual. It’s called a black swan: easy to explain retroactively, but impossible to foresee.

Trick is, the way of thought of countries that do not align with the West is MUCH different from what the media portrays. Of 8 billion people, only about 1.2 billion total participate in trying to punish Russia at all costs (and even there, it’s hard to say how many are doing it against their will, even if one puts aside Hungary and eastern Germany). In the eyes of others, seizing these assets will be a far bigger thing than it seems, and will not be justified. It’s unlikely to collapse the entirety of the financial habits overnight, but it will inevitably prompt a lot of investors to diversify, and that’s where Asia will come out. It will be terminally stupid for them not to offer something of opportunity.

What is much more likely (and some say already attempted) is trying to file lawsuits against Russia, and use these frozen assets as compensation for damages the lawful way. But that’s not something that can be done quickly, and very likely will not happen before the conflict is resolved (one way or the other). And by the time that happens... Who’s to say what the situation will be like.
Any mention of his name from the officials means a lot for us. The islamic republic is a coward, meaning that if UN just like how they kicked them out of the women council, speak about the executions, they will be paralyzed and it would be a great chance for us to overthrow them. Yes, they would not be involved directly, but indirectly. Any truth spoken about this revolution and this executions will weaken the islamic republic.
but all those karma whores out there want to profit off this protestor's death. They can't win the internet if they dont pretend they're doing something instead of actually contributing like phoning/messaging political representatives and demanding action against Iran.

If many, like many people retweet or share this information, most likely the UN or western governments would step up and stop the execution. You all live in a free speech world and it would be super helpful for us Iranians to overthrow this dictatorship. By emailing this to your government, retweeting this crime, sharing it with your family during the holidays and etc, you can save our lives.

If example needed, Mahsa Amini when killed, was retweeted millions and millions times. The مهسا_امینی became one of the most retweeted hashtag in the history, everyone spoke about her and now, her name is a code in Iran, just like she wanted (Written on her grave “Mahsa, your name will become a symbol”.).

Game Devs ought to have unions, their job requirements are not necessarily the sort of thing that even a well meaning CEO can anticipate. Consider the story from a few years ago about the Mortal Kombat team that needed mental health coverage after years of looking at thousands of photographs of gore and human dismemberment - so that they could create photo realistic graphical effects of gore and human dismemberment.

As gamers we all know about crunch, but there's a lot more that goes into our games that most of us never think about, that a CEO who's tasked with profit and loss statements would need to be told about, and that's exactly what unions are for, they're there to say "These are the things your workers need in order to be healthy and produce their best possible work.".

Yeah, you're probably right. I participated in a couple of different newsgroups and some incels literally destroyed them.
I think another reason might be that ISPs stopped supporting them. I had temporarilly cancelled my internet when I moved across town. A month or so later, I reactivated my service. I couldn't connect with the NNTP server so I called CS. The guy I talked to literally did not know what I was talking about. He claimed to not know what Usenet or an NNTP server were. I mentioned newsgroups and he insisted that I could read news on multiple sites such as CNN. At that point I gave up. I just read that I can access them, but am unwilling to pay for another subscription. The ones I have bleed me enough as it is.

But normal Usenet, that you and I probably grew up with, is very much alive and well. We just probably don’t get access as part of our ISP bill every month. Instead, I pay $5-$9 every few years because buying 1TB for a couple bucks lasts forever unless one is pirating massive amounts of media or something. Just reading and engaging with groups lasts for a really long time.

There are also, uh, other uses for Usenet where even paying for a subscription access would make sense for some people.

Usenet access can be had for very little money. For the curious, check out block providers who sell in GB chunks (or more) rather than subscriptions.

What companies sell blocks of data? I'm not into pirating these days and I'm not sure I can get anything there that I can't get from Reddit. But I'd be willing to 'risk' a few bucks to explore.

I use usenet so still exists, as does IRC. Neither are really for discussion anymore and certainly would be difficult to frame quotes from, particularly with limited life of messages.

What journalists always get wrong about Twitter is when they say the stream order depends on an algorithm. Certainly that is now the default stream order, but it's always been possible to use the original (and best, in my experience) reverse chronological order. I would argue that the process of imitating Facebook features like the weird reordering of the timeline has caused the atmosphere of Twitter to deteriorate.

Having said that, I stopped using Twitter ages ago. Mastodon is pretty good. Bizarrely, Trump's Truth.Social is technically a Mastodon instance, though I imagine it makes little use of the federated features.
There is this thing called history. Territorial boundaries are easy, but cultural boundaries are not. Lots of places in Europe have cultures that overlap territorial boundaries. The Crimea and Ukraine are just one.
The majority are unlikely to be illegal occupants, but culturally they made identify and side with Russia. When the Ukraine left the Soviet Union they were likely considered countrymen, but now they may not be and may be considered a threat.

In Czechia for example, many of the Germany speaking Czechs migrated to Austria then eventually to the US. While Austria was a more hospitable place, the drums of war and lack of opportunity pushed them out.

We just have to be more aware of cultural boundaries and make accommodations for differing cultures within territorial boundaries. We do that and we can end a lot of unnecessary war.

No need to apologize. The real problem is gonna be those families that were there before invasion that ended up getting Russian/separatist citizenship and decide to stay when Ukrainian government takes back all of Ukraine.

Ukraine has several areas where the land was occupied by people that identified as Russian and use Russian as their primary language. It's been that way for hundreds of years. That isn't a justification for invasion by Putin nor annexation.

Of all the GOP losses this past election and the red wave being a red drip, Kari Lake losing has been my favorite. Watching her lose her shit has been pretty entertaining.

That’s fair but I’m just tired of these conspiracy nut job. They like to throw out lots of accusations but are sparse on evidence and facts then have the nerve to act like they’re smarter than everyone else. Like I said, it’s exhausting, they’re exhausting.

Lol. Trump submitted over 50 lawsuits to multiple courts with no evidence. Many of which were closed with prejudice.

But, i still disagree that they'd want him as a speaker, he couldn't even deal with press conferences when he was president, and stopped giving them, and that's pretty much the main purpose of a speaker.

This may seem like a political game to them but it’s been hard to sit back and watch this rhetoric happen. It divided us, and it caused us harm. He should not get out of this by announcing it now.

Meaning the whole gop party system need to overhaul for the sake of the people. They conservatism went to far. It's not center right anymore, with threats, riots and propaganda. For the first time they realized they see how big the American wound is. The only issue is: why does it take so long for them to realized they went too far?

These type of politicians won't stop this type of juggernauts of politics until stuff like this happens. Republicans have turned on their blind eye toward their citizens since Reagan era. They need a wakeup nightmare call like this to realized their errors. I'm sure as heck that DeSantis, Abbott, Pelosi's attackers going to tread their words and action after this.
And the 24hr news cycle just keeps changing the subject. And what events that should outrage the everyday American into getting real change just moves and shifts into something social/subjective. If tomorrow there were a vote to give some big industry the ability to capitalize off the American voter they would take that vote at the end of the day and by morning there will just be some new email that comes out about someone’s son/daughter about some risqué subject matter. There’s nothing that’s going to change what’s gonna happen, the democrats get the benefit of fighting the good fight to help the millions of Americans with federal student loans but without any teeth to actually get the job done. And the republicans get to fight the democrats for the benefit of showing their supporters that somehow giving the everyday American a break is different than bailing out companies and industries that over inflate their product/service or stock price and when their economic schemes don’t pan out they dip their hands into our pockets. If the scheme does work, they keep the revenue and get to set the price point as high as they want on their products or stocks. But when it doesn’t work, despite being called out for shady business tactics, they still get their puppets to vote for a bail out. But don’t worry, you can’t get your student loans busted down by a fraction because that’s socialism and this country was built on “pulling yourself up by the bootstraps” and yada yada yada. I’m guessing they’ll propose some instrument they will force feed the people as some “healthier alternative” that is better fit for themselves and not anyone looking for help. It’s like where Trump gave everyone $100 extra each month with his tax cuts and nobody showing the real benefit went to the ones that already have more than they’ll ever need. There’s a reason more billionaires have been created in the past two decades and the American middle class still can’t afford a home. Don’t worry why would you want to have more buying power and a possible goal of retiring instead of complete reliance on the countless representatives of a government that just wants you to hate your neighbor and fight over the next hot topic with no impact on what’s in your leased apartment/home.

Jesus was mainly a philosoper, and his teaching were mostly related to personal lifestyle (and arguably don't lead to a functioning society if taken literally).Christian norms are general (give everything to the poor, renounce to violence, love your friends and enemies, don't betray your partner), and you're not really supposed to always follow them: everyone is a sinner, everyone can be forgiven.Of course, absolutely evil things were done in the name of Christianity (because the bible is a contradictory and somewhat vague book and you really can interpret it any way you want with enough mental gymnastics) , but nowadays being a "moderate christian" living your faith on a personal level in a secular society is easy, because that's in line with the original spirit of the founder.On the other hand Muhammad was a succesful ruler and conqueror, his norms and rewards are far more precise and quantifiable (Give x fraction of your wealth to the poor, pray x times a day, go to place x once in a lifetime, you can have up to x wives, you will get x virgins in heaven) and actually define a functional model of society.
It may sound disgusting and sick, but stoicism and dignity in the face of death may sound preferable, but it only hides the true horror and Hell of those executions. It allows the killers a chance to feel some level of dignity and assurance that what they do isn't that bad. They're not the monsters, they're not the bad guys.

These "the gubmint gonna track ya!" folks seem to be technologically stuck in the 1920s or something, because the government has about 100 ways to track all of us at any given time, most of which the average American has no awareness of. Hell, just look at the hundreds of people who were caught after Jan. 6th. Their phones were just hemorrhaging breadcrumbs that whole time and they never even thought to get rid of them.
Zelenskyy himself is Jewish, Ukraine has an enormous Jewish Diaspora that dates back thousands of years, Israel's mortal enemy - Iran - is actively equipping the Russian Invaders...
Every sensible reason would point towards Israel embracing using their formidable Military Industrial Complex for such valiant a cause as this geopolitical David vs. Goliath.

Israel doesn't want to alienate Russia because Russia allows them to bomb Iranian weapons caches in Syria that are destined for Hamas. Russia also helps ensure that Iranian troops in Syria stay away from the Israeli border.

From Israel's perspective, preventing a a terrorist group that is actively attacking them from acquiring more weapons and preventing their main enemy from staging an invasion force on their border under the cover of fighting Syrian rebel groups are immediate national security concerns. Israel is worried about the development of the Iranian arms industry, especially Iran's nuclear program. However, their current strategy, is to engage in targeted bombing of infrastructure and the assassination of scientists and engineers critical to the Iranian arms industry and weapons development programs. I will grant you that this strategy is proving to be an obstacle, but not an existential threat, to the growth of Iranian arms industry.

Also the fact that Russia has a reasonable large Jewish population and ties with Israel. I'm not saying I don't think Israel should not help more, but there are definitely well documents reasons they want to be an intermediary between both sides. I think people don't realise how complicated international politics actually is.

I genuinely think a lot of people don't understand how complicated international politics is. There is a lot of reasons why it is in America's interest to have good relations with Israel.

While they are not giving lethal aid at this time if you check the next country down, Italy, a much larger country, Israel has given significantly more humanitarian aid. That does count.

There are some deep negative ties to Ukraine as well. Ukraine has consistently voted against Israel at the UN. I’m not sure if that’s changing lately but that’s how it’s been for years. The fact is that Israel has it’s own serious security threats and their working relationship with Russia could greatly affect that.

Ok, I haven’t looked into that in a long time but my understanding is that the US doesn’t just write Israel a check, they basically give them credits for purchases from US defense contractors. Since Israel is providing only non lethal aid at this time none of that would go to Ukraine.

You do realize that they’d love that, right? Of course you don’t. Because of that aid and the treaty it came with the US exerts a control over their arms and technology exports. You don’t think the IDI can replace that three billion with unrestricted sales? They can. And beyond that we get first dibs on a lot of things they develop. Israel currently does not have enough Iron Dome batteries for themselves but the US has a few. Why did they give any to the US when they don’t have enough for themselves? That aid and the treaty it came with.

What? Israel’s GDP is almost 500 billion. That makes the US aid a little less then one percent of GDP. Do you really think that would break Israel’s bank?

In the UK people always complain about foreign aid like it's just giving money away. It's not, it's a means of buying favour with other countries which often involves them reinvesting a certain amount back with you (say through service contracts or buying weapons from you).

America wouldn't just be giving money to Israel for the fun of it and it would be much more cost. For example it would damage their information gathering capabilities in the middle east.
Where he is wrong is saying "there is no Ukraine "winning" the war". That is blatantly false. Ukraine can regain full control of its resources and land, and that is definitely winning. Selling gas at a discount to the countries that helped that happen isn't losing. Bear in mind, the only reason Ukraine has access to these resources is due to NATO aligned countries helping them in the first place, this is actually a key reason for the conflict. If the west had helped Ukraine bring its natural resources to the market, Russia's position as the sole petro nation in Europe would have been usurped. Since Russia is so dependent on this for their economy, it could have shattered them. But rather than try a carrot to win Ukraine's favor, Russia chose underhanded tactics and then a stick.
This happened to the gf of a friend a few years back, she tried to fart to make fun of guy humour. Mistakes were made and the group got a funny story out of it. Thankfully she was a good sport about it... after a year or so..

Donald Trump saddled Republicans with a clearly flawed Herschel Walker as their Senate nominee in Georgia, but in the final weeks before the runoff election, the ex-president has not spent a single dime to help Walker — despite the nearly $100 million of donor money he is sitting on.

A long time ago I used to fly RC airplanes. Big 5' wingspan scratch built planes. I came across a Russian guy visiting to compete in a control line plane competition (pre RC plane flying). He had this really gorgeous plane that was beautifully crafted with nearly none of the luxuries I had to make my comparably badly built planes.

His materials were far more difficult to work with, but they were fashioned with so much care and his planes were so well aligned.

I had cyanoacrylate adhesive which set in seconds and he used this shitty resin with a long set time. My planes were covered in heat shrinkable mylar film that pulled taut and his were this doped super fine fabric that was so carefully trimmed.

I bought a couple diesel engines for dirt cheap from him, because he wanted dollars to buy some cases of CA glue to take back home. Those engines were incredible. The castings looked like shit: rough flashing edges and a dull finish, but when I took them apart their cylinders and pistons were perfectly honed. The bearings were excellent. They ran really nice and they cold started well.

I do not doubt that they would think of using exhaust heat to warm an airframe to shed ice and keep a battery warm.

Their model airplane community was extremely good at cleverly making excellent planes with far worse resources. I have seen examples of Russian made hand built radio control systems that worked pretty good. I was spoiled by really nice Japanese engines and RC gear, but I sure admired the homebrew Russian stuff I saw.

It sounds like a top secret kind of idea to a glib Redditor, but they have not seen how talented Russians can be at kludging. All it takes is for one of those experienced hobby guys to figured out how much exhaust to bypass into the airframe to keep it warm, but not overheat the skin, and those instructions could be spammed over all of their inventory by meatheads who cut silicone tube and punch holes in it.

He's pushing 70 by now and either he's dead (Russian males have a life expectancy of only 71yrs), or he could have been conscripted I guess.

He wasn't the only smart guy from Russia. He had pictures of his club which showed dozens of guys proudly holding up their planes. I don't imagine that all Russians are blithering idiots. It's simplistic to assume that they can't solve problems. I think that their culture presents some really bad fundamental problems, but dealing with deicing is a fairly minor technical issue compared to the crushing problems of cultural corruption.

The engine exhaust seems to come out of a tube bolted to the cylinder heads. All you do is bolt on a tuned pipe which is a very classic way to improve engine performance, and one that Russia is quite capable of making. The tuned pipe will give you a high pressure region from which you can side tap some exhaust gas to pipe back into the airframe with a flexible silicone tube. It is not uncommon to use silicone tubing to divert engine exhaust away from a RC plane to keep engine goo off of the sides. It is also common practice to side tap gas from an exhaust system to pressurize liquid fuel from a fuel tank into an engine.

You pipe this bypass gas into your airframe which will be hollow (because it has to be light) to keep it warm. You might even run that tube into a perforated towards the leading edge of the wings to heat them the most where ice building is generally the most problematic.

As I see it, combustion powered drones will continue to operate into the winter, much better than fully electric drones. It's much more difficult to route heat from efficient brushless motors into the props which will ice like mad. One could swaddle a Lipo with a hand warmer and some insulation to keep it warm, but rotor icing will still be a problem in the mid soggy cold winter. Maybe a combustion engine can heat an aluminum propeller just enough to shed ice.

Or it could not and it's really easy too. It is dangerous to just conjecture on hope. One needs to think about how things actually work.

None of this is high tech. All sorts of airplanes have deicing features powered by engine heat. I doubt they will have a carburetor icing problem because it's bolted to a small hot engine.

Nearly all of the crap I have described has been common practice in one form or another in either RC planes and small passenger planes since the '80's. None of it is high tech and all of it is obvious if one is skilled in the art of making flying things that fly in winter.

Lol first was Transnistria (1992), then South Ossetia and Abkhazia (2008), then Crimea (2014) tbh. Russia has been in violation of that for years before Ukraine.

They are in violation of the UN Charter which they signed in 1991. It specifically requires ALL nations to never seize and annex territory by force of arms. First Crimea and now the Eastern Provinces of Ukraine, meanwhile bombing clearly civilian targets in Central and Western Ukraine. The UN General Assembly should expell Russia completely, not just from the Security Council, after all the USSR was one of the permanent members not Russia. Russia wasn't even a separate entity of the UN until 1991, whereas Ukraine SSR was a founding charter member of the UN and merely changed its name to Ukraine without the SSR moniker.

Actually in removal of Russia from the Security Council Russia doesn't get a veto vote in the UNSC. If Russia keeps threatening first use of Nuclear weapons, even tactical weapons, they will be removed from the UNSC.
That has happened in the past in state legislatures. A few years back the NY legislature had a similar situation, deadlocked and didn’t have enough people for a quorum to vote, as republicans were staying out of the room because they didn’t want the Democratic majority to take control, but one Republican legislator walked into the chamber to get to the vending machine on the other end, and a Democrat quickly called for a floor vote and it passed, flipping the legislature blue again. The Republican insisted he shouldn’t count as present but it was too late.

I wonder how much of it is boomers retiring. I bet they make up the vast majority of union members because there were so many when they became working age.

Presidents &ndash; or any politicians, really &ndash; shouldn't be visiting disaster sites at all. People in those situations have enough to deal with without having to worry about a presidential visit and all the logistical hassles that come with it.

Because having a President in a disaster area leads to more issues. Its one of the reasons most Presidents don’t immediately visit such areas.

Lastly, the mayor of East Palestine didn’t want Biden there for same reasons I said. He told him not to come. Which he then turned political after Biden visited Ukraine.

Biden offered the governor anything he wanted and he turned it down. Even with that, we still had 4+ agencies on ground investigating and providing help. We are holding Norfolk accountable for cleanup.
I did live in the US, for a number of years. I lived in Newport Beach, CA. I worked in Irvine. Company I worked for transferred me from Vancouver, to Irvine, to Toronto. Yes, I'm Canadian, but we're all North Americans as far as I'm concerned. The 49th parallel has been a virtually unmanned border for as long as I can remember...so please dispense with the "you don't live in the US, bologna." Canada has its issues, too. No doubt about it....but no country on earth is as terror-filled - aside from Israel/Palestine and actual hot war zones - than the USA is presently. My family used to vacation in Florida annually. We stopped in 2019 for fear of the rising trend of violence and insanity, and the nickle & dime-ing we had to put up with by our landlords/rental agencies (and environmental issues like Ft. Myers flooding). There's a large enough contingent of the American population that have become so desperate, they're lashing out in violence on the regular. They see violence as the only solution because they have no leadership...and the few leaders they do quasi look up to, they're all corrupt.
Idiot racists and people who target Asian street gangs. Normal, law abiding people get caught in the middle. We have the same racism problems as the rest of the world, but far more firearms than most. Pretty tragic combination.

I wasn’t aware of that, so thank you. I was however speaking purely on the basis that someone like Pence so far up the chain is typically a sign my assumption might be correct. So who knows, but still typically someone so far up the chain is usually reserved more towards the end of the investigation. Time will tell but I have to imagine he already had a lot more to work with when he started that typically you would not have in most other investigations.

Im sure that's worked out well for them in Russia currently, with many of them being slaughtered for quesitoning their fascist leader and losing all their goods and properties if he couldnt directly attack them. Thats the most recent full swing Fascist takeover.

This is the most visceral and accurate description of this group of people I have ever seen. The distinct lack of empathy has been hard for me to communicate in a way that is readily understood. You nailed it, friend!
Oh man, I have a small anecdote about someone presumably with this condition- I work in medical and we were supposed to do a procedure on someone allergic to "all chemicals" (even though literally everything is a chemical but sure). She flipped out when across the room I used the hand sanitizer from our foam dispenser, coughing and hacking and she took a benadryl and said she felt better after about 5 mins. Idk how long it takes to start working but that seems rather fast. I then proceed to put on ultrasound gel.. which is a chemical. And used an ultrasound probe which, you guessed it, had been cleaned with a rather strong disinfectant as we do between every patient which she had no reaction to. Then when we begin the procedure she has another coughing fit when we sterilize her skin, and this reaction I believe - it was a breast biopsy so obviously putting an antiseptic that close to her face definitely seems more plausible. She took another Benadryl and Xanax and tolerated the rest of the procedure fine. She even let us put bandages over the biopsy site, and adhesives are a fairly common material to be allergic to so you think someone that's allergic to quote "chemicals" would have reacted to that. After her biopsy she went to get a mammogram and, again, the machine had been previously cleaned which she didn't react to. One of our mammo gals asked if she would like her to apply some bactracin antibiotic appointment and her response was "only if you want me to die." Also there was the whole debacle about which numbing agent we were supposed to use before the procedure. She had to reschedule more than once because she believed she was allergic to every one of them. We called a surgeon of hers and found out which one he had previously used - he told us to call it by X name otherwise she would say she was allergic to it.
A friend (NB) of mine in Vancouver has an autoimmune disease, is allergic to just about everything, and has chronic pain. Several DOCTORS have told them to just look into MAID. Basically "save yourself and the system the trouble of dealing with you and go off yourself".
Lmao Xi doesn't give a damn about China or he would have stick to his predecessors' policy of befriending, not antagonizing, the West, which led to the country's most prosperous two decades in the last 300 years.

Lol that foro de Sao Paulo. It doesn't say who signed it besides I'm talking about what you said about all the left in South America supports Russia which is bullshit. Yeah Lula was wrong in some statements but that doesn't affect me. You keep the classic far-right retoric that all leftist governments are pro-russian when it isn't. And why would they support the U.S when we all know the history of them internvining in the continent to place dictators and affecting democracy.
Correction: our gouvernement supports the Oekraïne war and is self hating the own population. Is killing it by tax laws. I myself am paying 53% income tax, 75% tax on energy , 21% on groceries , gas is €2.10 per liter and so on…….
Yet, Russia's GDP is 1.7 trillion and Netherlands' is 1 trillion... and now Russia finds out that those pissed off Dutch can afford a decent amount of weaponry.

You’re right about the 9% vat on groceries, my bad. Income tax is determined on income levels or boxes. The first box income to €68.508 is 37,10% , the second €69.399 is 49.50% . Then there are all kinds of taxes because I drive a company car and so on. So I work the first 4 hours of the day for the government. Yes I’m having a good income……but if you divide this by the hours I make I am not earning much more the the average income per hour. And because I have the funds to invest in solar energie on power and warm water, alternative heating , electric car. I can take advantage of the subsidies provided by the government. This is at cost of the lower incomes but I get some of my payed taxes back.
__A court in Appenzell has dismissed a racism case against a yodeler who painted his face black and pretended to be African, reports the SonntagsZeitung.__.
The case relates to a carnival performance by a yodel choir in November 2022, in which choir head Markus Nef caused controversy by stepping onto the stage with a black painted face, frizzy wig, drum and grass skirt. Nef, a local farmer, denied allegations of racism, saying he had no time for that in a place where people “work and don’t look for trouble”. He said he had never heard the term “blackfacing” before.

However, the Federal Commission against Racism called the performance "clearly tasteless and racist”. The performance and disguise reproduced racist colonial stereotypes where “black people are belittled for general amusement", it said, calling for judicial authorities to investigate a possible criminal offence.

The public prosecutor's office in the northeastern canton Appenzell Outer-Rhodes opened criminal proceedings. However, judges have now ruled that while the performance used "typical elements of blackfacing", the performer did not make racist or derogatory remarks about Africans. They concluded that in the context of the carnival this did not qualify as racism.

Markus Nef doesn’t have to accept it and he’s lucky he lives in one of the whitest places in the world to be able to get away with it and with an excuse like “where people work and don’t go looking for trouble.” But he’s a racist. That’s textbook racism. When people in his country pretend it’s not it just makes them look racist.

The first instance of this proved to be Kremlin-orchestrated. To irritate Turkey (which it did) in order to influence Erdogan on Sweden's acceptance into NATO (which it did).
I think it's very unlikely that Chang Frick paid Paludan's permit it to further a Russian agenda, and I'm saying this as a person who very much dislikes him, his politics and pretty much everything he does. He's just anti-Muslim and anti-Turkey, and possibly racist.

Chang Frick has indeed had ties with Russia and been pro-Russia in the past, but he has been critical of Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and he's is currently supporting Ukraine, at least publicly.

Afaik, Chang suggested that Paludan burned a Turkish flag, not a quran. The quran was Paludan's idea, and that's what he's been doing for years. At least from all I've heard from him when he was active here in Denmark, I'm pretty sure he would've done what he did at some point either way. At most, Chang nudged him to protest it at the right place and time.

This dude has been vocal and actively against Muslims since 2016. He and his "Stram Kurs" folks have done this for years, have travelled around Europe doing the same crap everywhere but it somehow magically didn’t happen(???) because, according to op, the "first instance" had something to do with Sweden wanting to join NATO and and Putin not wanting that.

I think the person claiming something about the first instance of this having anything to do with Sweden getting into NATO is completely out of their mind simply because the first instance of this was years before there was any talk at all about this.

Although Erdogan absolutely knows what this is; he's just gambling on bringing pressure to bear on Sweden in order to get them to extradite Kurdish separatists who were given asylum.

You are so presumptuous, you think an average person today reflects on supply chain issues? If Americans were paying attention to a single thing they wouldn’t be stressing today because they’d ne prepared. The Fed told us in 2019 that inflation was coming, they told us what they were going to do, economists told us what that would translate into - and people did nothing. I was laughing my ass off when I read yesterday that JP Morgan is putting a billion dollars into rental homes,I was like why the fuck didn’t you think of doing that in 2019 when the series of events I just spelled out was laid in front of you. People can’t see past their nose.

I predict that once he formally announces he's gonna have a rough time since the knives from Trumpland will be out. Desantis isn't going to be able to acquit himself well enough on Fox News explaining why whatever Trump is ranting about isn't actually correct. He's currently having the same kind of polling boom that Giuliani and Fred Thompson had in 2007 and Scott Walker had in 2015. The media assumes they're the guy and voters project what they want on to them. Then once they start actually having to campaign and hit the circuit it's underwhelming and everyone realizes they're boring.

Yeah Trump’s tactic is never about standing out or being better but rather tearing down his opponent. Trump won’t gain voters but he may very well kill all enthusiasm for DeSantis.

It certainly looks that way, and we’ve never had someone so blatantly right wing win (Trump had his own dumpster fires but his media issues in 2016 weren’t really about his extreme political ideology yet). But who knows. The republicans love both these guys and they’ll all vote for either of them.

Sure, it is extremely difficult to get permits, but it is everywhere so. You need to own the land. You need to be able to prove ownership. You need to pay taxes on it. You even need to conform to some rules (sometimes, the structure color is defined for you, sometimes even the vegetation in your garden is regulated!), submit plans, wait, resubmit etc etc...

This appears to be an appropriate and sufficient response. Reznikov says there are contracts with 8 suppliers. That doesn't sound like a corrupt system to me.

"Ukraine is corrupt" has been the main Russian propaganda line for like a decade at this point, and this will do nothing but feed the typical rumors about selling weapons on the black market, or ministers squirreling away funds into offshore accounts. It's important to remember that Ukraine isn't Afghanistan or Iraq - even if some percentage of money and support gets skimmed off, it's not going to be a complete theft like in previous wars.

It's not mentioned in the article, but there was another story yesterday about Ukrainian repair contracts for certain vehicles being severely overpriced (e.g., $150k to repair a vehicle worth half that when new). And while yes, war profiteering isn't ideal, at least the vehicles still get repaired and can support Ukraine's fight.

Well it's not just the main Russian propaganda line. It's a big enough issue that Zelenskyy outright set out to tackle it in order to make a bid for NATO. There is corruption, but they're working to improve it.
Horse shit. CEO s are not doing a 400% better job "increasing shareprice" than they were in the 90s, yet that's about how much their pay has increased. In fact, their pay doesn't fluctuate with their performance at all, illustrating the utter nonsense that your comment is. Their pay is clearly kickbacks to buddies, the board members pal around with the CEOs, and they will take as much as they can get away with. This can be regulated, as other countries do, by making and enforcing laws that prevent a CEO from making X times more than the lowest paid employees. Your twisted, disgusting, and thoroughly innacurate take is what prevents that from happening in America. Fuck that ignorant shit.

People give Nancy Pelosi a lot of shit, but she does a massive amount for her home district. Just a month or so ago she had her people set up an hour long phone-in meeting with San Franciscans concerned about the monkey pox. She started the meeting, then she turned it over to a bunch of experts from UCSF and SF Zuckerberg General Hospital, and had them talk to us about the risks of transmission, where we could get vaccines, availability of second doses, etc. There was time at the end for question and answers. I really appreciate everything she does for San Francisco residents.

she's Unendurable, quite frankly, unendurable, which is something I just came up with, nobody's ever even heard of it before, even the Generals were coming up to me, "no one's smarter than you, Sir," I said I know that, because you never had a Smarter President, you look at Obama, he couldn't even take the Presidential Test but I got them all, they said, "no one gets all 35," but I got every single one, even the Bonus, no one gets the Bonus, and Dr. Ronnie, he's your Congressman from the Great State of Texas, I love Texas, and he was your Doctor but now he's there, and he said to me, "Sir, you have a Perfect Body and a Perfect Mental," it's true, I'm like, mentally there, I have a great Cognitive.
If he can't take a little grilling from a Fox Host who doesn't kowtow and actually holds him accountable for the things he says, why is so much of our electorate utterly beholden to him? It's just disgusting.

I think that what people like yourself don’t grasp about being an undermined minority in a capitalist system, like ours, is that such minorities are not responsible, at least not to the same standards as wealthy, white, heterosexual-passing men, for what they have to do to make ends meet, which equates in said system with getting ahead. It’s the luck of the draw for such minorities. So, I think that’s her excuse, which I personally will allow since she has made recent strides in a more ethical direction with her brave testimony. I agree with you, it is a tragic waste of human potential—living within the capitalist death grip, as such.

This is not what US officials are saying at all, people need to stop posting just for headlines and actually read. All the US is saying is they want Zelenskiy to drop his stance of not negotiating with Russia while Putin is alive. That’s it. This is the dem letter all over again.
I’m not sure anyone in Europe is tired of watching Russia flounder and degrade in Ukraine. Most of those politicians and many citizens lived with realities like the iron curtain and the Fulda Gap, knowing NATO forces in Europe could not stop a Russian armored invasion.

I think that the article precise that the US fear that (while they still want to help Ukraine) others countrys might get tired of the war because of the impact it have for them (like in Europe, South America and Africa).

If the world is “fatigued” by some modern hitler starting his very inept campaign and wats to just let him because they “have enough” then this world deserves it, and everything that will come out of this kind of signal we send by this in the future from different fucking bastard individuals and autocratic regimes in the world. Because some privileged, spoilt part of the world is “fatigued”. We deserve to die.

This is exactly what I’m talking about though. The headline makes it seem that the US is officially pushing Ukraine towards negotiations, which is not the case at all. Here’s another quote from the article that directly contradicts what the headline is implying:

Countries in the third world are not in question here and they mostly are “neutrally” pro-Russian or in fact indifferent (which is more than undestandable.

This was about Western world that is actually involved in this war and its attitude is consequential for this conflict. Of course jount world pressure on Russia would be wellcome, of course these countries that trump called “shitholes” are possible fascilitators for subverting sanctions, of course western pressure on Russia would be more effective if third world would be onboard with the west against Russia. But even if they would formally be with us in practice these mostly corrupt and semi- or weak democracies wouldn’t be reliable partners, it an effort lost in advance to get the third world onboard.

It would be important if Europe held on with this war effort that Ukraine is sacrificially fighting for our interest, but particulary that our on-duty saviour, daughter-turned-parent: the USA holds this line and that trumpist republicans do not turn the policy around. Any outcome that would give Putin’s Russia any territory is a reward for the regime, a prolongation of the threat from Russia to the West - European Union, immediate russian neughbourhood that has aspirations to join the democratic world. This failure (in cost of life and resources) has radicalised Russian public even more and any victory they could take out of this would only worsen their mentality towards dangerous in future. The only way is defeating them so they realise they were fcuked by their leader. Their mentality will remain problematic but theere will be a possibility of self-reflection and preocupation with problems within the federation that would have to be resolved would kerp Russia out of our hair. Like the US led strategy (after complete EU, then ECC, failure to address balkan wars) did with Serbian regime.

I get that the conflict impact other countrys but come on, they were attacked in the beginning, it's the second times it happens, they still have a foreign force occupying their country and Russia demends are unacceptable, what should they do ?

My guess is they craft an opinion that allows some check on state courts to intervene but nothing close to the worst case scenario that the NC attorneys are asking for.

You can’t always tease out a justice’s position from oral arguments, but in this case quite a few of them seemed pretty hostile to the argument NC lawyer was making, with only Gorsuch and Alito being full throated in their support of a maximalist idea of the independent state legislature theory. Even Thomas didn’t seem all that enthused.

Even that still isn't a great result. We'd probably end up in 2030 dealing with a bunch of legislatures doing what Ohio did: running out the clock by repeatedly submitting unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps and getting them struck down over and over again until it reaches the point that it's too late for a new map and the election goes ahead with a gerrymandered one.

>One of the ways it does that is by allowing employers to contribute to a worker's retirement fund. Many companies already match 401(k) contributions, but this change would mean that employers can contribute the amount that workers are spending on their student loan payments.

I was talking with some guy who was convinced Trump would beat Biden in a debate if they debated again...fundamentally not realizing that Biden won his one debate with Trump with the voters he needed by being annoyed with Trump. That resonated with everyone who wasn't in Trump's base.

Biden's no nonsense, gets shit done, and just a bit ornery. That appeals to a large cross-section of Americans. It's also why things like "Dark Brandon" got turned into a meme.

It was only ever an excuse to try and get out of the deal if he needed to. It didn't work and his true colors show that he really didn't care about the issue at all. He is manipulative and lies when it is convenient for him to do so. If he actually took the time to check who voted in that poll it is likely mostly bots.

A major electric car manufacturer siding with the party spearheaded by the fossil industry while alienating the party most of his clients belong to because he's scared of paying his income tax? It's a bold strategy Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for him.
Which is ironic as, judging by the archive footage I could find of his time as a sports presenter, he was utterly straight-down-the-line as a presenter, verging on bland with no strong personality.
Granted, you could possibly that down to professionalism or the style that was expected from the type of shows he was doing at the time.

But it probably explains why I don't remember anything in particular about him before the infamous "Wogan" appearance et al. I wasn't into sports as a kid in the 80s, so I wouldn't have been watching that sort of stuff anyway, but I do remember other sports presenters (e.g. Des Lynam, Dickie Davis, etc.) being more "personalities" whereas Icke was someone whose name and face I'd have recognised, but that was about it.

The only thing I can remember about him before Wogan is something with horses, maybe on kids' TV. Icke is in a cart, and the guy that knows about horses is asking him politely, then impatiently, to stop rolling about laughing like a maniac because balance, physics, etc. Then the cart tips over and they fall out.

In 1990 I believe he had a nervous breakdown and thought he was the son of "the godhead" that should only wear turquoise. He went on the UK's biggest talkshow at the time and told everyone his theories and the audience just ridiculed and laughed at him for being crazy (you would hope today that the producers would cut the interview short as his was clearly having mental health issues).

Rather than getting help he doubled down and realised that there was a large enough following of other people having mental health problems who would buy his books/merchandise so why would he get help? He is a finicially a lot richer for not getting treatment, and I think I am right in saying that at least one of his children has followed him into the "family business" but again why wouldn't he? Make claims that can never be proven or disproven and a certain element of society will give you all their money.

Terry Wogan, the host and probably the most mild-mannered and inoffensive person on the planet, actually sounds quite serious when he says "they're laughing at you, not with you". Icke gave an interview on RTE about the same time:

Someone posted an "interview" he did on Hannity a few days ago and of course they had Ted Cruz on one side of him and Lindsay Graham on the other side and I would say all but one question was directed at those two instead of Walker because they know his word salad would just hurt him more.

Lol it’s funny cause Cruz, McConnell and Graham have all appeared on screen with him to protect him from himself, and instead of Walker looking perturbed by having to have handlers at every turn, his handlers look like kidnap victims who are trying to tell the world they need help.

I didn’t understand how truly ridiculous the situation with Cannon was until a lawyer friend of mine explained it to me a few weeks ago. I’m full of antihistamines and cold meds and in an absolute brain fog right now, so I won’t even try to explain what he said, as I’ll mangle it horribly, but yeah…it was egregious. I’m sure there are many lawyers who have posted great explanations online.

This is the result of a systematic degradation of public schooling. The next generation is be told by the first to experience this degradation that book banning is fine and that education is secondary to our precious fee-fees. Their perception of their “rights” are skewed kaleidoscopicly.
its like the modern digital environment, it was intentionally designed in a particular way which feigns personal utility while utilizing you for ulterior motives. The only way through this now, is to start from the ground up and give that springboard for everyone an actual foundation instead of the trap tarp covering clown dunk tanks the GOP ensure our government puts in place of social services. Moving the threshold into personal goldilocks zones of political security is how we are where we are, its not a real structure but a laminate on the damn wrapper of sovereignty so nobody even realizes the tarp is a trap with a specifically designed clownshow under it and nobody stops talking about the next carnie showcase to see what we can do about the fuxking tornado that stole kansas, Dorothy and her little dog too.
I wish I could be there to see it when their mercenary army who they hired to evacuate them to their bunker in New Zealand when shit goes down ends up murdering them because why keep the billionaires around when you have access to all their amenities?
I mean India doesn't offer much rn and is riddled with poverty as well. I live in the US and actual developed countries are generations into the future compared to all of south asia. But The northern areas of Pakistan where Gilgit Baltistan is are some of the richest and developed areas of the country. India would have to become developed to the level of US or western Europe to be able to realistically overcome their patriotism and even then I doubt it. So the only way India is getting that land is by fighting for it and waging an offensive war through the karakoram mountain range, so never. and Kashmiris don't live in this region anyways. In fact even in Azad Kashmir, it's mainly Punjabis/Paharis that live there. So there is no longing by the people to join up with the Kashmir valley, in fact the Gilgit Baltistanis want their own province seperate from the politics of Azad Kashmir and Kashmir valley. So India doesn't offer much to Pakistan in any fashion to concede this territory. India has never controlled this territory and never will control this territory unless it's willing to wage an offensive war which comes with the risk of nuclear weapons hitting every major city in India. I think your pov on this situation is very limited and optimistic thinking 1) people will turn, as someone who grew up in the nation, 99% of the people are sheep and love the military (the actual entity that controls everything) 2) that even if they did turn they would go with India.
Bruh Pakistan has been nothing bust hostile since inception, India truly doesn't need Pakistan. Sure, would it be nice if Pakistan was friendly and/or they handed over Kashmir? Yes, but it's not necessary, on the other hand, without aid, Pakistan is in dore straits soon.

It would be very difficult for someone to convince me that the Republican party and American Christofascism is not taking direction (or at least in league with) Russian influences. These people are traitors to our nation.

What? You mean the timeline of: Russia annexes Crimea in 2014, Trump runs in 2015 and wins, starts fucking with Ukraine's gov. by threatening to withhold aid and getting impeached over it, the whole trump tower moscow thing, and praising Putin, Xi, and Un, threatening to pull out of NATO, and generally being a twat trying to stay in power illegally until finally getting the boot in 2021, prompting the Russians to have to rethink their angle of attack raises your suspicions?

After Obama produced his birth certificate and people continued to insist it was fake and that he wasn't American, then the trump fiascoes, it's extremely hard listening to anyone call people in the democratic party racist. "Jewish space lasers" seems way more inflammatory than anything Omar said.

Get them the fuck out and put people who actually have beliefs that they stand by into congress. God fucking rest John McCain, the gop needed more conservatives like him, that can genuinely compromise without capitulating to pressure, but they stuffed their board with election deniers and QAnon lovers so, they can sleep in the bed they made until they disintegrate from within.

Because when the republicans literally call the sitting president not American for four years and say his legal documents are fabricated, and then remove Omar for "being insensitive and making inflammatory remarks", it's a slap to the face of decent people, it's utter horseshit behavior, removing Omar was utter horseshit, it was purely political muscle flexing to get back at her and the liberals for some perceived slight from her politics and all the democratic wins in elections.

I don't fucking forget and ignore the shitty behavior of the GOP because that was 2 years of legal gridlock and obstinace at every opportunity that made anything we as Americans tried getting done in Congress an exercise in hot air. They are the biggest fan of locking everything down to get their way, and that's anything except serving the interests of the American people.

It's the republicans using every tactic available in bad faith to win political ground, not operating on the basis of improving American lives, that makes them shithole politicians I can't trust to represent anyone but themselves, and I don't want making legal decisions for the country in which I reside.

They put together that stupid new committee that they themselves drew together, announced that the minority party would only have 9 seats, and at least a majority need to vote on committee issues. By their own definitions, the minority party is just a spectator because the GOP can do whatever they want with their 12 member portion of the committee, and the dems will by design never have enough votes to stop them or impact any decisions. Does that sound like the practice of a party interested in genuine compromise, or like they want to lock out the other side from decisions?

Media was so desperate to show that there were some reasonable republicans who would choose country over party, that they clung to Sasse because he made mild criticisms of Trump. He backed that criticism up with absolutely no action whatsoever.

I don’t understand the voting critique. Most never Trump Republicans are quick to concede that he delivered a lot of the legislative wins they were hoping for.

According to 538 he voted with Trump , though that number is thrown off a bit since it includes Sasse voting against objecting to electors and against a few government funding measures, so in terms of substance it's a lot closer than that.

Even if I disliked someone personally, that would not change my view or support towards policy that I agreed with. Ona substance basis, Trump governed like a republican dream president. Sasse seemed to disagree with him primarily on style.
Newsflsh, it won’t be. We’ve already failed to stop a president from coordinating a coup d’etat, we’ve failed to address slavery and reparations, and we’ve failed to listen to women, ensure the federal government has a say over all state governments. We’re kinda fucked unless we take drastic measures, which well ignore again.

I think scrutinizing Trump's personal life, and constantly going after him for every little thing, just makes the establishment look more and more Petty. also, I can't imagine anything from his tax returns that would make me like him any less.

This is it. Trump is no longer useful for the GQP, the purging of him begins and it will be death by a thousand cuts. The best we can hope for is he goes toe to toe against them and fractures the GQP in the process.

With way the classification system works this is basically impossible. Tons of things are classified “just because” and it’s often up to the personal whims of a classification officer. For gods sake I had to have my resume reviewed when I left the military, and things were ok on my evaluations and awards were suddenly deemed classified.

yeah it's probably super common (in the case that people find documents that should have been returned and immediately return them) and wouldn't at all be newsworthy if it wasn't for Trump's scandal.

Yep but also the fact that Trump hasn’t been charged in his case despite literally obstructing and lying about it is what makes this even worse. Obvious crimes were committed in Trump case but the lack of charges allows the right to essentially ignore it. Biden situation should have an investigation but in both cases they need to be very transparent and inform the public what they find and if they do find crimes in either case charge them. The public trust in the DOJ is at an all time low because we are onto their shit and realize they don’t have any interest in holding the ruling class accountable.

This irks me in so many ways and the failure to hold Trump accountable for his much different situation is what is going to cause a ton of chaos around Biden’s. The Biden situation absolutely needs to be probed but in both cases we need way more transparency and public education on what/if was criminal in either case. Trump has obviously engaged in criminal conduct in how he obstructed the probe trying to get them back and also lying about it. He has to be held accountable yesterday, but the failure by feckless Garland is allowing the right to “both side” the shit out of this. Further eroding the public trust in the DOJ.

Short attention span? Maybe. But look at how many non-issues these people hold onto, that they will be frothing at the mouth about when an asshole right-wing commentator reminds them about it? Benghazi, Afghanistan exit, inflation. People will remember this in 2024.
All of the evidence was there: the ego, the past frauds, the debts, the complete inability to speak articulately or even coherently, the weird comportment and awful makeup, that coiffure, the fact that he bankrupted a casino, the absurd “policy” positions and insane promises, the sexism, the fact that his “debating” consisted almost exclusively of insulting people, the terrible reputation among New Yorkers and others who knew him, the draft-dodging, all of the sex assault allegations, the fact that he cheated on his third or fourth wife with a pornstar while they were pregnant, the fact that he bragged on TV about committing sexual assault, the fact that he talked about wanting to fuck his daughter, the fact that he publicly solicited help from Russia in swaying the election, and on and on… And a not-insubstantial number of self-proclaimed “patriots” thought that they knew better than intelligent people and still voted for this known conman.
It still never ceases to amaze me that there are people of such extreme, almost unfathomable levels of wanton and abject stupidity that they actually voted for this guy.

The one thing I can say that has shown some restraint from the Russians is that they haven't done any heavy bombing campaigns. If they did decide to use that tactic there will be 100000+ civilian casualties very quickly. So yes "they" can still go bigger without going nuclear.
They are unable to carry out bombing attacks because if they send aircraft over Ukraine they will lose them. The missile attacks that they send in are fired from hundreds or thousands of kilometres away.

They don't have enough shells, they are resorting to NK and Iran for help, Russia the second biggest military force is re-buying their own stockpiles of equipment sold to North Korea 30 or 50 years ago. So not a chance my dear friend. And if they buy equipment made in North Korea I expect even worse quality controls than Russia itself.

Russia lacks the air superiority needed to use traditional bombs or bomber aircraft within Ukraine, their heavy bombers stay hundreds of kilometers away well outside of Ukraine and launch cruise missiles.

Pick three gas station bathrooms anywhere outside of Wilminon. If you can't assemble an exhaustive list of every racial slur known to man from two of those three bathroom walls, you didn't visit North Carolina. I've had people in NC try to tell me this is 'normal'. It's really, really not normal. Nowhere else on the planet that I've lived or worked, have I seen the amount of casual racism that I saw in rural NC. I've lived in tacitly racist countries elsewhere on the globe. The level of hate I was exposed to in just one year of working out of NC was enough to have me swear off even passing through that state.

That has the potential to be overly restrictive. Temping at a lobbying group as a 19 year old prohibiting running for office in your 60s doesn’t make a lot of sense.

This will be the first time since 1984 that Democrats will control the state legislature in Michigan! And it’s important to note that this only happened because in 2018, voters in Michigan approved a citizen-initiated ballot referendum that transferred the power to draw voting maps from the state legislature to an independent redistricting commission.

As a result, Republicans were no longer able to draw egregiously gerrymandered maps that guaranteed their victories. The commission instead drew a map that was fair to both parties. As a result, Democrats were able to win control of the legislature for the first time in four decades!

Missouri passed it by referendum about 4-6 years ago, I think? Then at the next election Repubs put a very confusing ballot measure to get rid of it. They promoted it as “getting rid of money in politics” by lowering the amount state legislators could take in gifts from lobbyists. What they didn’t say was that it only lowered the amount by $5. ( And by the way, it moves redistricting back to the state legislature. But that was never mentioned in any ads about it).

All the campaign ads were about how this amendment would lower lobbyist gifts and campaign contributions. They never mentioned how little it would actually be lowered. They never mentioned it would change redistricting. You found out about that in the voting booth if you read it carefully.

The commission is made up of Michigan citizens and has to have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and then it also needs a certain number of independents. And I believe that maps can only be approved with a certain amount of support by all three groups. Someone with more knowledge about the specifics of the commission could probably better answer your question than me.

Michigan has an independent redistricting commission that draws maps, thanks to a 2018 ballot referendum. As a result, the current maps in Michigan are not gerrymandered, and they probably won’t be in the future unless the commission really fucks up.

And make Rail workers take it on the chin. They could make Rail companies take the hit, but noooo, can't make the companies hurt, gotta be the little guys. Not only that, but take away the little guy's only leverage in negations. This is unforgiveable for the party that says its pro labor.

It's not just rail that would be affected.. its everything rail touches like shipping, semi-truck driving, warehouse, rotting goods, food for both humans and livestock, fuel.. it's everything that needs to move from point a to b.

Which was done intentionally which allows the Senate to ignore it completely and/or vote it down. An insulting, token measure. If they were serious about it, those 7 days would be included in the main (and only) bill passed to the Senate, forcing them to pass it if a strike was that dire. Give these workers PTO. A single day is insulting.
There is no incentive for the US, France or the UK to push for a ceasefire. A Russian win is a loss for western Europe. Plus, and action like that would likely require military intervention, which the three western permanent members won't have the stomach for (they've been supplying Ukraine, you think they want to fight them?).
Can they? I am no expert on the UN, but wouldn't anything with any teeth have to go through the security council, which would require the US to sign off?

If backroom deals are made to stop this from becoming ww3 or it looks like it will go on forever in a stillmate they will most likely force a ceasefire and become another north and south Korea.

The US is watching their longest term enemy fall on it's face, they have no incentive to help them out of the pickle they've gotten themselves into. We are certainly costing them more money than we are spending (and we have more money to spend anyways), and aren't risking a single American soldier. It's the best situation for us.
I have this same question. Is it possible to have a declining workforce, and offset it completely with automation and other technology improvements? If that were possible, then the real question would become, what is the appropriate economic model for a world like that? For example, if all businesses had to give some % ownership to their city, more % to their province, and more % to the country (let’s say 5%, 10% and 15% respectively), would that kind of partial nationalization of businesses be helpful? The shares would be a special non-voting class that can’t be sold. Corporate tax would still be levied on revenues to give ongoing funding for Government programs, but each citizen would additionally have a tiny share of every business in the country, a slightly larger share in each business in the province, and a slightly larger share of local companies. As the collated dividend cheques come in, probably it would make people more business friendly and reduce nimbyism (not that that is a huge issue in China?). It also means that having more efficient companies and increasing automation would still benefit everyone, so long as total GDP is growing. The dividends would be paid to everyone over 18, and at some smaller rate for children, so their would still be incentive to work if you can still find a job.
Stagnate maybe but not dying, even if their population slowly declines in this century the wealth and industry they managed to build up in the last 30 years isn't going to magically evaporate. They may not overtake the USA in terms of global economic impact but they'll still be a competitive 2nd runner up.

I actually said exactly that to my mom last night. We both agreed he's probably going to want a woman, because that's what Biden did. The problem with Marjorie and Kari Lake is just that they're as loud and nuts as he is, so they'll be in the news stealing some of his spotlight constantly, which he definitely couldn't handle. Pence was perfect for that because he's so boring that no one outside of Indiana ever even remotely cared about his existence, but that ship has sailed so now he has to find someone else that's an enabler willing to put up with his shit, while still being lowkey enough to not overshadow him.

No acceptable outcome for Gaetz. He's not a total moron, just the "natural evolution" of "public servants" openly and only publicly servicing themselves. Get a room, or something!
It's astonishing. Most hypocrites at least try to sound reasonable, even when the reason is bullshit. Like when mcconnell said it was okay to block Obama's SC nomination because it was an election year, but when he wanted to push through barrett he said "oh it's different when the presidency and senate are controlled by the same party". He knows it's bullshit, we know it's bullshit. But at least there's a flimsy reasoning. This guy just blatantly says "i can do this but you can't" or "what i did was not a crime, but she did the same thing and she needs to be punished for it.".

This is a very good point that I'm shocked that I didn't take into account as someone who lives in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, specifically), because everything you said is true.
And if North Korea sends troops to Ukraine, South Korea must seriously consider doing so as well, or at least a very large number of non--combatant Abrams and F-16 maintenance technicians, fully equipped. Just as Israel and Saudi Arabia Iraq, and Turkey must more than respond to what Iran has done in Ukraine. The Pacific Rim nations must respond to what China and India (after their abstention votes in the UN) are or are not, doing in Ukraine. As the worlds most populous neighbors, they both have the most to gain from the "support the non-aggressor" precedents increasingly being reinforced in Ukraine.
Even power outages in Ukraine might be less severe than in areas of NK. Can you imagine what their reactions will be when they enter places that are still largely intact? Food, services, basic conveniences? When you can get shot for watching a western movie in NK(if testimonies are true) - the chance to live free, to escape, and be hidden as a “ casualty of war”? I’d be screaming, “take it Defect and fight for Ukraine” I’d bet on that being the better choice by a mile.
From the article it seems that the family was shot at, starved, lost everything and almost died as the Russians sieged and took the city. But they survived. Now the mother works in the occupant "administration" of the territory and this gives the family an income and some security for now. A chance to live.
Yeah, I saw this "concert". Fucking disgraceful but typical of the lenhs that Putins propaganda ministry will go to. And the stupid sheep in the audience of whom many were forced to be there, lap it up. Utter cringe fest of nationalist vomit.

They may not expect the city to be ever liberated by Ukrainian forces, so they adapt and lick the boot they need to lick to not starve and freeze or be shot in a ditch. Even people who would stand up for themselves no mattter the cost will often grin and bear it when their childrens' lives are on the line, and I will not judge them for that.

Or door number 3, he has no real assets to speak of, the Devolder Organization is just a shell corp (he's given about three different versions of what it does to make money, and none of them really make sense), and the money that was spent on his campaign came from Russia or other sources that he felt that it was worth lying about on a federal election filing to keep secret.

I wonder if he is even a US citizen, and if he is, when was he naturalized, since according to some accounts of colleagues, he claimed he was Brazilian. Naturalized citizens have to wait 7 years before running for office.

That's kind of what I was thinking too, thanks for that link, some interesting things I hadn't heard before:
"Stolen" isn't really used in a legal sense here. Most of the African artifacts in European museums were taken as bounties of war or were taken by an empire during the colonial period. None of this was illegal at time (though there was also plenty of illegal grave robbing ect.). It is by today's moral standards that we regard this as theft not necessarily by legal ones.
And most of the Bronzes are still in London and THOSE people have the gall to say that the Bronzes are for "everyone" and that Nigeria shouldn't get them back.

Cool... can a Nigerian just board a plane for the cost of a bus ticket, take a plane ride to London and just enter visa free to take a look at their OWN HISTORY? Those aren't just "some statues". The rulers of Benin commissioned them after any significant event in their history. So instead of history books, their history is "written" within those statues.

"History is for all" is cool and all, but primarily it should be for those that take their heritage from it. A sense of shared history is essential for a shared identity which is essential for a stable and functioning nation.
It's really not rocket science. Doug Mastriano was up there beating his chest about ending abortion in the state, and Oz was not even from here. Their views are dying, hence they're only popular in areas of the state with lower populations that tend to have a higher age. The only thing they have going for them over the dems in the state is that they're slightly more small business friendly than the dems in PA - if they were smart they'd lean into that aspect, but they will only go for identity politics - which is wearing off on the conservative suburban voters and only really resonating with smaller populations in Pennsyltucky. The middle class is struggling increasingly year over year and they're a one trick pony that's getting pretty long in the tooth and the dems ran better candidates. It's really not a puzzling thing.

My concern is that the Revolutionary Guard are deeply integrated into the political/economic/military system of Iran. It's akin to designating the military of another nation as terrorists.
This is likely to cause further unrest to an already volatile set of circumstances in the Middle East, and I think is a step backwards to settling things diplomatically.

We're pushing to designate the IRGC as terrorists and calling for countries to recall their ambassadors so that the regime are completely cut off from the rest of the world. Sanctions are already heavily effecting the economy but proscribing them would reduce any trade left to essentially nothing which would put even more pressure on the government. And it would also mean that members of IRCG can't escape to other countries.

I've been in therapy since I was 13 for anxiety and depression and given over 30 different meds over the years and nothing worked and finally I had to pay $4,000 for psychological testing and found out im autistic and adhd-c at 33. Finally getting with the right psychologist and psychiatrist and on the right meds. It isn't always easy. I still have to find the right ADHD med ad well as the right dose.

Really is not comparable. This isn't like taking away a person's right to be on a jury or even to vote. This takes away rights to due process and safety, and ability to travel internationally. Not for an actual crime, but for expressing opinions -- literally nothing more. Felony disenfranchisement has a history in some of the same principles, but permanent disenfranchisement for felons has gone down substantially. Most states in the US today only prohibit voting and jury service while you are actively under parole/probation supervision and re-enfranchise you once you're done. The number of disenfranchised felons actually dropped more than 25% since 2016 due to additional reforms.
They become stateless, which is not a fun legal place to be. It's also against international law for a nation to make someone stateless, but since when has that slowed Russia down?

Nah, they figured out who he was and where his family was and that he lied about everything and deliberately lost his papers. For some reason, they did not revoke his refugee status and deport him like they should have.
Honestly, we're gonna get fucked either way now. Let's pray right decisions will be made, but this shit isn't going to be left unpunished. Russia is gonna get it somehow and they'll see it as provocation, or China will think it's too weak and fuck with Taiwan more. Either way, lose-lose.

Article 4 is a nation (Poland) bringing this as a formal discussion with NATO. This will lead to either (likely) designating the missile incident as an accident, leaving it at that. Or, (unlikely) using it as an excuse to increase military readiness.

Western policy towards Iran has been a huge miserable, nonsensical failure for 45 years… Israel is now chiming up to Russia because it fears a Russian victory in this war yet they are owe their existence to the west for its security yet the entire Western world, for Israel’s sake, keeping in mind Iran has never invaded another country or initiated a war itself, have heavily sanctioned, alienated and forced Iran into resorting to depending on the development of a homegrown and now formidable military arsenal that it has today that it would not have had if it didn’t have these harsh measures forced onto it, and now aligning itself with a country like Russia, who in reality is actually its historical rival and regional foe rather than a friend or allie … and still, still the west keep pushing in the wrong direction having not learnt a thing yet and leaving nothing to salvage in relations.
Considering that Iran does not have nuclear weapons at the moment… but doing its best to acquire them, been part of None Proliferation Treaty is more or less meaningless.

Looking at the Senate and the races that will be up for election Democrats will be lucky to hold the senate actually. In the house Republicans also have a large built in advantage. Biden also does not draw a lot of enthusiasm and unfortunately it looks like he will be the nominee. Republicans are far from dead unfortunately. But who knows a lot can change in 2 years.

I don't understand where this expectation comes from that they're just going to share all the details about something that is clearly a national security matter.
Of course they are, there's a massive ethnic cleansing campaign underway in E. Jerusalem. Oh you don't have the right permits from our occupying force that won't give you permits? There goes your home.
You build a home without a permit in a lot of the US - you have to pay to tear it down. You also can't build on land where you don't have title to the land. There is an entire industry built around this basic concept in countries like the US. About the only major exception I am aware of in the US is in Puerto Rico where the government actually has very lax rules on proof of ownership, permits and such but that is also why so many homes 5 years after 2 major hurricanes are still damaged and ineligible for FEMA funding for repairs - no proof of ownership for the land and the homes weren't built to code or with permits.

Besides, we have an example of the law not being slightly fair to those under its jurisdiction depending on whether or not they're jewish - Nokdim is blatantly illegal since it exists outside of established borders, but is it being torn down? No, it's expanding.

Bedouin, for example, prexists Israel. They aren't building 'wherever they want', the people there are building where they've always lived.

But I suppose if it's fair for Israel, then I guess we should just let Russia annex Ukraine and don't dare speak out when they deny the people living there before them their land.

Palestinian permits have a 0.81% success rate - it's obviously discrimination. Is it legal? It technically is - but so is getting executed for sorcery in Saudi Arabia, but something tells me you wouldn't mock someone for pointing out how horrid that is.
apparently my English is really bad, I will write through a translator. the T14 is designed for a different engine, a new one, this engine is not being built now, there are no factory capacities, there are no long-term operational checks, there is a rather large complexity in manufacturing and operation. also with the transmission, the use of Western aiming systems and night vision systems can not even be remembered. it is radically different from the tanks of the 70 series. The T72 is still in service as the main battle tank, there are repair plants and well-known engines for it. the fact that the t14 was designed and there was enough knowledge and strenh for it - I do not dispute, but there is no capacity to manufacture a commercial quantity, there is no time to create these capacities either. I know about the continuity of generations in the development and production of tanks, as well as any other equipment. But the T14 is not the successor of the 70th series. Due to corruption and massive abuse of state subsidies, the Russian army does not have these tanks in service, plus global production problems. This is another beautiful picture from Russian propagandists and a story about the Great Army. In the army, there are not even enough underpants with socks, not to mention the t14.
They want to sell the tank abroad. With a selling price of 4 million usd it would be a disaster if it would spread on youtube how easily the ukrainians can take it out from a distance with a single javelin or something similar.
I have almost got to the stage where I don't give a shit any more, I recycle everything, I buy items with less packaging, I insulated my house, I bought low powered cars which are much better of fuel, etc etc etc. Yet none of that makes even the slightest bit of difference as the goverments and corporations who actually can make a huge difference will do fk all because they will have to make a little less profit.
The issue is transparency availability and again it's a broken system. No matter how hard I try (another American here) nothing matters. They burn and dump all our shit in the same spots. Make sure to make ev impossible. Where we spend our dollars ends up back in like 10 companies hands who also have a large stake in oil. It's time for a French revolution type of solution but it's not feasible in today's age. So all were left with is throwing ice into the ocean hoping it helps as corporations ensure it doesn't matter.

At the global scale we know how. Reduce fossil fuel dependence/ emissions, increase sustainability of our food and consumer products, and protect and restore global ecosystems. We know what corporations are having the biggest impact. So individually, in my opinion, the biggest impact each of us can make is with how we spend our dollars. The motivation is profit driven.

Ill raise you one, we (Australia) had a program called REDcycle where people could drop off soft plastics to be recycled at major supermarkets. Turns out it was just being stockpiled in warehouses creating a fire hazard so the EPA has directed them to dump all 5200 tonnes of soft plastic into landfill.

Yup, that's where i'm going now, I am getting solar panels fitted next year and that is solely to drop my reliance on the grid so I no longer have to pay so much for power etc.
I guarantee they went though all available options before choosing this course of action. I’ve seen airlines light mountains of money on fire to complete a flight in irregular operations like this. The two biggest factors in this were probably the inability to get a legal crew to the aircraft in a timely manner to fly it back to NZ, and the long distance from any other airports with Air New Zealand service with scant resources available for recovery.
They can’t use another terminal because of customs. And they can’t move customs temporarily. At best they could have diverted to LAX when they received the NOTEM or another international airport enroute, but it would have grounded the plane until JFK terminal 1 reopened and the flight crew had their minimum rest. Then the plane would have to be repositioned either in JFK before it could fly passengers again which would involve flying an empty plane for 6 hours. It’s a pain for everyone, but from a logistics standpoint, it makes sense why they turned around.

I'm not saying what he did was morally good, but he was seen as "good" at the time. The "grace" wasn't in an absolute/divine sense, but in a public perception sense. Obviously, reality caught up with him and any support he still enjoys is from the ignorant and repugnant.

I don't know how old you were during or around 9/11, but, he was (for a time) one of the most popular and beloved politicians in America. Widely seen as responsible for cleaning up NYC and overseeing the city's response to 9/11. I'm sure there have been many chronicles of his descent, but, yeah, "fall from grace" is an apt metaphor.
Three months but you are a wreck at the end of it and really need to eat. Water is the more important substance in this case that you can go about four days without before you start having problems.
If we miss a meal we get angry, if we can’t eat for a while we are gonna be pretty upset, sad, etc. This man, on day 23 of eating ketchup, looked at his reflection in the water and went not today motherfucker, and kept on living.

Bouillon cubes used to be in little basic survival kits, mostly because they don’t spoil and you can mix them with water. Beef or chicken normally, boil it up if you have a heat resistant cup and it gets a warm soup broth. Not huge calories but it can help in a pinch.

Yeah bouillon cubes is a generic name for all of them short for beef bouillon. They also make a chicken cube for chicken stock. Makes cooking soup easier if you don’t have time to make your own stock.
I think this is news because we didn’t use a spinning death blade drone to kill them and instead caught them alive? Weird how it doesn’t specify if they were high ranking or of some importance value vs “regular” militants.
Obviously it was primarily the fight against ISIS. ISIS started making huge gains and in Iraq and Syria and was engaged in massacres. Massacring yazidis, shia, Christians any non Sunni, not to mention enslaving women and children.

A coalition of dozens of nations were providing military aid and support in Syria and direct attacks on ISIS. Not just the US but the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Bahrain, Jordan,Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and numerous other nations.

There was and is ongoing the Syrian civil war so many of these countries were also supporting rebel Syrian Democratic forces and Kurdish forces against the Assad regime and ISIS.

I'm well aware of the history thanks. I've never stopped calling out the need for US to be there. I do understand that it's not really so much about ISIS but to prevent the sphere of Iranian influence in the region. It's well documented.

When all Asad used International Prohibited weapons, where were the US and the rest of the world? I can tell you. They were searching for oil. When we almost took down the Alasad regime and then Russia started having direct involvement in the war, where was the savor US? I can tell you, they were searching for oil.

I guess my point wasn't clear enough. They are searching to fish in the muddy swamp called Syria. Oil here is just a reference to the benefits each side is seeking.

Syria had a very small oil industry and it's controlled by the Syrian (Assad regime) government. How the hell was fighting ISIS in Syria an oil defense mission?

That said most Americans have no comprehension how much suffering their troops have caused around the world. No justifiable reason for the Iraq invasion. Barely any justification for Afghanistan.

Sorry, I got a little heated up but I really can't stand people painting a positive view towards those political monsters that left hundreds of thousands of innocent people to die just like that for their political agendas. Especially when I myself, lost some people I know.

Our border with Russia is 1344 km long, which makes this issue quite difficult. The war is of course possible. On the other hand Finland and Russia have such a long tradition of "friendship" policy, that it might help even in this situation right now, when the Russian-Finnish relationship is freezingly cold. It is really at the lowest level since 1920's. That's like a total U-turn compared to previous. But still the history of our relationship might help us to prevent the war.
It might take years to get us in. In Finland we feel though, that we are relatively well prepared for the war. Finland is buying huge amounts of weapons right now. Deals worth of billions have been made during the past half a year. And Finland's already existing weapon storages are huge. They say that all Finland's weapons put to a one train would make the train over thousand kilometers long.

On the other hand we have one of the most successful welfare states in the whole world. If the war some day appears, the welfare state might vanish. I personally believe that Finland and Russia will avoid full scale war.

I believe they'll avoid full scale war with Finland because they won't have anything left to invade it with. Tanks, AF, all disappeared at the hands of Ukraine. Slava 🇺🇦.
I feel like at this point a major offensive would doom the Russian war effort. Even if they gain ground they will likely be unable to hold their gains and weaken their defense more.
This could be the breaking point in the trajectory of the war. If Ukraine is really ready to fight something more like a set battle, they should consider ways of softening up the enemy or making the ground muddier or preparing the event by starting the fight early with various ways of making it a very difficult path for Russia. The ground itself should be their enemy. Thinks like trenches for tanks to get stuck in, Patriot batteries to kill in-coming rockets, like the "Surrender Hotline" to get Russian soldiers to surrender and thus ruin their unit cohesion, those are the types of things to undermine and destroy any Russian offensive.

In the Eastern fight Ukraine knows the territory and the opposing forces and is winning. In a direct assault on Kyiv it's also known, but it could be somehow different this time. That difference needs to be made irrelevant, if that's possible.
Even if that were implemented, it'll still be better for the environment than vehicle-mounted internal combustion engines.
The best way for me to describe it is as a combination of , the , and ; moreover, you need to think of fossil fuel power plants as giant engines in order for it to make sense.

The combustion chambers of big engines have more volume relative to their external surface area than smaller engines, meaning that, for each unit of heat they produce, less of that heat radiates outwards through the surface area, meaning more fuel energy gets turned into usable energy.

If an engine is a cube 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter in size, it has 1 m3 of volume to burn things in (heat production) and 6 m2 of surface area to loose heat through (heat loss). That's a generation:loss ratio of 1:6.

Scale that engine up twice. Now, it's a cube 2 meters by 2 meters by 2 meters in size. It has 8 m3 of volume and 24 m2 of surface area; a ratio of 1:3.

Scale the first engine up ten times and you get one that's 10 meters by 10 meters by 10 meters, with 1,000 m3 of volume and only 600 m2 of surface area. Now, the ratio is 5:3.

Huh, seems to be true. But I thought clouds raise albedo, and spraying seawater into the air was proposed for that purpose? "Marine cloud brightening". So that's confusing.

"Water is a greenhouse gas," is a common denialist talking point. Its true, but by and large, it isn't an enhanced greenhouse gas, because it saturates in air based on temperature and condenses. Most parts of the atmosphere already have all the water they are going to get, give or take the day's weather. The greenhouse effect is why the planet has an average temperature above freezing. The enhanced greenhouse effect is why that temperature is increasing, and it's the effect of concern.

Also; a lot of various hydrogen-nitrogen compounds, (like Ammonia), including hydrazine, hydrogen cyanide, diimide, nitric oxide (and other NOx species), most of which are kind of toxic and nasty.

Obviously, an all-green power grid is the best option, but big fossil fuel-powered electric plants driving electrolysis to fuel hydrogen engines is still better than those hydrogen engines being replaced with gasoline ones.

Burning Hydrogen with ONLY Oxygen, produces H2O - only, which is less of a concern than the NOx-es. These turbines will burn hydrogen in AIR, not Oxygen.

Adding water vapour at particular heights in the air column can be somewhat problematic, but the effect likely isn't as significant or long lived as CO2 emission effects.

That doesn't sound like "profanities flying" to me... Guess Fox went for a bit of a hyperbolic headline there for the clicks, I was expecting reports of yells of Fuck You, Kevin! from the House Floor.
except thanks to HIMARS that had kinda been neutralized quite some time ago. Since HIMARS outranges Russian batteries. Ukraine opens up on mobniks, Russia returns fire, maybe the Ukranian artillery is damaged by a lucky shot instead of an inaccurate shell from a worn out Russian barrel, but a nearby HIMARS will counter fire and eliminate the Russian artillery anyway.
Cannon fodder only works to draw out artillery if you don't have counter fire waiting for you. Like a pawn in chess protected from capture by a knight.

Response: HIMARs ensures any Russian counter battery fire on Ukrainian targets is neutralized without reprisal which makes the purpose of arty spotting cannon fodder pointless as a casualty of not just the fodder but the artillery team using them as bait.

The definition of "working" here is that russian mobik is valued far lower then a Ukrainian Heroy. Putin doesn't care if 10 untrained gopniks die in order to take out of war a single well trained and equipped soldier with experience and dedication. For russia and russians a single injured Ukrainian is worth his/her weight in gold.

Neutralised how exactly? On the frontlines they have come to a gridlock, as was recently stated by Ukraines defence ministry. And HIMARS aren’t stopping all missiles that are hitting Ukrainian infrastructure and civilians nearly every single day from the front lines all the way through to Odessa, Kyiv and Lviv. Ukraine might be knocking 70+ /100 missiles a day but many are still making its way through, hence the constant power outages across country.

While I can appreciate Xi wanting to trade in this own currency, the yuan is just too fishy. No way they’ll take money that is adjusted not by market forces, but by fiat.
It's probably more about if petrol dollar isn't a thing they can induce inflation of USD and hurt US. Also easier to avoid sanctions if you aren't using USD.

Also a good point (not inducing inflation in an economy that buys Chinese goods). It seems a bit too altruistic to me to do that though. The second part, avoiding sanctions, sounds more realistic to me.

The question if China is a strategic mastermind or just stumbling around is an interesting topic. Some think belt and road is an world dominating plan and other just a employment program for Chinese workers.

To underestimate China is to do so at one’s peril. BRI, in my limited understanding, is absolutely a way to cement control over infrastructure and commerce and primarily benefit China, while also strenhening emerging economies and relationships in Africa and the Middle East. Established economies benefit China less, but having a strong presence in those first-world countries is important for technology “acquisition” and competitive intelligence.
The same sort of thinking is needed on immigration. We will need a lot more workers to re-tool our economy to deal with climate change. But that's true everywhere. Places already experiencing climate crisis, like Central America, must have a path for survival that would employ their own people to save their homelands. That will take international funding so that they can get what they need from the rest of the world that they can't make for themselves. This is less about money than it is about planning and the will to invest in the future.

Tomorrow's tweet from Elon, "turns out I fired all the people in charge of unbanning people and I don't have the keys to their offices, so Trump is remain banned for the foreseeable future.".

It's frankly impressive how much of a shithead he is. That idiot was even saying that the poll was being attacked by leftist bots at some point.

Our media is so gullible. And so is the population. We fall for every single publicity stunt, even when they are obvious. Who cares if he put out a poll? Who cares if he reinstated trump’s account? He is doing nothing but trying to draw headlines.

I’m saying Elon Musk is trying to draw clicks to twitter. You are clearly falling for these weak media attempts.

If you want to Trump to have less power on twitter….stop using twitter. Otherwise, you are part of the problem.
For example, let's say that your birth name was Hitler Adolph Brown. You hate the name for obvious reasons and have asked to be called Tim instead. Freedom of speech says that people can call you whatever they way right? So all day long people are calling out your name purposefully. Let's say you go the extra step of legally changing your name to Tim Brown. But someone at work finds out that your birth name was Hitler and they think it's hilarious to use it whenever they see you. "Oh hey Hitler. How's it going?", "what's up Adolph", "Doing any painting or anything fun this weekend Hitler?" I mean it's just free speech right? They're just words right?

These right-wing terrorists are all about killing who they've been told are "grooming and sexualizing" children but soon as you show them a list of catholic priests and southern Baptist preachers who have actually harmed and raped children, suddenly they go quiet.

Before the year ends, the Republican majority in Ohio's statehouse wants to pass Nearly all of the bills are based in bigotry, but this bill seems like an odd choice for the party of "family values":

They also want to pass anti-trans legislation. They dubbed it the "Save Adolescents from Experimentation” Act despite the fact that allowing trans teens to be on puberty blockers/hormones is not "experimentation." Allowing trans teens to receive gender-affirming care lowers the . Denying a trans person's gender kills them.
The West then decides to sanction these nations. Which is just going to make them more angry. Because its justifying the idea that the war is about race rather than democracy. Because they ain't sanctioning people as hard over Ethiopia with 600,000 dead.
During Apartheid the US supported the White minority rule. While the USSR and China black revolutionaries.

There was a slight shift after the civil rights movement in the 1960s. But it only became a US talking point in the late 1980s early 1990s.

African, South American, South East Asian, India and China are all in similar situations. The European powers (EU) for the majority of the last 70 years have been the "enemy". Usually supported by the US as a counter to communism/ now China.

When the Ukraine war started they may have felt some basic sympathy for Ukraine. As they too suffered unjust foreign invasion and occupation. However the longer the war went the more absurd the situation became.

There are ongoing major conflicts in Lybia, Ethiopia and Congo. Which for the most part the west has ignored. At the same time you have Western nations ( the very same colonial powers) showing up and shouting "if you don't support Ukraine your arn't for human rights and democracy". At the same time documents are coming out that the Dutch and French assassinated beloved leaders like Lumumba because they could have actually developed their nations.

Putin then has his speech in which he directly references this and says "remember it was the USSR that helped you fight European colonialism". The Western response is "Putin is crazy (he is but not on this point) everything he says is shit. Hey South Africa you for freedom right?".

Even if war broke out in Europe, it's a European war not an African one. They still only support Russia to an extent. Then if shit hits the fan, the same way that we ignore Goma they will simply change the channel.

So TLDR is South Africa isn't going to support Ukraine not because they support Russia. They will do it because western hegemony has terrible foreign policy in the global south. Same for India, Brazil, Nigeria etc...

So a year after the war most of the world is either indifferent or assists Russia out of a sense of loyalty for their liberation struggles ( South Africa). The UN has a vote that has 141 but the remaining 52 countries account for more than 1/2 of the global population.

If the US had come to South Africa on a equal playing field and discussed the issue of Ukraine in a geopolitical context. Focused on better trade and military corporation with Mozambique ( ISIS) then maybe things would be different. They tried to use a moral justification while in South African history they are the problem.

I see that some countries keep mixing USSR and Russia. While there are similarities in that both have been ruthless authoritarian oppressive entities without rule of law, modern Russia is a nationalist imperial cleptocracy without any ideological foundation other than national supremacy, revanchism and imperialism.
“the dead are two lieutenant generals, eight major generals, 44 colonels, 98 lieutenant colonels, 193 majors, 279 captains, 471 senior lieutenants, 235 lieutenants and 72 soldiers of other ranks”.
They have artillery going for them because unlike the other professionals soldiers that died on the frontline, the artillery units are alive because they're safe at the back. For now. I bet Ukraine are targeting them next.

they destroyed a lot of artillery. The safe ones are deep in Russia/Belarus that are firing the long range ballistic missiles. But they are starting to run low on those.

That’s just not the case though, when you have no NCOs in your units that further ties your officers to NCO level tasks. They have to work down. I kinda get what you are saying, their seniority is amplified in a sense but it’s not reality. If you have a company of troops and you take away the corporals and sergeants then your lieutenants don’t become captains, your lieutenants end up having to act as corporals and sergeants, and then the captain ends up having to work steps down as well. Without NCOs you end up even increasing the threshold for what a “high ranking officer” is.

Meanwhile they appoint and award all the top level managers, VPs, etc, whilst us, who actually are boots on the ground DOING the work are largely ignored, never consulted, and pegged into lower level positions with no chance for advancement. Are told we should consider ourselves lucky we have our jobs, though WE are the cogs that keep the machine rolling and actually CARE about our students. It's quite frustrating.

It's depressingly common. I'm currently over a year into litigation against a school that did this in PA, CEO said similar things regularly, i'm told average is 2-3 years to reach a settlement, in the best possible scenario. In the meantime, most employers won't touch me with a 10-ft pole. Also their only legal obligation in the end is for them to pay the difference between what I would've made at their job vs what I actually made instead. Would sure be nice if Biden and congress emboldened the NLB, and/or Shapiro and the newly Democratic state house made right to work laws a priority. As long as the entire system is stacked in their favor, employers will continue to act this way.

Lmfao. Same government that deflected faults of the Itaewon crisis while secluding selective media outlets because they reported some negative information that he said?
It's embarrassing to admit but better under this scenario than a more serious one. Given this and what we are seeing in Ukraine it's clear the value of drones on the battlefield is real and hard to counter. Likely we will be seeing the deployment of anti-drone....drones in the next few years. Launching helicopters, fighter jets, & missiles is just not cost-effective when it's against a drone that probably cost $10k or less.

Literal trainwreck after trainwreck disaster. But all he does is nothing but deflect blame rather than plan an actual counter measure that would have meaningful effect. I’d say that’s a setback rather than a start.

Not really. He was rambling about not having a dedicated drone unit when we literally have one and had one since 2018. Then he started going off on the fucking defense minister for “not being prepared” as if shooting 500+ rounds, crashing a fucking jet and following with helicopters weren’t enough.

Yoon didn’t even know we had dedicated drone force, when it was set up in 2018. How the fuck do you not know this during a security hearing.

Every time I follow a link to Twitter it's nothing but a cess pool. I'm not LGBTQ+ and I just don't care how people conduct themselves as long as they're not harming others. I can't imagine getting so mad about this that you show up and yell at strangers. No one has ever demonstrated how a person reading a book to a child hurts them. It just makes me think these protesters are the actual pedos / self-loathers. They hate that aspect of themselves but take it out on others. Admitting they have unresolved issues is too painful.

i was shopping for a hula hoop for my kids on amazon, came across one, noticed the reviews were all about the marketing photo of a kid and then there was a discussion about how it's sexualizing, etc. the photo on amazon had been removed by the time i came about it, but i found it on the brand's website and it was just a kid in a normal gym outfit posing with the hula hoop.

Ooh - she’s awesome. Way too junior to be a serious candidate for Speaker but I’d love to see her get more visibility in the party. I am somewhat disheartened that she didn’t perform better in her re-election but running in a new district is always a challenge.

- prior to implementing his special elections police force, virtually all voter and election fraud in Florida was committed by Republicans; since DeSantis appointed his own police unit, he has targeted Democrats and Independents only (and those fraudulent prosecutions have been dismissed by judges).

Its not just Western companies doing this anymore either. China is the the big one now. They've moved into areas like gold mining in Colombia and completely taken over. And they are ruthlessly efficient. Western companies always tried to pretend like they were the good guys and going to be a net positive. When this never happened, a lot of Western companies had issues with local disruption, paramilitary groups stealing and attacking their operations, etc. The Chinese come in and just straight up bribe everyone: the government, the paramilitaries, rebels, corrupt local officials. Instead of bullshit about helping develop and be a first world nation they just are like "Who wants some money? Here you go. We're taking the gold/oil/REM/water.".
The issue is a bit more complicated. Africa is huge for one, and viewing it as a monolith is a common mistake. Lacking human capital is also half true, educated people are often offered better and more stable jobs overseas. Why be a professor in a country that can’t pay you on time. So there’s a serious brain drain and general lack of opportunity over large areas mean that rural areas are left to languish. So any opportunity is welcome, even if it’s an ecological disaster, its a way out.

sick leave = 3 days of unpaid leave with 30 days notice. That isn't good enough for workers touching something that if shut down costs the country billions. Shut it down and get some real sick days.

A complete and total violation of the separation of powers. Trying to prevent the president from doing his job via a bogus interpretation of administrative law. God only knows how many administrative laws Trump broke, and I didn't hear a damn thing from the GOP then. It's not about the law, it's about controlling the opposing party and denying them the ability to enact their policies.

“In sum, the Court finds that the Plaintiff States have established a substantial likelihood of success based on the CDC’s failure to comply with the rulemaking requirements of the [Administrative Procedure Act]. This finding is sufficient to satisfy the first requirement for injunctive relief,” Summerhays wrote in his ruling.

No, the context is perfectly fine. If the executive branch can rewrite the rules, then other branches can't say they're in violation of the current rules when the administration can simply rewrite them to reflect current policy. The executive branch has its own sphere of influence and Title 42 is a part of that, just like executive orders.

If they can find jobs, let them work...our immigration policy is absolutely insane. White people do not own this land, and our Constitution is suppose to protect all law-abiding people. But when you literally make it illegal to even be in the country, what the hell are people suppose to do? They're coming in for the same reason our own immigrant ancestors did: for better opportunities.
hopefully people from some other countries take note, they either start shit or theyre slowly being sent to their deaths.
These protests are going to have to change power on their own and lots of Iranian people are probably going to lose their lives going against their corrupt and backwards government. I don't want to see another Arab spring intervention which cripples Iran as a country and drives it into civil war, I just want to see their damn regime replaced and 50% of their population finally be seen as equals.

Please let these protests succeed and help finally recognise women as equals, actually let Iranians voice their opinions and engage with the world again. It's crazy looking at old videos and photos from the dictatorship days and seeing an Iran that looks more modern and free than it does today.

Thank you to the Iranians who are standing up against their repressive theocratic mafia government. It comes at an incredible cost and hopefully sooner than later that evil regime will be tossed into the dustbin of history.

I think anyone brave, honourable and intelligent in Russia has already been killed, locked up or has fled the country to look for a future life where you aren't under a corrupt and brutal dictatorship.

People just don't see what benefit getting out with no results or even publicity will do, when your and your family's livelihood and/or life are at stake. So maybe they're slightly less brave than the Iranians, but to conclude that means there's overwhelming support for Putin is a huge leap. Belarusians did huge protests in 2020, but haven't been seen doing that lately. Does that mean they now suddenly love Lukashenko? Of course not.

That's a myth. A lot of Russians still like Putin, but many of those only grudgingly so. The percent of fervent supporters is below 50%. There were significant protests at the start of the war (and periodically since 2011), which were harshly repressed by Putin's well-funded thugs. The last vestiges of independent media were also destroyed for good back then, which inhibits the protests' reporting to an extent rivalling Iran. That's also effective at making people feel isolated and alone, that their viewpoints "aren't shared by the majority".

Also, last I checked, Russia's overall standard of living is a bit higher than Iran's, which is definitely a factor in both why so many Russians are apathetic and why they aren't exactly rushing in to die for Putin and his yachts, palaces and oligarchs. They have to be forced to do it instead. Apathy, not support, is the dominant feeling in Russia.

A lot of the Western misconceptions about Russia like the one you mentioned are exactly what fuel Putin's murderous and illegitimate regime.

I lived in Russia for around 5 years in late 1990s-early 2000s (excluding holidays abroad), right at the end of Russia's full democratic experiment, and when Putin's authoritarian (now totalitarian) regime was starting to chip down at civil liberties and democracy. I also read both government and anti-government Russian media, so the guy who responded to you is wrong.

Uh, that's also a myth, Navalny and his associates have defended Ukraine's right to Crimea and Donbass, for example, and want good relations with the West, but tried for years to not run afoul of Russia's laws that question its "territorial integrity", including of Russia's annexed territories. Russia would naturally acquire a stronger natural "sphere of influence" around itself akin to the one US has with Canada and Mexico solely because of its size and economic growth, but its worst impulses would always be constrained through the presence of democratic checks and balances, and would be of a very different nature to the relations current Putin's Russia has.

Putin's 20+ years of brainwashing have definitely taken a toll, including outside of Russia, but as the memories of the 2000s economic boom recede (with declining real incomes for almost a decade now) and Russia's worldwide influence and situation become worse, Putin's leverage and prestige among the population has been falling. However, so far he's been careful to keep a relatively good life in Moscow and St. Petersburg (where a threat to his power would be most apparent) by sucking ever more resources from the countryside to those centers, to compensate for the lack of economic development as a whole in the country.

If Russia becomes democratic, it'd naturally integrate itself with Western countries, for one, and they'll likely adopt a carrot-and-stick relationship. With democracy and economic growth, imperialist temptations would slowly fade from public discourse, or at the very least become more akin to those of the United States. If you unlock those keys together for the first time ever with Russia, great things will happen. But for now, as we're living through these tumultuous times, there isn't even a guarantee Putin will leave the Kremlin before he dies, or of what'll happen after him.

That was a prediction of a status quo, not an approval of the fact. In the same speech, he called for a new, "proper" referendum, and said "Crimea is part of Russia de facto", but "was seized in blatant violation of all international norms".

Further, he said Crimea wasn't even on the Russian political agenda prior to 2014, not mentioned even by nationalists.

So maybe not in the exact way Ukraine would like it, but he's definitely not claiming it to be part of Russia forever. If he wants a democratic Russia, he'd have to build relations with the West, and they won't stand for a repeat of the 2014 "referendum", so he likely means a UN or internationally-observed vote of some kind. He also, again, made those claims while living in 2010s Russia, where laws and repression were already advanced and becoming worse every new year. Boris Nemtsov was killed outside the Kremlin after condemning the takeover of Crimea and conducting pro-Ukraine rallies, for f sake.

You also ignored how Navalny condemned the fact it was annexed at all, something which nobody in today's Kremlin would dare to say out loud, and was and is considered a crime of calling for separatism. Navalny is absolutely not fine with it simply "belonging" to Russia. If he wanted it to just remain part of Russia, he'd say it belongs to Russia or not even mention the issue, rather than "risking" losing it.

Also, last I checked, people, including Ukrainians, didn't leave Crimea en masse, since it was occupied peacefully, albeit illegally (AFAIK there was even claimed a large economic growth after that, to bribe the locals, as it was simply pumped away from other Russian regions). You must be thinking of Donbass, where all the major Russian crimes were committed. Suffice to say, the history of Crimea is complex, but the general feeling was that Russians, who were in majority there even before 2014 (keep that in mind) hated Ukraine, but somehow didn't mind at all being within it, as Crimea had a large measure of autonomy, and Ukraine itself was more like a 2nd Russia before 2014.

In the 2023 farm bill, democrats need to raise SNAP an adequate amount to compensate for the end of the Pandemic EBT program made during the December 2022 omnibus. Republicans will obviously oppose that but it needs to be a major public debate if Biden really cares about his goal to end hunger in the U.S. by 2030.

I believe in gun rights but the 2nd Amendment was not meant to cover this type of situation. It was meant so every member of the town or whatever it was, could defend their community from Indian attacks. So everybody in the community I believe, was considered a part of the military. Now, less then 10% of the US population are enlisted in the military right now, a stark change in circumstances from the 1700s. Back then,, it was like 100%. The circumstances that existed during the 2nd Amendment do not exist anymore. It makes little sense to use the 2nd Amendmenr and would rather see it repealed and replaced .

It sat at the lower end of Canadian firearms regulation as a non-restricted firearm and fires an intermediate round. Soft enough to not sore one’s shoulder but still powerful enough to take something down like deer reliably. Simple to use and the semi auto function allows for very rapid follow up shots if needed.
The sks is probably the most popular rifle used for hunting in remote northern indigenous communities.

It’s an old Cold War era military surplus rifle from the Soviet block. It used to be cheap to buy, tho they’re now 3-4x the price tag they used to be. And ammunition is still relatively cheap. So in very poor and remote communities it was the rifle to buy.

I fail to see how a treaty made in the 1730s would allow an indigenous tribe a specific exemption to continue owning firearms some of which come into existence over two centuries after.

DeSantis is going to be the Republican nominee because he’s got all the Trump fascism without any of the Trump baggage. And then, on the age difference alone, he’ll beat Biden in the general.

To the point where literally I’m thinking about placing a $1k bet that he will be the next president. It’s roughly 2:1 odds in betting markets so if fascism wins, at least I profit $2k. And if he doesn’t, I’m out a G but at least we stave off fascism a little longer?

And yet the idiot conservatives re-elected him in a landslide. They don’t give a flying fuck about shit like that. They want him to implement fascist policies for their side and then for him to as snarkily and smugly as possible rub liberals noses in it.

So… dreadful person basically describes any GOP presidential nominee, and he is one of the front runners for that. So yes, if he wins that primary, he absolutely has a shot. I’m not saying he’d definitely win, but in a 2 party system as polarized as it is today, should he be the nominee his chances would be 20% at absolute worst, and those are real, terrifying odds.
I don't think any person needs a religious book in order to improve their personality. There are other methods without the danger to get the urge to kill people that are different, because they inferred it from a religious book.
Religions are the result of stupidity, you guys think that stories from fantasy books are real and go nuts, meanwhile often combined with distrust in science.

Religious people tend to be happier, that's a value, but there are a lot of negative aspects that I experienced in such people, probably mostly because they don't think analytically.

I have heard somewhere that Ignorance is bliss.... perhaps that explains happy religious people. Although, I think they are a bit of Fairweather happy... never personally seen a happy one when things aren't going according to their scriptures. They tend to get all doom and gloom or fighty when that happens.
If you were all wondering like i did how Russia got more ships into the Black Sea for the “sudden surge” to occur ….
This was observed prior to large scale missle attacks from the sea. Another possibility mentioned was that RU could have Intel on another UA drone attack like the one that occurred in Sevastopol last year and are clearing the base.

I assume, since it's been a few weeks since the last massive missile attack, that Russia has been tracking down the last few operable missiles from their stockpile, and then added the 10 or 15 they were able to build since then.
I think the National Review was correct in viewing them as political stunts. One thing to remember is that Trump had long made the press a political enemy to his voters. I think these lawsuits should be viewed through that lens. He had long told his voters that the media was their enemy, and portrayed them in dark terms. I think these lawsuits were never meant to succeed but to gin up his base. They made headlines, and his lawyers appeared on Fox News primetime opinion shows. These lawsuits allowed Trump to tell his base that he is standing up to the media, and bolster his image as a fighter. Its a political gambit.

That said if Republican lip service against Trump's anti-Semitism helps further the schism in the Republican party and divides their base, thus helping them lose future elections, I say have at it.

Like the person who wants out of a relationship freaking out about their partner's poorly combed hair and claiming that's the reason they had to end it.
this is stupid and dangerous. you can one social media app, you set the precedent for others. and if US lawmakers are sooooo concerned with the privacy of Americans being violated, they would ban the entire internet, since everything everywhere here is constantly surveilling and stealing our data. remember Cambridge Analytica and all it did in britain and the US? where was the legislation to ban facebook? this is a horrible bill and a horrible idea. let's not forget calls to ban this are mostly coming from the Right here, who are still mad tiktok teens used it to troll the former president.
I work with this food brand and they sent us a message they got from some guy in the Army who was a huge fan of their stuff. The brand wanted us to look in to military commissaries because this guy said that “all the guys on base love” watching this particular redneck influencer that the brand partners with.

The funniest part to me is how Republicans would literally be tripping over themselves in a heartbeat to nominate this Dr. Dre as their presidential candidate if he came out as conservative in the middle of a string of incidents where he said some very offensive, politically incorrect things. They would become so obnoxious overnight about blasting his music from every diesel-guzzling vehicle in the country, shrieking about how he's a real doctor and Jill Biden is an imposter, etc. (Not that The Chronic wouldn't be a welcome improvement on its own over their current choices.).

Think about it, my good patriot homie: Death is the same number of letters as "white." And Row is the same number of letters as "hat." Thus, Dre and Snoop are clearly engaged in a noble, covert existential battle for the soul of the world against evil East Coast globalists. Or, like others suggest, was '90's hip hop even more malevolent than we thought: a false flag or psy-op in a Cold War between Patriots and the deep state?

They'd all sell their tacky MAGA shit to start trapping and making beats to get rich like their new god hero merely because a top 10 Q-Anon influencer was having a slow week and falling behind on rent, so she made a suggestive video wildly misinterpreting a Dre lyric about getting his dick sucked "liberally" or something, then highlighting his conservative bonafides like being a CEO of a huge company he created, a legacy of homophobic lyrics, and credible accusations of violence against women in public. There would be so many bad Republican thug life videos and memes for a while, many of which would inexplicably and mistakenly use pics of Ice Cube. Conspiracies would abound that Snoop was Q, Death Row was a front for white hat conservative lunatics, and that Eazy-E was going to be reincarnated as JFK Junior.

Interesting historical note: most of you are probably too young to remember this, but conservatives went through a similar phase briefly in the late 90s over a misunderstanding of something Silkk the Shocker said on stage. They were all suddenly sagging their pants and calling Bill Clinton wack.

So true. Conservatives are far too consumed enjoying the supposed irony of "whiny liberals who used to care about things and listen to Rage Against the Machine in the 90s" are now the ones wearing masks and getting vaccinated like over 99% of licensed physicians in the US, effectively transforming themselves into The Man whom they used to hate, according to the science-illiterate moron community.

racism and classism are centuries-old grifts that can always be tapped by those cynical and shitty enough to be willing to. It's the lowest of low-hanging fruit. If people had any sense they'd be in the hangover phase, damning Trump and themselves for falling so easily for it. But that's the beauty of this grift. All you have to do is whip up that hate and fear of the The Other and boom, it reinforces it, concentrates it.

No sentient being would get off a spaceship onto a new planet, look at the public torture and murder of young men that occurred at lynchings in the American past and think "this seems right and good, I'm on board." No one would. It's the most graphic evidence of the power of that grift.

The Texas and Florida democratic parties are a joke . Florida to this day I don’t believe even has a chair. In Texas the national DNC was no help while the GOP raked in millions from outside funds . Here in Texas we ran Beto knowing he wouldn’t win the swing vote due to his gun comments had a failed senate run and a worse presidential run , a AG no one knew , and a Lt gov that already lost twice before . First thing would be to run quality candidates which we haven’t had in Texas for many years. Democrats do very little state wide to get elected , poll closures in areas where democrats are more prone to vote didn’t help either as well as added voter restrictions . To this day there’s really no democrats in Texas with state name recognition. To even remotely be able to challenge the GOP. It goes a lot farther than the people of Texas want to be ruled by Republicans .
There's always the governor race. I know the people of TX and FL want to be ruled by Republicans because they voted for their governors and it was not that close, either. By contrast, the people of WS want to be ruled by Democrats because they voted for their governor, and the Republican legislature there is due to gerrymandering.
To be honest, I would be unhappy if gas stoves were banned. After cooking on electric and gas stoves, I prefer gas. I like being able to instantly apply, change, or remove heat. However, I am not going to waste time making a big deal over it. I can get used to electric again if I have to.

Btw, as to your original implied position (but not explicit, because then it could be refuted and you couldn't play your games) it's not hypocrisy to point out that someone is violating their own rhetoric or values, even if you don't agree with that rhetoric or those values.
\ Edit 2: According to another article by Le Monde and other sources such as Le Figaro and Le Parisien, in 2017 he was sentenced to a six-month suspended prison term, not six years.
It seems that there are two possible dysfunctions with the judiciary system at hand: firstly, a lack of means leading to long delays before trials; secondly, a possible failure of communication between the justice and police regarding his possession of weapons.

The Armenians who continue to commit war crimes themselves and won’t sit the fuck down after losing illegally occupied territories in the Karabakh war? The most dense nation I’ve ever seen tbh.

I don't know why but I have a friend from Armenia who, when the topic of the Kurds came up, remarked, "I hate the Kurds. I hope they all fucking die." Cue a bunch of shocked and stupified Americans looking awkwardly at each other.

That's what the mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo has said through a tweet, but without waiting for proper evidence on the matter. She's a center-left politician from the Socialist Party (social-democratic). The other person talking about the far-right who's mentioned in Forbes' article is Mathilde Panot, a MP from La France Insoumise, a left-wing party leaning towards ecosocialism & democratic socialism).

Denouncing the far-right is par for the course coming from them, but they've been contradicted by the first pieces of information at the hand of Paris' public prosecutor Laure Beccuau. The racist motives are clearly there, but according to French police and justice there's no info yet that he is a far-right activist, and it is still too early to tell if this can be characterised as a terrorist attack.

Because if he shreds the state budget and makes life hell for Reno/Vegas residents, they'll be consequences. Especially with Nevada's long-term goal of stealing Californians or leeching from California's economy, now is not the time to be saying no to new construction projects for California's Teslas and California's trains. Which is the real implication for Reno residents vis-a-vis the attempts to expand Amtrak California service up the mountain.

Welcome to "Nevada is a fucking weird state." New Republican Governor Joe Lombardo spends a good chunk of his State of the State address indulging boilerplate Republican talking points on school choice, election security, and taxes. And then drops this doozy of a budget. Massive spending bumps and public works projects, including a really hefty per pupil spending increase and restoring the higher education system's funding to pre-2020 levels.

Quite a few interesting ones there too, quite a few are claims made by other people about biden that gets checked as false etc. So keep that in mind. Either way, GOP harps on for months about the same issue while we couldn't keep track of trumps daily lies they actively promoted.

Netanyahu, someone who belongs in jail, is leading one of the most right-wing, terroristic governments Israel has ever seen. Opposing these violent, genocidal bigots is an intelligent and rational position.

Yeah pretty much everyone on the planet is threatened by this problem - corrupt, incompetent, fascist-adjacent authoritarians with fragile egos that stoke ethnoreligious tensions, homophobia/transphobia/misogyny and/or ultranationalism in order to cling to power and run their countries into the ground. In places such people haven’t taken control yet, there are powerful movements that seek to install them into government.

Nah dude, I follow it on opposition and independent media all the time. They are actually quite optimistic and keep saying the prosecution is winning, even in the battles the pro Bibi media claims as detrimental to the prosecution, usually there's a legal win that was ignored in the pro Bibi article. As an Israeli lawyer I tend to agree with the "prosecution is winning" narrative, as the legal case is substantial and they are gaining most of their legal goals, but they are suffering great losses in the public opinion battle.

Republicans claim to be the party of freedom, but how can they support individual liberty while telling what people can do with their bodies? Their stance on issues like marijuana legalization suggests otherwise.

Don't get your hopes up, this legislation is so restrictive that not every county will have a dispensary, you need more than a simple prescription, and only about half of the known conditions that medical marijuana treats are covered.
Also I love how anyone that is any type of conservative is automatically a racist or the like on here. Fiscal conservative is a thing. Do I want the government controlling everything hell no do I want them dolling out money to make people dependent and lazy god no. But that’s what people will vote for. Who will give me the most stuff. Welfare is the most racist thing out there. It was geared to make poor( at the time black) families dependent on the government to survive. Also the democrat party is finally being shown as it’s racists roots. Look at Biden super racist his whole life even says this and still people will blindly support him.

Trump genuinely believes regulations are what are keeping American businesses from prospering and building more factories and bringing back old obsolete jobs. After all, rules and regulations kept getting in the way of him doing what he wanted.

Because this is r/politics. Some people will read the first part, scream about it, then think. Others will read the whole thing and think about it. So it’s a win win.
How could they legally lie about that? Thats what I dont understand . How did they get away with that from a legal point of view? Why does nobody ask where that money is?
Second, I don't know, really. I know UK doesn't have the same free speech rights that the US does, but I imagine that people can't really be charged to significantly for just driving a bus around with words on it.

Funny you're oblivious to democracy being under attack around the world. It's already happened in Europe - see Hungary. The US just saw an attempt to overthrow the Constitution. Democracy in Brazil has been under constant attack. None were by left leaning people. Does it happen? Of course. It's just far more likely and is happening with right leaning people.

I'm sorry if that offends you but it's reality. If it were left leaning groups I'd be calling them out. If it's left leaning groups in 50 years I'll call them out. But just look back over the last 4 decades and think about which groups overwhelmingly commit terrorism. Far right lunatics. The manipulation works the same with terrorists as it does with far right authoritarians. It's much easier to radicalize conservative minded people. Just look at history. And it's happening now with conservative minded people.

Remember though, it doesn't matter what you're ideology is when democracy is destroyed. Either way, you and I no longer have a choice in laws, policy, or domestic and foreign affairs.

But that's besides the point. The topic at hand is an authoritarian regime manipulating the populace of other nations to erode support for their democracy, push policies that negatively impact the other nation (Brexit), and sow unrest and dissent.

No, 200+ years isn't a long time in the history of the world. But the context for the statement is important. The US has been democratic for 10 generations. That's a long time. So some western European nations have been democratic for 3 generations. That's a long time. It's all they've known and all their parents knew.

Of course, you can't answer this. So save your "everyone does it" bullshit. Even if that were true, no one is dumb enough to state that the world would be better off with Russian ideologies instead of American ideologies.

Weird you conclude it's far fetched but Boris Johnson's government prevented an inquiry into it then eventually your government was inconclusive while admitting Russian troll farms had been actively putting a significant effort into influencing UK politics.

Really makes you wonder why you're deliberately claiming something that is objectively false and easy to research through a simple Google search. Are you purposely ignorant or deliberately pushing false indignation? It can only be one or the other.

There isn’t enough water in the ice caps to completely submerge all continents, a vast majority of the U.S. and other continents would still have plenty of land… however it would swallow up entire coastal cities and impact the densest areas of population on the planet. It would be an apocalyptic scenario for some regions having to relocate but not a water world. For instance the entire state of Florida would pretty much be swallowed up, but we aren’t looking at living on islands that used to be mountain ranges for most of humanity.

Now the weather patterns and heat issues… that’s a much bigger problem if it’s warm enough for all sea ice to permanently melt.
Unfortunately, due to us not being like the CCP, we can't go kicking in doors and shoving people into unmarked vans whenever we feel like it, need to build a case and pass it to the courts for a warrent and what not. That being said, they can make life difficult for them via these disruptions while they build said case so that it inhibits their operations, kinda the best we got until all is ready to go.
Nearly everything about them is hearsay and rumour, which doesn't stand up well in court. Without clear cases of them breaking Canadian law, there isn't really much that can be done right now other than revoking visas and applying diplomatic pressure to China, and making it difficult to operate.

Yes you can if they are unregistered foreign agents on your soil. You can kill them if you wanted to if they have no diplomatic cover. Spy’s have no protection outside of diplomatic cover. They aren’t uniformed military personnel neither so no Geneva convention protections. Issue is they will arrest and kill random Canadians in China claiming they were non cover agents too.

The main issue is the media has painted it as a clear picture though oversimplification and hearsay, but from a legal and diplomatic standpoint it's actually not very clear at all, which is why we can't just march in and shut them down.
Barely and it actually became part of the problem. Germany's economy was destroyed in the aftermath of WW1 and, when the Nazis took over, they did a lot of stuff to make it look like everything was going great and Germany was on the up and up, but in reality, it was all a sham, most notably the idea that Nazi Germany had an amazingly efficient war machine. In brief, a lot of what the Nazis did was create ways to get more people to do the same amount of work (i.e layers of bureaucracy, kicking Jewish people/other minorities out of jobs, encouraging women to stay at home, etc) and look pretty in front of the camera while doing it. While this can sort of work during peacetime, the Nazis ran into problems once WW2 started because they were never able to ramp up production for the war effort and couldn't really build up new factories and production lines because of layers of bureaucracy and petty infighting amongst the higher-ups. Pretty much, the more they controlled the more it strained their system.

Trump’s latest failure in New York state court shows just how far his lawyers are willing to go to appease the former president—and how much potential professional trouble they are willing to put themselves in.

In their desperate attempts to halt the New York attorney general from dealing a death blow to Donald Trump’s family business, the former president’s lawyers keep shopping the same failed arguments in states across the country. And judges are starting to call his legal team out for its bad-faith delay tactics.

On Friday, a New York state judge refused to dismiss the AG’s $250 million civil case against the Trump Organization for business and tax fraud, saying he was utterly unconvinced by the same lame arguments he’d already shot down.

Trump’s lawyers keep saying that Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat who is New York’s top law enforcement officer, is merely engaged in a political “witch hunt”—and doesn’t even have the legal right to go after the company for its extensive history of simply making up fake real estate valuations.

In May, a state appellate court backed him up when it said “the investigation was lawfully initiated at its outset and well founded.”.

Saudi Arabia tried to influence our midterm elections with the timing on their announcement of the cut in oil production. They were trying to boost a possible red wave because Dems had dared to talk about the Saudis many human rights abuses. They essentially took a shot at the king, and they missed. Yet the Biden admin's response is to do nothing about it?

The Saudis don't give a damn about that. They were just looking out for their own economy, which is petrol based and would be damaged by low oil prices. Which is also why Biden didn't actually do anything, because he knew it as well as I do.

Not 5o mention the price cap on Russian oil. Any increase in production eases dependence on Saudi oil.

Not for their egos, but because pro Iran Houthi militias overthrew the government and waged a brutal civil war against the former government. Since the Saudis hate the Iranian government and were allies of the previous Yemeni government, they intervened.....and got their butts kicked for the same reasons Russia did.

So we helped them bomb the Houthis to dislodge a government that is friendly to Iran, because we aren't fond of the Iranian regime either.
My mother died in 2019 of COPD. She smoked for 20 plus years and it really sucks because my grandpa smoked his entire life and lived till 88 so what the f. She was very active and in the air force walked miles a day. Soo I don't think him smoking really matters. My dumbass also smoked in my twenties and ran a 5K it was doable but it was a lot easier a year later when I quit smoking.

There are a few who put Ukrainian flags on their profile and support Ukraine - but others who either put blithering statements saying Ukraine should seek a 'Russian peace' or just support Putin. I'm still friends with any that support Ukraine, but the others can go get fucked. The worst offenders (that I know are still on Visas) I have reported to the government with screenshots of the hate speech. They are too stupid and just think they can post hate speech and call Ukrainians denigrating names on Facebook/Twitter/Telegram etc. without consequence. Hopefully the relevant Irish/British authorities will kick them out when their visas are up for renewal.

They tried to (illegally) serve my step-father-in-law a conscription notice. He's a 50-something year old lung cancer survivor who was last trained for war for a year under the Soviet Union in the 80s. He was at the DMV.
When I was in high school, we had a young republican's club, and they were all well groomed kids from upper-middle to upper class families who were all conservative leaning. They weren't bad kids or anything(this was in the 90's), and at the time, there wasn't this hyper-racist sentiment running through the republican ranks like we see today. Of the ones that I have heard about since then, the ones that went to college mostly turned liberal sometime in the early 2000's. I don't know of any from that club that didn't go to college.
Wouldn't surprise me. Around the time of the Roe overturn we watched the movie Citizen Ruth from back in the 90s. Burt Reynolds swarmy Christian leader character definitely was grooming his "adopted" son. Some shit never changes.

Europe tries to avoid choosing between China and America - " See this is a complicated issue which stems from the history of Europe being neutral player in the super power great game that America and China are playing at. Europe cannot stand against China due to it's own geostrategic, Political and economic reasons, the History of Europe and China has been one of mutual benefit and Technological, Cultural and Social exchange. Europe cannot just turned it's back on China just because America wants to maintain its stance as the world Hegemon. The difference between China and the US is that one doesn't meddle in our affairs and the other does, But the situation demands we will do as we please for the greater interest of Europe. No we cannot forgoe our economic interests with China especially not after we have sanctioned Russia, We are already at the edge of recession and the Euro has reached parity with the dollar, It has reached PARITY for God sakes. We are not going take sides in a conflict thag we have no horse in. Also we demand 'Baguette' become the 8th wonder of the world, No other food item can become a wonderful of the world if you have an issue with that talk to France andif they respond with "Hon Hon Hon, Moisure Louis the MMMXCVL, No speakes English" Report to Germany they no English, Maybe...

If they’re concerned about trace amounts of the medication getting into the water supply, then they better be ready to try to treat ALL medications the same way, because it isn’t just trace amounts of abortion pills that end up in wastewater….

They do realize that there are a huge number of miscarriages unrelated to abortion pills resulting in tissue being flushed down the toilet every single day, right? A very high number of pregnancies end in miscarriage before 12 weeks and most of the time are completely unknown to have ever existed in the first place, which is why we don’t actually know how often it occurs. But from what we do know, it happens A LOT.

This article was what made me finally realize that GOP voters are genuinely evil, not misguided, and that good faith bipartisanship with them was not just impossible but indefensible. And the knowledge that they only understand violence, and therefore can only be defeated with violence, left me with the grim conclusion that the days of the US as we know it are numbered. I will not be surprised if there is civil war or even balkanization in our near future. Left and right wing ideologies are incompatible so long as they can't even agree on something as basic as human rights, and the moderate majority that care more about personal stability than societal progress are part of the problem.

Gender is a socially constructed thing we base society on which both sexes are supposed to act/think in a certain way. Literally no part of that is sexual. In fact children have a basic concept of who they are as far as their gender is concerned around 4 years old. Sexuality does come later but I promise you that teaching kids it's okay to not be straight won't end society.

Also, in case anybody is questioning why she is asking for this sort of a divorce when she lives in Georgia, it is because the intent of her comments are not made to be taken seriously but rather to inflame those who are living in a red state with a blue capital or a blue state with red rural areas. She and others like her are trying to exacerbate and inflame differences of a political opinion with the intent of inciting a civil war.

"Milk" is a generic category. It can refer to color, texture and function. It is used as a noun, and a verb, in ways that does not involve the lactation of animals. This is how we use language in myriad ways. It's not a special exception for terms that only benefit big corporations.
Context: Ghana is a major gold exporter but the government is a mess. They're in the middle of a major economic crisis and trying to negotiate an IMF bailout.
In this weird niche situation, it makes sense for Ghana to buy things with gold instead of dollars because the government is such a bad risk, they're almost cut off from international finance, and their foreign currency reserves are low.

Which, number one, welcome to the party pal People have been complaining about the lack of a third party app store on iPhones for a dog's age Second of all, there are so many other smartphones out there, and Google Play Store allows far more kinds of content than Apple, so if you really just want Twitter on your phone, go fucking buy one of the hundreds of phones that runs Android!

They just want to yell at trans people on the internet and they'll toss any alleged commitment to free markets or free association the moment that's at risk. They'll dutifully repeat Elon's claim that Apple's 30% cut is "secret" and credulously buy the idea that Apple colludes with Democrats to censor Republicans because they want to yell at trans people on the internet that badly.

What's maddening to me is none of Apple's policies are new. I used to have a 4chan app on my phone. Apple pulled it from the app store because of the terrible rhetoric and various kinds of smut on 4chan. Tumblr purged NSFW content in part because they worried it would get them pulled from the App Store. Parler was pulled because it allowed /pol/-style content and Apple simply doesn't want that kind of content in their app store.

It's a free market (so long as it hurts Democrats), the moment one of the people impacted by it is a right-winger, things like free speech or the free market go out the window!

Democrats could actually learn from this with making sure to stay out front of Fox with factual information. Get out ahead of habitual narratives like crime or immigration. Even when they know Fox doesn't want them.

But now were in the streaming era. So even the Conservative media silo is fractured. So Trump is going to naturally "work the refs" of the Republican primary first. This is inevitable. Even if they come out fully for DeSantis. Its still good strategy to keeped them boxed into certain narratives.

“FoxNews is promoting Ron DeSanctus so hard and so much that there’s not much time left for Real News,” the former president wrote on Truth Social.
The talks were never actually offered. News reporters asked Biden if he was having talks with Russia and he just said that the US was not talking to Russia unless Russia pulled out.
That's not what this article says. Putin just has to indicate interest in leaving Ukraine for talks to proceed.

Nobody is talking to either party right now. It’s not even on the table. There are no offers to turn down by either party.

Yes, he’d want to talk if Putin wants to end the war by pulling out of Ukraine. I read the interview last Thursday when it happened. There is more to that interview. I’ll see if I can find it and I’ll edit this post.

Toward the end to where Biden says “There's one way for this war to end, the rational way: Putin could pull out of Ukraine, No. 1. It appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy prince for failing to do it.".

So the only way for Biden to want to talk to Putin is if Putin intends to end the war by pulling out of ukraine.

Another part of the interview Biden stated “There's one way for this war to end, the rational way: Putin could pull out of Ukraine, No. 1. It appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy prince for failing to do it." So he’s only willing to talk to Putin if Putin intends to leave Ukraine.
I get you. My mood is dark too. Because of we know how Moore will go no American has the right to vote anymore our voices have been silenced, and as a woman that upsets me. I am not allowed to seek abortion if I need it, if I vote my voice means nothing, and next in the SCOTUS checklist of how to ruin people’s lives more, I am calling it in 2024, if Republicans win and goes into 2026 it is bye bye to my rights to own/rent my own property, have bank accounts and my own credit cards without men co signing, drive because they will find a way to rule that women aren’t stable enough to drive because they will do anything to imprison women to the kitchen again, which I am more likely to be because when they take away birth control and make it illegal, I have debilitating cramps that make it impossible for me to things on my period, and work, they will start kicking out women when they get pregnant, or even take it a step further and deem women of reproductive age unable to work because we will be seen as pre pregnant no matter what, my life as a woman is over in this country.
Conservative lawmakers also intentionally create unconstitutional or marginal laws in order to decide an issue. That's how we ended up with Roe being overturned.

Because of this NOWHERE in the occupied territories is now safe for Russians and their supplies. Every single one of them can now be targeted at any point.

Ukraine also has a well trained (by west) and heavily present partisan movement behind enemy lines. They pass coordinates to strategic buildings (soldier hotels, ammo depots, heavily guarded places) to long range artillery which takes them out swiftly. Nobody wants to be in those places now, especially high ranking people and politicians.
This is much much much worse, it has a 53% mortality rate If this got loose in a city in human transmissible form we'd be in a post apocalyptic world in a year.
Problem being if it is 53% doctor nurses etc will stop working quite quick, as a way to triage the spread.

It's not human transmissible yet. If it did get into a city I see them basically doing some zombie apocalypse shit and killing anyone trying to leave. It would be the end of the world as we know it.

Nobody could work to earn money. Society would collapse because production of food and other goods would end and desperate people would turn to criminal behavior to survive. Rural areas would be flooded with city dwellers trying to find food and places to hunt/gather etc. leading to more crimes like murder to protect your own food sources, homes, and property.

Not trying to make light of the situation, but some strains of avian flu can cause rapid shifts of lethargy and mania, the sort of mania that involves attacking anything that comes near them. The mania comes from mild brain swelling that occurs in certain strains. This one seems no different, though so far the human cases have not shown such mania. But if we’re not careful and unlucky enough to start exhibiting such symptoms in human patients, we may essentially end up in a ‘zombie’ scenario.

They'd have to have quarantine camps and say someone's kid was sick, those parents would try to protect them and keep them at home and in the process cause the spread to worsen. Nobody would want to be near anyone sick, not even some doctors, so it would be difficult for the infected to get food and supplies without infecting others.

If the fines only cover the cost of fixing the issues, companies will still be incentivized to do whatever they want to people and the environment as long as they can afford the cleanup if they get caught. The penalties should be the thing that detracts them from doing shitty things. If the fines are so absurd that they can't possibly pass it on to the consumer because none of their customers would pay such high amounts for their product, then that would deter companies from breaking regulations. The only thing they care about is their bottom line and these ridiculously little penalties are just going to perpetuate this cycle.

No. Robbers want quick, easy and no trouble. Think about it. You think people actually break in to homes where people are asleep anymore? Oh hell no. And with the amount of doorbell cameras, wifi cameras, fucking cameras the look like the head of a screw, there simply isn't as much crime as the used to be. You don't have anything to be scared of. Not really. The odds are so low bookies would laugh at you. Plus, most robberies these days happen during the day, while you're at work. then they can steal your gun too!
What these gun nuts so scared of? I don't own a gun and I'm not scared to be in my house at night. Crimes rates are going down, everywhere. Stop being such wimps. Fight intruders hand to hand like an adult.

I'm all for EVs but this literally only hurts poor people. Fuck policies like this. Figure out how to put the burden of financial responsibility on those that caused this, not the people struggling to get by as is.
Nobody says you have to dispose of your car, just that you won't enter the city center..seems reasonable and some cities already do that. You'll still be able to drive your car, disposing of property working cars would be idiotic and nobody in their right mind (i hope) should suggest.

In France they did a scrappage program in 2009, where they’d pay you to get rid of your old car and buy a new one. Supposedly because the new one pollute less.

Yeah. Also I don’t think that disposing of a properly working car to manufacture a new EV has such a great impact on the environment... Especially since Poland’s electricity is 83% fossil fuel….

But in the end, people with functional cars will be forced to buy new cars, so theres a forced demand for car manufacturing, which is not good for the environment I guess?

The US did something similar around the same time. It was partly for environmental reasons and partly economic due to the recession. I know here it initially looked like a massive success, but ended up actually being a disastet.

At the same time, the plan would raise the age at which Medicare kicks in, which is still 65, to match the Social Security age. Given the Social Security proposal, this means delaying Medicare eligibility by five years, to the age of 70, and possibly delaying it even further in the future. Jesus.

Are you trying to count interest from the fund? You can’t balance the budget with that if the fund is being depleted because the interest goes away. Even if you did balance the budget with that, COLA is the highest it has been in decades, inflation fast outpacing the meager interest. We need a self-sustaining SSA and the only way to do that is to take in as much money as it disburses.

Not to mention that SS comes from a legally mandated separate fund distinct from the general budget. But then we’re leaving basic mathematical literacy and moving into an understanding of US government and that’s for next class.

Again, basic mathematical literacy would be so nice. SS disburses that much every year. So the deficit would still grow every year. The savings would still be just under 4% for the cost of an enormous amount of soft power.

I absolutely agree with you that the military budget of $773 billion is incredibly bloated and should be cut. And to make up the deficit in SS, we just need to cut it by 37.8%. Good luck with that.

They had lots of flammable material, and it was likely an accident. There's some speculation that there was a birthday celebration (with lit candles) for the people living there, though I'm not sure if it's confirmed to be what started it.

Palestinian Authority-controlled WAFA reported that "scores" of casualties were evacuated from the burning building to a nearby hospital, with the number of casualties likely to increase. Seven children were reported to have died in the fire, according to Israeli reports.

Footage circulated on social media and witnesses said the whole residential building caught fire in a refugee camp in the strip's North, sending flames and smoke from the site. Witnesses said they could hear screaming but they could not reach the victims to offer help because of the intensity of the fire.

Majority of women getting abortions already have at least one child (60% according to the CDC). Places with abortion bans also have the highest maternal and infant mortality. Not to mention the children that will be without a mother if anything happens to her.

We literally moved our family out of Texas this summer over this. I recognize that I'm fortunate enough to have the means to do that. For everyone who doesn't, I hope the electorate can do enough to help get Texas' head out of its ass.

This is our plan, too. Thankfully made it through a healthy but higher risk pregnancy and delivery this year before the “heartbeat bill” took place. But we will not continue to grow or raise our family in the state Texas has become - and will become if the GOP wins this one again. I refuse to be in a situation where my or anyone else’s pregnancy is anyone else’s decision but my or their own.
They only got a 5 vote majority during a midterm with an unpopular sitting president. A presidential election cycle should be a clean up for democrats unless the GOP actually finds someone who is generally electable. As much as they love DeSantis he isn’t actually popular. He has a 38% national approval rating and a 35% disapproval with 26% saying they don’t know. The I don’t knows are probably more likely to disapprove since if you’re the kind of person who would like him you already know who he is. Republicans are looking for ANYONE other than trump who could win a primary where their real concern should be who will win a general election. We’ve already seen that their current messaging is unpopular so unless they change it or find a great candidate they’re gonna get crushed in 2024, especially as more boomers pass away with time and more Zoomers become eligible to vote.

The federal government made a deal with RWE: RWE is allowed to mine the coal sitting underneath the village, but instead of phasing out coal all together by 2038 they have to phase it out in 2030. Why are the protesters still pissed you ask? On the one hand Some studies suggest coal would have been unlucrative by 2030 anyway due to cost of the european CO2 emissions certificates trade, so RWE got the government fooled and is making quite some profit off of that. On the other hand some estimate the amount of coal around the village is almost as high as underneath it, so if RWE would mine that instead the village could be preserved.
They phased out coal and nuclear in order to instead use natural gas. With the current war going on, they stopped buying Russian gas, but still have to get their energy from somewhere.

Even if they changed direction and wanted to focus on nuclear again that would still take a long time to get going and many industries aren't geared towards using electricity for their production needs.

small protests over coal mining in one town are easier to quell than large protests over high energy prices in every town.
I lived in a trapezoid shaped apartment and had 18 square meters and no hot water in Barcelona. Shit is fucked in the cities and the city is so goddamn corrupt it refuses to kick out squatters and clamp down on illegal shit.
I lived in an 25m² apartment for a little over a year. Together with a girlfriend aswell. It had some issues that you kind of got used to manage, constant cleaning was needed, way more than a larger apartment.

As they should. 18 square meters is an absolute disgrace and it definitely shouldn't be called an "apartment". That's roughly twice the space of a 1 star hotel room for 1 person. Developers are free to join two such constructions into one if they want these to be certified.

Edit: apparently you cant just take 25 meters and directly convert that to feet. Oops. I should have said 5m by 5m is roughly 16 feet by 16 feet - which is actually a decent size.

I just assumed it at this level the bathroom and kitchen would have to be in shared space and not in the rooms themselves. But yeah, if those have to be in hat 10x8 then it’s even worse than I thought.
Its not to hide that they got killed. It's simply to do exactly the same as the mafia saying "Real nice shop you have. It wold be a shame if something happened to it..".
They didn't say they killed him. But if you happen to be in a position where you consider bailing out on Putin. You know exactly what kind of accident you are going to face..

The problem is steering your life towards that career path in the first place. They likely have standard meetings on those floors. One day, the elevator opens to several KGB or whoever and you're hit with a stun gun or something.

Ironically, when I was last in Russia, the window at my accommodation (Soviet-era apartments) was so badly made that you could see many warps in the glass from manufacturing. Sub-standard glue wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. It's not what happened here (obvs.), but low quality products aren't uncommon.

This narative that they’re throwing their own higher ups out the window is funny at this point. Maybe NATO spies are doing this and they’re not getting any credit .

Just to be clear, this is a hearing to see if he can practice law in DC again. Its not a criminal procedure, it's to see if he can continue working as a lawyer, per the dc bar. He already is prohibited from working as a lawyer in ny.
Clearly you dont know shit and talking out of your ass. This is TTP Taliban and they are different from the one in Afghanistan. Regardless, The Taliban in Afghanistan changed their plan, they realized attacking US wont let them win the war, so they accepted a deal with Trump and didnt attack US soldiers. Even when Biden came to power and attacked the Taliban, they remained patient because they know it was only matter of time. Taliban is not ISIS or Al Qaeda, their goal doesn't stretch passed Afghanistan. US doesn't care for Taliban as long as they dont host AL Queda and Taliban is a threat for US for US to start another war. US will take the L and move on from Taliban chapter and Taliban isn't stupid to attack US and bring them back to Afghanistan.
Extremists usually call for cease fire when they lose men and equipment. Once they have reorganized their forces they break cease fire and continue this cycle until they are all either killed or they have won.

Not just extremists, every single forces that has ever walked across done that. Also read the article next time ? They ended ceasefire because their commanders started getting killed.

Stoking anger and outrage over manufactured topics might work for some people in the short term, but in order to be a going concern, actual policies and political vision is going to be needed. The larger concern here is the corrosive effect that this anger and outrage has on the broader cultural discourse. Even though those engaging in these actions may eventually be voted out of office, the damage will linger for years to come.

Try attending your local school board meeting, guaranteed they will spend a not insignificant amount of time trying to explain to some looney parent(s) that their 6-year old isn't being taught CRT, or whatever nonsense was on tucker the night before.

Unfortunately we live with his conservative boomer father who thinks its because he doesn't want a job. The other jobs either require a degree which he technically earned but wasn't given(the professor made the news when it came out she was purposely failing male students even though they passed their exams), or the rest are minimum wage jobs which won't even hire him because he has to explain what hes been doing for the past few years which is a long explanation that they refuse to listen too.

Every state has thresholds that have to be met before they release data on their own counts. NV just adds a rule that they release NO results publicly until the count is totally completed, where as most states release information bit by bit.

Moat states technically aren't done all together for a week or so after the votes are cast, you just get results early in chunks, and conclusions can be drawn with enough of those chunks.
Really. Like when they wouldn’t vote on a Supreme Court nominee and held of long enough to pack the court. As far as I’m concerned both sides right now have extremist that tend to b all they talk about in the news and I think the vast majority of people are in the middle. Sick of both parties at this point. Finger pointing and division is killing us. Love thy neighbor. This is not a red or blue problem. Can’t agree on anything. Red. Drill more oil. Blue. Climate catastrophe. We are going to die if things don’t change. Red. No immigration. Blue. Let them come legal or not. Not once have I heard a proposal about a Ellis island type of thing like we used to have for immigration. If you can’t stop it then control it at the least or debate it until it’s resolved. Everyone in this country is getting taken for a ride on both side of it and it benefits the parties and politicians by drawing lines. Enough is enough. I was raised very liberal and I now work construction and it’s very conservative mind set on job sites. When it comes to problems at work we have no problem working through the issues to find resolve. As soon as it comes to politics everything changes all of a sudden. Pick a team and stick with it to the end right or wrong. Political parties need to be dissolved so issues that arise are dealt with by addressing the problems and not along party loyalty ☹️.

You’ll have to wait until she fails to get re-elected and needs money because her pedophile husband lost his “job” he has no training, education, or experience for that he somehow got after she was elected.

Jesus himself told his followers over and over to ease up on the prayers (eliminating long, rambling prayers, public prayers, etc) and actually do shit to help people. But again, Christians don’t want to hear that. At least they didn’t for the 10 years I was a pastor and read those passages.

"That report found that the Internal Revenue Service started a mandatory audit for only one of the former president’s tax returns during his administration, during 2016. The report also stated that he made large sums of money sent to his children that could actually be gifts but were designated as loans to avoid a gift tax.

Trump made zero charitable contributions in his final year as president. The former president’s lack of charitable donations with his own money became a sourcey of scrutiny during his 2016 presidential campaign. At the same time, when Mr Trump ran for president, he said he would donate his presidential salary to charity. But in 2020, the former president did not give any money to charity in 2020.

Just to play devils advocate for a second. For anyone who does not know about international travel by state aircraft, the same freedom of navigation rules applied to civilian aircraft are not applied to state aircraft. In order to fly over a sovereign nation you have to get a diplomatic clearance, usually granted from a government body similar to the department of state. These “dips” can be used to either cover a specific entry/exit time or provide a lenh of time like -24/+72 from expected entry time. Every country has a specific process and lead time for dips. It could be automatic if the countries have good relations or it could be a firm 14 days. It depends. I don’t know how Pakistan deals with its dips normally and if there is a precedent for them not allowing immediate dips. I’m not saying whether it’s correct or not but the article provides very little information surrounding why the dips were denied.
It has 0 sources or quotes from anything to support this headline. After the first 3 sentences, they don’t even mention the topic headline again. There’s a 95% chance this is all fake news.

Right now, the speeches are just an opportunity for some grandstanding for C-SPAN, and since they’re all stuck waiting on the House floor, there’s a lot of speaking time to try and fill. If they’re lucky, they might see a clip go viral on social media. That’s the goal, not a futile effort to persuade people to support McCarthy.

Does anyone honestly think these people are going to persuade the lunatics who are holding out against McCarthy? Nothing they say matters, and given how extreme the concessions McCarthy already offered the lunatics were, nothing he says matters.

Hi bropakote. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
“I have, and despite being the healthiest, most physically fit and mentally stable president ever, more than Lincoln, more than Washinon, but I have the worst heels. We didn’t want to disclose that unlike Sleepy Joe, guy can’t even stay awake I mean it’s like ‘come on, wake up Joe’ But anyway the doctor felt bad telling me this because I’m so healthy and strong and he held my very large hands, and told me ‘Donald, I don’t know how you’ve managed your whole life with these, there’s so many spurs, I thought it was San Antonio, or even the 1800’s’ he said, he just couldn’t believe that I had made it this far with the worst heels he’s ever seen, worse than Achilles, possibly the worst heels of all time. But I told him, I said “what about Hillary’s emails, you know you should look into that, do your research, they should lock her up” And anyway, any time I felt my heels hurt, I just thought about it and despurred them and went about my day.”.

I think it becomes even more obvious when you look at right-wing media and hosts like Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity at Fox News or even to Infowars Alex Jones. They formed 'characters' to best appeal and build-up the bases they were making money off of and try to 'maintain' the appearance of really being that even when if you begin to look at their 'real life' you would see just how different they are, see their kids going to elite 'leftist' private schools, etc...

I've been reading up on the Dominion Brief and it's amazing how high Fox's legal risks are, and how it documents the kayfabe and their support of it. For many of them I think it gets very hazy where kayfabe and crazy cross over. It has a lot in common with “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”.

Edit: If you have the time a couple of days ago that's worth the watch. If there was ever a case that Fox could lose on 1st Amendement, this is it.

Weirdly several states GOP embraced mail in voting, but now that they're seeing that it hurts them they are starting to roll it back. Same with Ranked Choice, they no longer support legislation for the public good, just to further their own control.

I'm not sure I completely agree with that framing. I think the GOP lost control of itself when it decided to not be reality based, things like trickle down economics etc and their voters got comfortable being outside a reality based world view. Fox just dialed that up to 11, but the Brief documents how even they know they only have the tiger (GOP voters) by the tail and risk losing viewer/money by trying to inject reality into their reporting.

Edit: Just to add a data point to about the crazy, there's conspiracy theory spinning right now that the whole Rus/Ukr war is fake because they aren't seeing any evidence when their media bubble is designed not to provide it.

It's hard to say what sets of their voters cognitive dissonance, considering this was such a big part of the Big Lie it might just be a mess with both their voters and state parties.

It still surprises me they leaned against mail voting so hard, it really doesn't hurt the regular chances, Trump and the GOP was just so heavily disliked in 2020 but not sure if the state GOP's will figure that out before rolling back the mail.

That's why I keep coming back to reaganomics as a turning point. Even Bush Sr called it "Voodoo Economics" because they did have many more reality based pols back then, what's changed is decades of pols who grew up drinking that koolaid and never allowing themselves to question it.

One of the things that didn't keep me interested in wrestling while growing up was I never got the appeal of Heals, and that's what Fox and GOP specialize in. "Cheap Heat" is a good term for it.
I was in Santeram a few months back and I noticed a guy with a young wife. They both had a lot of gold jewellery around their necks. Friend told me he must be in charge of a gold mine somewhere Para/Amazonia.

He has said several times that the indigenous groups should have been exterminated. He said that during the dictatorship, the military were incompetent and they should have killed all the natives. He’s not afraid of saying that type of shit. Every single decisions aimed at the natives were focused at harming them. This is 100% an intentional genocide (the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group).

Form a new NATO of every other country that is sane in the alliance and focus on that, let Turkey, Hungry, etc apply to that, disband the original NATO.
Just let the US, UK, France, Germany sign bilateral agreements with them so that they can tell Turkey they won't be getting a damn thing and stand up to the non-democratic bullshit there.

Fact is Russian oil was irrelevant for Europe all the time. Oil is very easy to transport. What would really hurt Russia is a price cap and the ban of gas. In the contrary to oil, gas is much more difficult to transport it without pipelines.
Germany on Wednesday shrugged off Russia’s ban on oil sales to countries and companies that comply with a price cap agreed by Western allies, saying it has “no practical significance.”.

Yeah Russia overplayed their hand hard and too early. Well they didn't really have much. The West was much smarter rolling out the sanctions bits at a time, gradually increasing pressure. Russia has nothing left to squeeze.

Yup; republicans have been cozying up to these kind of extremist beliefs for decades and dogwhistling to them. Trump did it pretty openly, but it's been going on for a long time.

I have very seldom heard much politics at all in a mass, and have gone for years. Very occasionally you hear about abortion, but that has been it, and most times it was mentioned, no party or candidate was attached to it. I'm pretty liberal and would notice if it was common. Bishops, however, can get pretty annoying if you start to read their comments....

Also the American government seems to know its trajectory across not jus the USA but the entire world. Remembering how relatively small the balloon is, it's kinda incredible that we can quite easily and quickly spot them.

I don't think the US has EMP weapons able to prevent this, but I remember hearing about jamming and other electronic warfare systems we had. Would definitely be interesting to know exactly what they are doing but I wouldn't be surprised if the systems they are using are classified.

Convince the MAGA conspiracy theorists that Desantis ordered a hit on Trump. Guarantee they believe that rather than burgers and diet coke killing their cult leader.

Blasphemous as it sounds, I kind of enjoy "healthy" Trump alive and well to ruin the GoP. Not that the GoP does anything for Americans to rise up in arms for them. Just makes it easier when right wingers are divided. His position as a political pariah is advantageous.
The World Bank president, David Malpass, has announced his resignation after sparking controversy for failing to say whether he accepted that fossil fuels were driving the climate crisis. Malpass, who was appointed to the post by Donald Trump in 2019, said he would step down from the multilateral development bank by the end of June and offered no specific reason for the decision. The incident re-ignited calls for a leadership shake-up at the bank, where pressure has been building to make changes and ensure it responded to the climate crisis more aggressively. US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, has launched a major push to change the way the World Bank operates to ensure broader lending to combat the climate crisis and other global challenges. Yellen issued a statement thanking Malpass for his service. The US will soon nominate a replacement for Malpass and the bank’s board will undertake a “transparent, merit-based and swift nomination process for the next World Bank president”.
>Malpass previously served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under Donald Trump, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under George H. W. Bush. He served as Chief Economist at Bear Stearns for the six years preceding its collapse.

> U.S. military leaders’ faith in Washinon-to-Beijing hotlines as a way to defuse flare-ups with China’s military has been butting up against a sharply different take — a Chinese political system that runs on slow deliberative consultation by political leaders and makes no room for individually directed, real-time talk between rival generals.

Authoritarian/Totalitarian governments certainly act like petulant children that aren't mature enough to cope, and deal with problems in a logical manner.
Yeah, this is genuinely confusing. They may actually have found one of the few foreign policy points where US interference might actually lead to a lower chance of war.
This isn't to say the US is or should be meddling with the LAC, just not sure how their involvement would make the situation worse.

Jokes aside, even India has been very insistent over the years that their dealings with China should be kept purely bilateral. Neither of them want anyone else (especially America) coming in because both are wary of foreign interference. Seems India might be slightly shifting their stance a bit since quad is a thing, but from what I understand India is still one of the least active members.

China wants to fight India like so bad...from the Chinese point of view it's a pretty safe fight China gets to flex it military at a long standing enemy.

I strongly think China would get it's teeth kicked In by an Angry India but from China's point view this is absolutely someone they want to scrap with.

Interesting - however, IIRC it was China that ultimately backed off in the 2017 confrontation when India showed it was ready to go to war even if it meant losing. China thought India would just cave. A potential alliance between India and other countries (something India has typically rejected since independence due to its non-alignment and desire to be unencumbered in foreign policy) would really threaten China. That’s why the Quad (US + Japan + Aus + Hopefully India) is so important, and should be the US priority in the region.

They just want to consolidate their hold on that border and think that being aggressive with India is the best way of achieving that cos apparently the current guys in charge are brutes who think that burning bridges somehow isn't going to hurt them further down the line. Whether it's because they think too little of India or because they've somehow got a functioning strategy, o really can't tell. I think they're dumb as rocks personally, but hey, I'm not the one running that country.

Maybe, but the Galwan valley incident happened in 2020, way before the current Ukraine conflict and Russia's reduced standing. I'm pretty sure they're aware of how hard a Himalayan conflict would be as well, and honestly I still don't even know what the result of the earlier skirmish at Galwan was. According to India they killed more Chinese soldiers while according to the Chinese side they killed more Indians. I'm slightly more inclined to believe India, but it's not as though India's government isn't also pretty nationalist - but at the very least they gave us numbers, unlike the Chinese government refusing to even do that. If what India says is true, I would think the Chinese wouldn't be dumb enough to make an even bigger push on that front now.

I honestly don't know what the Chinese government thinks anymore. I can agree that what you're saying is generally the vibe I get from them, and it's also true that fascist governments do typically think and behave irrationally, but I don't know just how much of a break Xi Jinping is from previous administrations. You would hardly have expected this kind of thing from Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao, and the idea that a weird fascist authoritarian whose only conception of foreign policy is grandstanding could climb his way up a bureaucracy like the CCP is kinda mindblowing to me.

On the other side you have the pro money side who demand China effectively take over local geographic area and build a mini empire usa style so they can rince it like they feel the USA and eroupe does, they are currently upset XI effectively blew up the enconmy.

A Limited border conflict is very likely as India also has nukes both sides know they can't use them meaning a conventional fight is more likely not less.

On 1962, also note that China’s 1962 invasion took India completely by surprise. The CCP (in a move right out of Hitler’s playbook) had signed a peace treaty and mutual non-aggression pact with India in 1954. India’s govt. — being colossally stupid and naive IMO — actually thought China would never attack it, given the countries’ shared professions of Sino-Indian friendship and distaste of colonial rule. Indian soldiers were completely unprepared and basically sitting ducks for the invading Chinese. I doubt India would make that mistake with China again.

Bruh. We then occupied a defeated Japan and (successfully) molded it in an image that was acceptable to us. That went a long way in the “close alliance” today.

Bro what? That makes no sense, they don't want to fight India. The last thing they want is a war on their already-unstable western border. They're already super anxious about India hosting the Dalai lama.

IIRC, that’s always consistently been India’s stance, though. It doesn’t want internationalization of any of its disputes and sticks to the “bilateral” route. But I think China’s constant provocations and territory grabs (it has territorial disputes with EIGHTEEN countries, for crying out land) have made at least a superficial cozying up to Japan/Aus/the U.S. tactically desirable for India. The U.S should (subtly and in private) push that advantage.

Yes, but China also claims international waters as its territory. The fact is that when you have specious and completely arbitrary territorial “claims” on 18 other countries’ legal domains, you are the problem. China’s alleged territorial disputes with India and Bhutan are complete hogwash, and simply a cover for the CCP’s broader hegemonic designs and unwarranted aggression.
The more impoverished and the more religious the country the more likely they don’t buy into any progressive views. If you’re impoverished and religious … gg.
you made the most intelligent comment in this entire thread so succinctly! i'm gay and i live and work in Yemen. my national colleagues talk añl the time about how the Saudis are pushing extreme versions of Islam incessantly across Yemen (and much of the Middle East and North Africa) and they lament how just a few decades ago women dressed colorfully and could walk around in long skirts. The average Yemeni is not hyper-religious and the current civil war really has nothing to do with religion, and is more of a power/land grab by the Houthis, Saudis, UAE, Qatar and Iran to control major shipping routes and some oil deposits. I'm not super out at work, but some of my colleagues certainly know, and i work with one gay national guy who the women will take their hijabs off around when they are in private (technically a big no-no, but shows they accept him for what he is and dont see him as a threat). Of course there is a ton of sexism and homophobia, but I don't think Yemen would be anywhere like it is now without Saudi Arabia's relentless influence.

The bill doesn't mention "Arabs" anywhere. Those who are CONVICTED of terrorism AND paid a stipend by the Palestinian Authority will lose Israeli citizenship and be deported to PA territories. In theory this includes any terrorists who are Jewish or Christians would be subject to the exact same law, but it's unlikely anyone not Muslim would be getting payments from the PA in the first place, so...
Can confirm. I live in a solidly blue state and a blue leaning district(which was solidly blue before the redistricting), before I wasn't sure if I was gonna bother voting this year, didn't see much point since blue is nearly guaranteed here anyways. After Roe though, I wasn't taking any chances.

In my defense, I was only considering it this year because I was really not doing great mentally a few months back and the effort involved(little as it was) just seemed too much to bother for how little my 1 ballot would actually help. Still not doing great tbh but I had to do my part for women's rights on principle even if my part didn't really affect anything.

Hi MioNamo. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
Well problem is that there are concerns it probably has more asbestos then Brazil reported and what is reported is high. it sat to close to nuclear testing ships under the French and probably has a fallout problem and partially radioactive, has already had a major fire and scrap metal from the ship is currently on the tug that has to drag it. And sitting without maintenance and upkeep for about 4 years has it falling apart and actively taking on water. Repairs are far beyond capable unfortunately. It’s only value is scrap but the metal itself is possible so harmful that the cost of Protections needed for the workers and decontamination of the metal would probably outweigh the value of the scrap.
The minister of enviroment he hired is asking the military not to do it, the military, who never really cared about the enviroment is the one who want to sink it. I agree that the military shouldn't be able to make that choice, but that's how it is here.

I think this is standard operating procedure. Deny deny Denys and then deny some more. Even Murica does this.. according to the McNamara doctrine The funny thing is that they want public credit, based on this article, which is counterintuitive, given the fact that in military circles it’s undeniable . But since their drones are used by NGO’s maybe they want commercial clients with this horn tooting exercise. I would definitely consider their tech, it’s as close to sn open source drone we will get.(I remember reading that it has car parts and washing machine tech and the engines can be mounted in tandem).

There are NGOs using kamikaze drones? Aren’t NGOs normally things like Doctors Without Borders? What kind of NGO uses drones that are designed to blow stuff up?

I’m actually thinking, were it not politically detrimental, these drones could be deployed to central americ to deter cesna filled with Colombian cargo in clandestine runways. You could circle them in 100 mile radius in loiter mode and redirect once a target is acquired. You could also program a fail safe mechanism which makes detonation impossible below 8,000 ft. I don’t think the Colombian pilots would want to play “battleship” with these loitering drones! These drones could pull double duty serving as eye in the sky and reconnaissance for police and highway patrol.

Yeah and that dude flat out told the judge that if he saw someone from his own party doing what he did he wouldn't have a problem with it but if a democrat did it he would.

In all seriousness, who didn’t expect this? This is the new republican playbook. Hell even conservatives didn’t like slavery being outlawed they started a civil war. Its tradition in this country for the conservatives to threaten the nation’s existence when civil rights move too fast for them.
The whole "water will freeze at 0C" is only true for "normal" water (not pure water) at atmospherical pressure. We don't know if that river is under an heavier pressure than atmospherical or not or if the water is saline or not. I just assumed that the water is, at least, saline. I might be wrong.
How do you suppose that it's liquid? Higher pressure and temperature below 0C would indicate that it's probably frozen. Maybe it's saline?

If it's saline, it can definitely be in liquid state below 0C. If it's under pressure, even more. Water won't freeze as easily when put under a certain amount of pressure.

From what I've read, these rivers form due to geothermal heating and friction. Since that's the case, this sort of thing has probably been going on for quite some time. So I doubt it's saline.

You did said that higher pressure would indicate that it's frozen, which is not true. Anyway, the fact is, we don't know yet. My assumption is just that, an assumption. Like, if I had to bet 10 bucks, I'd bet them on liquid below zero C, that's it. (also, that wouldn't be a river if it was solid ice anyway).

Hillary Clinton supporters are goading Donald Trump after he withdrew a $250m lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James, which followed a warning from a federal judge regarding a lawsuit against his 2016 opponent and other officials.In a short filing on Friday morning, the Trump legal team withdrew the filing with US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks after his Thursday warning.“Plaintiff, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, by and through his undersigned counsel and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i), hereby voluntarily dismisses his claims in this action against Defendant, LETITIA JAMES, without prejudice,” the letter to the judge said.
I try to inform these rural Texas who spout about “their tax money” that they’re not even coming close to paying their own way, and wouldn’t have electricity, phones, internet, paved roads, etc. if it weren’t for the blue cities in Texas and blue states in the US subsidizing the hell out of them. They either don’t believe indisputable reality even with sources proving I’m right, or they come back with “what would the cities do without food, huh?” Well, we have money and hence can buy food from elsewhere if we had to. And we’d have a lot more money if our taxes weren’t paying their bills plus our own.
State Rep. Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, filed House Bill 714 and House Joint Resolution 50 last week that would create a new “District of Austin” to replace Texas’ capital.

So they want to take away all elected officials of one of the biggest citys in Tx so they can control it with people who are elected by people who dont live there, essentially taking away and voting power the people of Austin have.

Because the GOP is trying to turn the country into a religious dictatorship and they think, mistakenly in my opinion, that they will get to be part of the in-group.

The FBI is mostly populated by conservative white men. In fact, there's even a large number of Mormons there, because it's easier for them to pass the background checks (no drinking, drugs, gambling, etc).

I have a genuine honest question. I'm not from the US. If I was from the US, I would definitely support the Democrat party. With that being said, it doesn't make sense to me that there are claims that the FBI like Trump, when Trump was the one to fire like two leaders of the FBI.

Again, I'm not from the US, so I just want to understand the whole situation more because it seems confusing to me.

Oh okay that's quite interesting. This was during the 2016 election right? And I'm guessing Comey said Hillary was under investigation because of the whole email thing, but he didn't mention Trump's Russian collusion links?

There was that Comey guy and I think someone else? I'm not sure about the exact details, but it seems counter-intuitive to me. Surely there's some other reason at play here?

Their press release was basically "It was 2 documents in a box of a thousand. And when we gave them to an intern to copy, she did not notice the markings, as she took pictures with her personal phone, and sent them to a laptop.".

I mean, it's all bullshit excuses. Like Trump can mentally un-classify all the docs. Except he obviously had no clue what he had even taken at the time.

Why would he resign? It’s unlikely he’s going to face serious repercussions from this, maybe a small fine that will be paid by the GOP to ensure he’s a good boi who’s very quiet and votes as he’s told to.

I read Bolton’s book and watch his commentary a lot, he’s very anti-trump and takes every opportunity he can to explain that Trump is incompetent, a liar, and unfit for office. Why would he take votes from Trump?

nobody loves a Woman more than me! and I have much better words, Greater Words than Little Michael Bolton ok, I won a lot of Grammys and other Incredible Awards, but it was covered up by the Fake News Media because they don't want to admit that I'm good at so many things, believe me.

No don't be so sure. A hard and heavy part of Trump's base is weird hawkish people who hate some foreign country. Foreign policy nationalism is pretty much Bolton's reason for existing.

Visited my dad a couple times, and his room had to be accessed through the ER, and 5 of the 6 days it looked like a world war 1 field hospital with people slumped over coughing, kids crying and all sorts of chaos.
The number of total cases has become meaningless what is relevant is vaccinated against unvacinated cases and how full we are on hospital beds those are the numbers we should be concerned about. At some point we have to go back to how it was. we have to let covid become endemic because what is the alternative? Lock downs forever? At some point the pandemic has to be over.

I mean its fairly pointless you don't need masks to visit restaurants and unlike in the west a lot of food is shared. There are so many holes in it at this point.

I mean at this point should we even worry? It is far more likly now that a huge part of those 50k are vaccinated and those vaccinated tend to spread the desease less and tend to not become as sick. At some point we have to end this we can no longer eradicate it so we should just let it take its natural cause.

Vaccines aren’t as effective on elderly. Korea has a high elderly population. It also has high population density. Most elderly live with their children and even grandchildren.
Indeed. I’m factoring that into my hope that a jury will see all that nonsense as willful ignorance and convict anyway. Manafort got his trial moved out of DC to a somewhat friendlier area, and had one (maybe two) MAGA-hat-wearing jurors who did not want to convict Trump’s friend and believed Mueller was on a Russia-hoax-witch-hunt. But those prosecutors hammered the documentary evidence all day, every day, and got the conviction despite that prejudice. One of those jurors even asked Trump on national television not to undo their verdict with a pardon. Trump himself on trial is another matter, but I still have hope. ).

Republicans made it a point to elect inexperienced and uneducated legislators with extremist tendencies to "drain the swamp" only to engage in the highest degree of cronyism in our nation's history. They're on a self fulfilling prophecy of destroying the government through their inability to govern and deliberate sabotage of our institutions. The IRS didn't even finish the mandated audits of Trump because they only had one person on the case.

I'm cautiously optimistic that voters, whether in Arizona or elsewhere, will start to reap what Biden has been sowing, or at least have a clear path to doing so, and of course, that Trump's standing in the public eye will only worsen in the next 20 months.

Hattusili's son, Tudhaliya IV, was the last strong Hittite king able to keep the Assyrians out of the Hittite heartland to some degree at least, though he too lost much territory to them, and was heavily defeated by Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria in the Battle of Nihriya. He even temporarily annexed the island of Cyprus, before that too fell to Assyria. The last king, Šuppiluliuma II also managed to win some victories, including a naval battle against Alashiya off the coast of Cyprus.[65] But the Assyrians, under Ashur-resh-ishi I had by this time annexed much Hittite territory in Asia Minor and Syria, driving out and defeating the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I in the process, who also had eyes on Hittite lands. The Sea Peoples had already begun their push down the Mediterranean coastline, starting from the Aegean, and continuing all the way to Canaan, founding the state of Philistia – taking Cilicia and Cyprus away from the Hittites en route and cutting off their coveted trade routes. This left the Hittite homelands vulnerable to attack from all directions, and Hattusa was burnt to the ground sometime around 1180 BC following a combined onslaught from new waves of invaders: the Kaskas, Phrygians and Bryges. The Hittite Kingdom thus vanished from historical records, much of the territory being seized by Assyria.[66] Alongside with these attacks, many internal issues also led to the end of the Hittite kingdom. The end of the kingdom was part of the larger Bronze Age Collapse.[67].
no? Im saying that putler started an unjustified, brutal war against a sovereign nation claiming that the people "need" him and they will greet russian troops with open arms.
Yes that's what we are all mentioning. Russians are lying and the figure of 600 they gave is similar to what Ukraine probably took out a few days ago. So they mention a similar number for their base back home to show they are doing something and that they got revenge.
The thing about projection though is that the idea provides a tool for understanding people's psyche, and an important part is that it is an unconscious impulse. The way I understand it, it can either be expressed as a defense mechanism defending one's own deep-down known faults, projecting the same motivations on others — "yes I do this, sure, but look, everybody does" — or maybe it's just because they think that way and so just assume everybody does: when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail.

The difference between these two ideas is pretty subtle and I may not have explained it well enough, but either way I'd argue this isn't what Russia is doing. There's nothing unconscious about it. It's a very conscious fabrication meant to change the subject away from criticism for having done something stupid..

Then again, maybe this does still fit the definition of projection, I don't know. You may be right. All I can say for sure is it's not an unconscious defense mechanism driving a neurosis but rather an intentional act meant to create a known false belief.

I can somewhat sympathize for the poor son-of-a-bitch who's so full of anger about being abused that he sees nothing in the world around him but hatred, in turn justifying his own anger. That hypothetical person may live in an awful hell, but is trapped.

Why does the word chamber get used just because there's torture involved? Can it not just be a room? It feels reductive and trivialising to start throwing around terms like chamber in some weird reflex to using the word torture. Like it makes it feel unconsidered. "Torture chamber" is just a term that you mind reaches for and uses and can gloss over. Torture room, a phrase more in line with how people actually speak, gets more at the truth of the matter, and doesnt derails things by conjuring images of medieval castles and shit.

Sadly not the first time I've heard account's like this from this conflict. Lots of undirected frustration at military incompetence alongside a complete lack of accountability means this stuff will happen even if it isn't policy. (Which it probably is).

At first I was giving him the benefit of the doubt considering it took 3 years to nail Nixon for Watergate. Despite the overwhelming evidence of Trump and Congress of that time, you'd want to be 1000% sure before you drop the gavel that there was in fact a crime committed, especially for a sitting president.

I called it not long after 1/6 saying the fix was in for Trump and those in Congress participated in the coup; they should all have been charged immediately and weren't. When I worked as an investigator and we had a serious case with urgency behind it we worked it nearly 24/7... But with Garland weeks turned into months, and months into years. I suspect Smith is only there to clean up the mess and loose ends - it's nearly too late to indict Trump anyway, as we're approaching the 2024 election rapidly, and soon that case will time out because of it's political implications... But then again WTF do I know - maybe Garland will figure out where his balls dropped off and decide to put them back on for a day or two.

But then the 1/6 committe ended and nothing came of it through midterms. And then, Biden was immediately investigated for classified documents being found. Where is the investigation for Pence, whom was also found to have documents laying around. Our boy Trump got caught red handed with a couple hundred classified documents some of which no president even has the authorization or knowledge to look at.

I noticed it the last few summers. Until a few years ago, whenever i would leave the window open each night there would be dozens of insects coming in. Now it is maybe 1 every other day.
If you think halting climate change is tough for humanity to accomplish, well, saving our insects will even be harder. As the problem is far more complex, with no single cause identified yet. And, reducing CO2 is relatively easy, but how the heck are we meant to reduce electromagnetic fields if tomorrow some smart scientific proved they're responsible for insects' population collapse?

IMHO, the collapse of the insects' population has little to nothing to do with climate change. The latter is caused by greenhouse gases, while the former seems to be caused by something, or many things, that is/are toxic to insects. Theoretically, we can get climate change under control, but still lose our insects. As lowering our emissions, recapturing and thus reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere significantly can halt climate change or even reverse it. But will very probably not save the insects.
IMHO, the collapse of the insects' population has little to nothing to do with climate change. The latter is caused by greenhouse gases, while the former seems to be caused by something, or many things, that is/are toxic to insects. Theoretically, we can get climate change under control, but still lose our insects. As lowering our emissions, recapturing and thus reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere significantly can halt climate change or even reverse it. But will very probably not save the insects.
Last I heard, insects are very sensitive/vulnerable to loss of wild nature (i.e. everything's becoming more and more like sterilized gardens, even forests), light pollution, electromagnetic fields, pesticides and other pollutants.
Everyone complaining even though Bill Gates's humanitarian work has saved more than 50 million people. These are some of the world's poorest suffering form diseases the developed world had eradicated almost a century ago. You guys can complain all you want about how "mean" Microsoft was as a company in the 90s, if there is a utilitarian heaven, Bill is going there.
He's thrown a lot of weight behind a lot of great alternative energy research necessary for the future and the development of least industrialized countries. Hoping he decides to jump in on hybrids of kelp next, as it's a food/energy source and sequesters carbon/acidifcation.

Care to provide some specific examples? I'll argue in Microsoft's favor for the sake of humoring it. Given that security & user learning curves were huge issues in early operating systems, I'd argue that it was appropriate to treat a user friendly backbone OS like a utility company vs. viewing it as a nefarious anti-competitive practice. A secure, user-friendly, and developer friendly is an absolutely massive untaking with the benefits from such a tech leap being absolutely massive. So finishing it ASAP should have been priority and the normal rules of capitalism don't really allow for decisions that just 'make sense'.

Even if I argue with 20/20 hindsight that it probably could have been done as quick/effectively via contracted collaboration, you have the debate of collusion because certain contractors would be left out PLUS the bigger issue of security.

In addition, at the end of the day, Microsoft was still developer friendly enough to allow the development of virtual machine framework for integration of code from other operating systems. So I'd argue they were not trying to cut out third-party developers and, in fact, made their OS so third-party friendly that competitors in the industry were able to secure specialization in many other markets. They get knocked for things like forcing internet explorer to be installed, but whether it's an excuse or not - from my understanding they had not properly compartmentalized some of the network functions of IE (the OS required IE to work).
Russia just announced they are expanding to 1.5 million troops. US commits another $2.5 billion including armored vehicles. A shitload of additional support announced from other Ukraine allies today.
Probably not, but Russia can’t keep this up forever. Their financial and Human Resources are being expended. Ukraine is obviously suffering but as long as NATO countries continue to provide aid, Ukraine can keep it up however long is needed.

Quickest way this ends is with Putin being removed or Russia collapsing. Which might happen. But also might not and if not, it’ll be a grind until Russia is pushed out.

The more innocents that the Russians kill, the less likely Ukraine is going to be to want to negotiate. You don't negotiate with people who murdered your family and drove you away from your home. Early on in the conflict, maybe, but the longer this drags on, the more Ukraine's resolve is just going to strenhen.

The Nazis learned this about the Russians themselves in WWII… not that either side wanted to negotiate, but the atrocities definitely hardened the Soviets.

These are DOJ subpoenas, not Congressional ones. Technically, neither can be ignored, but as we've seen, the Congressional ones don't seem to have much recourse when someone does ignore them.

Thats only from the house, they have to ask the doj to enforce them of invoke enherent contempt; which hasn't been used in almost 100 years.
I have seen comment after comment in multiple threads and even CNN that can't help but compare these deaths to the US and take jabs at the Americans.
I do not think the families of these victims care what the US gun deaths are. I do not think the people who lost their mothers, fathers, daughters, sons care that the US has more murder than Canada, because their family member will not be at Christmas this year due to a Canadian.

Statistically, mass suicide also works, because nobody is alive to shoot at eachother once the coolaid is gone. There's a difference between things that can work and things that are worth doing.

There are so many guns being smuggled in illegally from the USA. An unfortunate side effect of being on the border with the gun violence capital of the world.

But the majority of measures are dishonest. And people are under the misconception that it’ll simply end gun violence for people that don’t have to worry about it.

Throughout the world, countries with strict guns laws have greatly reduced gun violence. The problem in this case is handguns (which are illegal in Canada) being smuggled into Canada. These and other guns can be purchased at open markets in some states without registering. There is more gun violence in the USA in a day than in a year in Canada so yes, gun laws do work. Will it stop all gun violence. Of course not, but watching children being slaughtered in the USA almost daily is sickening and the only ones winning are the NRA and the gun manufacturers who line the pockets of cowardly politicians.
The terminal at New York Airport had to close, but rather than divert to nearby New Jersey, they went all the way back to New Zealand. Clearly the New Jersey Board of Tourism has some work to do. /s.
I don't get it. You are at the halfway point, 8hrs into the flight why turn back when a diversion to a nearby airport would only cause logistical issues that the airline has plenty of time to coordinate..??

There is no reason it would be stuck. What they are saying of they may have been waiting with the aircraft to continue to NYC. But they could have rebooked the passengers on other airlines and returned to Auckland empty. That would have just cost more.

The article mentioned the plane would be stuck for several days if it diverted. They didn't explain why, but if it's not flying for several days, that's lost revenue. This sounds like a purely monitary decision. One defacto canceled flight is better than several.

I’m worried that the grand jury talking about this ahead of indictments will screw up due process and make it easier for the defendants to get out of it.

For me, being "not surprised" would be Trump escaping any consequences of his actions yet again. I will honestly be surprised if he's indicted, not because he shouldn't be, but because I'm too cynical to hope now.

Yeah… and we know that the first item has already been committed in occupied territories. The only one I haven’t seen explicitly done is imposing measures on births, but idk how you’d even do that unless you have full control over the region.

Exactly this. The best case is Ukraine is able to capture a few higher ranking individuals for some public trials. But this isn’t world war 2. Nobody is going to invade Russia and capture those based in Moscow.

Everyone on Reddit is talking about all these war crimes Russia’s committed. Realistically what’s going to happen? I’m very doubtful they’ll be able to get Putin out of Russia and hold any trials.

For the rest of these Russian soldier’s, officer’s, and politician’s lives, they will be hunted down and punished for their war crimes. When Ukraine wins this war, these people will never be able to leave Russia without the risk of getting arrested and extradited to Ukraine to stand trial for their atrocities. If there is ever a regime change in Russia like we saw in Germany at the end of WWII, they will be at risk at home as well.

I just hope they are able to force Russia to return the children they kidnapped but I realize that’s also highly unlikely.
> Both lawyers note that the company did not initiate the legal action in this case, but only made the time theft claim in response to the woman filing her own claim alleging wrongful dismissal.
This article leaves out very important context, which is that she was originally the one to sue her company for $5000 for wrongful termination which ultimately failed as they had evidence that she was not actually working for some portion of the time she was claiming she had.

If she would've just lived with the fact that she had been lying to her employer about her hours worked and been fired quietly, they never would've pursued her for the measly $1500 as it's likely more costly than that to pursue her. It's not more costly however to just respond to her case with the facts and have the tribunal order her to pay their costs and $1500.

Read the article, she was caught fraudulently billing clients and only had to pay back what she got for "wrongful termination." This isn't "some person was lazy at work and got sued for it.".
If that was true, I think it'll have been her turn by now. I think it's more like Dems have a respect for people who have invested in the party itself. People who have helped others raise money, campaigned for other, people who have paid their dues. That doesn't mean a young person like Obama couldn't come from nowhere, but even he put in some work. That's why people like HRC is so well respected in the party. She shows up for others.

Those aren't mutually exclusive options; you don't have to choose. If your candidate wins, regardless of age, they get to run as the DNC representative. But if you want to know why your favorite candidate was picked in the DNC primary even though you are absolutely certain they are the best ever, this might be why.

The culture of the Trump presidency REQUIRED praising POTUS every time he sat through an abbreviated briefing. The extreme example was Dr Birx. Thus, any time Trump did anything with anyone from outside the US, the entire executive branch had to hail it as historical success.

>"What did such extravagant diplomacy achieve? About one of his visits to the Hermit Kingdom, Pompeo writes that Kim “committed to completely getting rid of his nuclear weapons, saying that they were a massive economic burden and made his nation a pariah in the eyes of the world.” But despite two presidential summits, the commitment was not honored, and it was Kim Jong-un who never gave an inch. All that was accomplished was the elevation of the North Korean dictator from outcast to global statesman. Trump’s claim, following his summit with Kim in Singapore, that “there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea,” was either a delusion or a lie, and if the latter, one of thousands.".

"Six Republican co-authors—delegates Geno Chiarelli, Henry Dillon, Riley Keaton, Jonathan Pinson, Dean Jeffries, and Walter Hall".
Six Republican co-authors—delegates Geno Chiarelli, Henry Dillon, Riley Keaton, Jonathan Pinson, Dean Jeffries, and Walter Hall—introduced House Bill 2919 on Monday, which aims create the Sexually Oriented Businesses Regulation Act, which would outlaw "sexually oriented business,” including adult arcades, adult bookstores, adult video stores, cabarets, adult movie theaters, nude model studios, and “sexual encounter centers.”.

The language of the bill is both borderline graphic and incredibly vague: it defines the body parts that stores are prohibited from showing in books, live performances, and films with meticulous specificity, including “human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state” even if covered. It measures nudity as “the appearance of a human bare buttock, anus, anal cleft or cleavage, pubic area, male genitals, female genitals or vulva” and seminudity as “the appearance of the female breast below a horizontal line across the top of the areola at its highest point. Sex acts are defined as “fondling or erotic touching” and “normal or perverted, actual or simulated, including intercourse, oral copulation or sodomy.”.

DeSantis ran a racist bigoted campaign in 2018 and won by only 0.4%, and he ran a racist bigoted campaign in 2022 and won by 20 points. Seems to me the difference is that Charlie Crist is an absolute dogshit candidate that for some reason Florida Democrats just cannot stop running despite his record of getting wrecking in election after election. Every single time it's the same argument "He's a former Republican, so the Republicans will vote for him!", and every single time it's proven wrong again. What happens is Democrats don't want to vote for a former Republican, and Republicans don't want to vote for a Democrat. I just can't with these self proclaimed political strategy grandmasters.

what's the point then if all you have is rep and rep lite. the democrats already act as if they're ashamed of their positions. the real difference is the GQP has decided to revive the anti-LGBTQ bullshit and the left is letting it happen unchallenged.

the fact that DeSantis won by almost 20 points while running a campaign rich in bigotry and full of promises that he will work to make sure the right people die(trans kids, PoC, the unvaxxed) should be a horrific wake up call. The state is more or less a 50/50 purple state according to polling, the Democratic party might want to try to craft a policy message that actually lands with the the average voters in FL. as crazy as that sounds it just might work.
And there's nearly half a million trained and zealous national guard paramilitary who are Putin fanatics, and an intelligence behemoth in the FSB that could almost certainly introduce Prigozhin to a window if they ever felt the need.

That’s what Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, appears to have done this week in an unusual public appeal for ammunition for his fighters in Ukraine. And in the process, he has cast a harsh light on his open feud with Russia’s military leadership on the eve of the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

And in the process, he has cast a harsh light on his open feud with Russia’s military leadership on the eve of the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Prigozhin posted a picture on Telegram showing the bodies of several dozen slain Wagner fighters, piled unceremoniously in a courtyard. Alongside that shocking photo, he posted the image of a formal request from Wagner for more ammunition, pointing the finger of blame squarely at the Russian Ministry of Defense for squandering one of those lives.

The “boost” to these numbers you reference don’t really mean much though. Those people are still going to vote republican, including a vote for trump if he were to get the nomination.
The title is so misleading. Basically its a little like lego toy that can melt and mostly get in the same shape when solidifying. And it needs help to get it back in rough same shape and it uses magnets to do it.
it's just metal that can be melted & is magnetic. there is zero intelligence or logic components in it and you need external hardware. has nothing to do with a "robot". its just metal moved by a magnet.

No they didn’t. This is complete bullshit. They magnetized gallium and ran a current through it.(Gallium melts at room temperature) Then in another article the “scientists” admitted that the video was faked.

still is disappointing that everytime you see news about soft robotic or metal robots that its clickbait.. you always need huge external hardware that makes it not useable in any real reallife usecase.. this researchers just burn money and time and act like they just invented the new big thing.. but then its just a floppy piece of rubber they inflate with a compressor or a piece of metal they move by magnets. its just.. sigh.. :/.

If there’s anything military related that the GOP loves, it’s contractors. Boeing, General Dynamics, etc.

Commanders are responsible too. We’ll imagine we goto war with Russia and we tons of soldiers fall ill to RSV, Flu and Covid. What’s worse is we get disability pay from the VA. Getting ill will increase the chances of things going wrong for you older. Most in the mil got the shot and don’t mind. It’s loud minority and proudboy like types causing the issue. Again, not an issue before Covid. Seriously, republicans may as well create a new religion called “My Christianity”.
Here’s what the Indian government said about those claimed “deaths” mofos counted even natural deaths as death due to work. Again human die naturally and it’s normal.
Omg. These pictures in my memory… at the international tourism exhibition, these guys were even squatting on toilet seats making a fugly mess.

Breaking news in the next week: World cup fans overthrow Qatari government in search of booze. "The Beer Revolution" as it's been called is expected to end around the time the world cup does, as the revolutionaries are drawn elsewhere due to a lack of footie and beer.

Which one? Giving the ability to poorer people to move in and get paid? We do the same with Mexicans here in the USA, but we make it harder for them to work in the USA tho. You aware we actually still use slave labor in the USA? It’s got different name now, it’s called “prison labor”.
Nowadays, to have any sort of meaningful wealth in Russia you need to be a creature of the state. Half your assets are considered state property. (If not Putin’s himself, although I’m not sure he sees much of a difference.) You act in its interests and it tells you what it expects of you, and dipping a toe into Russian politics is entirely off limits unless you’re directed to.
In age of empires there are a few quick chats you can send since it's a fast paced rts when playing multiplayer you can type just a number into chat and it will play a sound, 1 says yes, 2 says no, 11 will play a cackling laugh. The community uses these in things like twitch chat as well so if something funny happens or is said the chat will spam 11s.

My Theory: The GOP shot their wad with Fox News and now they are paying the price. For the few folks on Reddit that don't know; Fox News was the brainchild of Roger Ailes who was in the Nixon White House during Watergate and felt Nixon could have survived if there was a right wing 'news' outlet that could get their narrative out, and (quote) 'do the viewer's thinking for them'..

It couldn't happen overnight, but Republicans play a great long game. Reagan eliminated the Fairness Doctrine, the craft was honed on talk radio, rag TV shows, etc.... but finally in 1996 he found his biggest benefactor in Rupert Murdoch. They spent the next 27 years spewing hate, disinformation, stupidity, and propaganda. And it worked! It helped get George W. Bush elected; it was a key mouthpiece for the Iraq war, it helped get Bush re-elected, it helped kneecap the Obama administration in 2010, it helped get Trump elected in 2016... life was good.

I want to pause for a second and explain how insanely toxic Fox News is to its viewers. This isn't "right leaning" the way MSNBC leans left. Almost every single detail is propagandized. The graphics, the color scheme, the music... all specifically chosen... when a white Christian conservative is on; the color scheme will literally change to calming whites and blues, with the US flag likely making an appearance. The sound is lower, the speech is slower and softer. When a leftist, Democrat, immigrant, minority, BLM etc. clip is playing the color scheme is red, black, the sound changes. Lastly, and most importantly, some portion of every single day is spent painting Democrats as dangerous lunatics bent on destroying the country. Random Tuesday in 1997 with absolutely nothing to report on? Let's find a 'wacko' college professor who is poisoning America's youth with communism. It has been 9628 days of nonstop rage. If you truly believed what you were watching...why WOULDN'T you hate Democrats and try to stop them no matter what it takes.

Now here's the problem. As passionate as the true believers are... they are no longer the majority. Not to say they can't do immense damage to the country. But 2022 midterm turnout was 111 million people, Fox News lead viewship on election night at 7 million. And remember Fox News is now the 'sane' right-wing option. Obviously millions more conservatives get their news and facts elsewhere... but those facts are even more deranged.

A new generation of GOP voters and, more importantly, an increasing number of elected officials, arrived that were raised on Fox News (and eventually right-wing internet). The viewers went from 'useful idiots' rowing the boat to the captains behind the wheel. The 'traditional Conservatives' that never quite believed this nonsense but were happy to accept the votes (the 'adults' in the room) aged out. The old guard of Dole, Kemp, Ford, Bush Sr., George Will, Cheney, McCain had lost control of the monster, replaced by MTG, Boebert, Gaetz, Rick Scott, Trump.

All of this leads to a problem that used to plague the Democrats... the core GOP message has fallen out of orbit with the rest of the country and is drifting into outer space. Again, they are still plenty dangerous. But the old "go right in the primary, tack to the center in the general" model has been incinerated. A generation raised on almost 30 years of propaganda demand candidates as crazy and furious as they are. And the center (myself included, former GOP) think it's fucking bonkers.

At the same time, behind those Boomers and Gen Xers are a new generation of voter that not only wanted nothing to do with Fox News; but were instead raised with the internet. 'Socialism' does not invoke images of Soviet bread lines in their mind; it invokes images of the 'Nordic model' of paved roads, free education, and universal healthcare (those countries aren't actually socialist, but still...). These youth also grew up with mass shooter drills in school. They saw their Fox News-watching parents get destroyed economically in 2008. Then they watched some of their parents and grandparents die from Covid because Fox News and Twitter told them the vaccine had microchips in it.

And most importantly, they vote. More so than any 'youth' voting bloc before them. Young voters are pissed and engaged. .

As mentioned the GOP is still very capable of harming the country. And any young Latino (in Florida in particular) will tell you that the right's new target for propaganda and misinformation is older Latinos. But if the GOP were a stock I would short it. They decided to hit up the ATM and go all-in, and for a while it was on a roll. But they're crapping out.

And Fox News helped to kill off nearly 600,000 (and counting) GOP voters to a now preventable death.

Terrific post, really helps contextualize where these extremists are coming from. I wonder if at some point FoxNews will have to go even harder right to maintain mindshare.

Great ratings and clicks do not equal votes. Fox News doing an offensive segment on women who don't want to have children; or Matt Gaetz tweeting about fat women might get eyes and rage points... but if you are trying to win elections it's poison. Childless overweight women just might still want low taxes; but when you wrap your party brand in hate you aren't winning any new voters.

My perspective is as an engaged political person. It's hard to break out of my own point of view to think about how normal non politically engaged people think about what they see online. I can totally see how people would start to see the right as batshit and then go vote for the first time in a long time.

Yes, it's the algorithms colliding isn't it? What drives clickbaity engagement is the wrong formula for getting people to back your candidate. And because all the tweets, audioclips, and soundbytes stick around they can't tack to center in the general like they used to.

Super sharp observation there (no sarcasm). I hadn't considered that engagement optimization for page views runs counter to motivating people to actually get off their asses and vote!

I said a long time ago Paul Ryan would come back out of hiding the minute Trump was on his way out of the picture. This mother fucker knew Trump was dirty and what was about to happen, and he stepped aside to keep his name and face out of the news for a few years so he can come back as the great white hope of the republican party.

The headline is oxymoronical, all republicans are Trump republicans. He is the most popular figure, and gets more in fundraising than all other republicans and the RNC combined.
It’s so crazy to me that the Iranian revolution which fought to end a government that didn’t reflect its he interests of its populace through violence and incarceration…has now reduced itself to being exactly like that government.
Khomeini was arrested and exiled; and now the man he appointed to succeed him supports the same practices against others including his niece. There is something to be learned by all including governments by reading chapter 76 of Tao Te Ching, that being open to flexibility and change as a person or organization allows you to live on while being rigid leads you towards eventual death. The government of Iran can survive if it allows for change reflecting and protecting the will of its people; or eventually it and the nation will decline and die….and the efforts of the 1979 revolution will have been in vain.

It’s honestly much worse than the previous government. All of the issues from 1979 still exist: lack of political freedom, lack of artistic freedom, no free press, mandatory hijab… which is basically just the same but opposite of the Shahs idea to ban hijab, political violence and repression. They’re just worse now because this government is more evil than Pahlavi’s.

It’s why I fear another person coming in and making themselves the “figurehead” of the revolution the same way Khomeini did when he was in France.

It’s just silly that a government installed by a citizen revolution…is blind to citizens demonstrating peacefully and then it discredits itself further by a crackdown employing murder and sexual assault as a tool of oppression.

He came in, co-opted the revolution and lied to everyone: to Iranians, to world leaders, everyone - and then utilized the US hostage crisis to really seize control and move more progressive minds out of government. And later into prisons to face execution. It was a hijacked revolution in the end.

Mahsa Amini & the other kids martyred for freedom should be the face of our revolution. They lost their lives for… nothing really… and then there’s no danger of any cult of personality, where someone shady comes in and tells people what they want to hear until they have their opportunity to fuck us all again.

Iran straight giving reasons everyday to get overthrown. It's like the Ayatollah and his crew forgot how they came into power. Gun powder can't kill everybody.

And that's where they REALLY messed up. The Chinese disappear people, but make em be nice when they call home. It is ALL THE WAY MESSED UP what they've done to the Uyghurs, but as far as oppression goes, they're the best at using it to keep people quiet.
The 2nd amendment existed so the people could form their own militias using the latest tech without interference. We are a constitutional republic not a democracy, the bill of rights is us telling the government what it can’t do. Not the other way around. The issue today is people decided to become batshit crazy in the past 50 years and start killing innocent people for no reason. The firearms available today are not the reason for this. When you go into a place with unarmed people and have free rain for at least 7 minutes even a single shot rifle can cause mass causalities. Guns like Ar15s and Shotguns are only better than single shot rifles when facing armed people where the goal is to overwhelm. With unarmed people you don’t need to overwhelm them because they can’t easily resist an attack.
The NRA is not a rights organization. They are an industry group. They exist only to sell more guns. Well, and traffic Russian intelligence assets too apparently. I guess everyone has a side gig these days.

Trump thinking he did it all to protect himself, but in the end, even the people he made have abandoned him. Imagine sitting there thinking that all the presidency has done was bring his own crimes to light.

Health care has gotten so much worse after insurance companies adjusted to the affordable care act changes. That act was never supposed to be a one shot and done bill. It is an active game of cat and mouse with insurance companies to keep them from fucking people.

Bernie gets to set the agenda and issue subpoenas. This is his shot to go after criminal acts within the health insurance and hospital industries. He can air out lots of dirty laundry for the american people to see and refer things to the DOJ. He obviously cannot pass bills in the general session as long as republicans can block all legislation, but now he can do the maximum amount possible without a new bill. He can uncover things that help dems win in the next election because people want them addressed.
Fun fact, extremism is what happens when u destabilize a region and fund terrorist organization to further destabilize the region. Cant complain about iraq getting extreme when it was our actions that fucked up the region that it go to this point.

FYI US intervention in the area started in the 1920s when US wanted oil agreements found near Saudi Arabia and started to meddle in Middle Eastern affairs. They set up a military base and everything and began to fuck things up from there.

70 years of US intervention in the area makes it really difficult to fix ur problems when the US is constantly gassing the flames. What the western nations did to the middle east was catastrophic.

TL;DW: the current NBC model estimates Republicans will have 222 seats vs 213 for Democrats, but that estimate is plus/minus 7 seats. So, Democrats could wind up with as many as 220. (Control is 218.).

There are a few ways that Democrats could get to 218. It basically comes down to Democrats sweeping all plausible seats in California and Nevada.

Also, five Democratic Congresspeople who were expected to win in New York and New Jersey lost their races (including Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee). If they had simply gotten the job done, Democrats would be estimated to win control as of right now.

They need to do more to squash this messaging and instill a duty to vote in every election in every district regardless of what the polls are saying. That way the expected wins stay wins and the increase in turnout shows that yes this is what the majority of the population wants.

if we get another president that wins via electoral votes but loses the popular vote by 10's of millions of votes then that might just help push things to change.
And no, their effective rate isn’t lower than minimum wage workers. You might be thinking of a true tax rate. The effective rate of the top 0.001% is 25%. The effective rate for a minimum wage worker is basically 0%, if not less.

The individual cuts last from 2018 to 2025, at which point they return to 2017 levels. And that’s for all people, even billionaires.

Most corporate cuts are temporary. A couple are permanent, but are offset with permanent corporate tax increases. Past 2027, there isn’t a net tax cut anymore.
The problem is that in too many places single family housing is the only type that can be built, there are zoning laws preventing the building of high capacity housing, there are NIMBYs who complain about the skyline and bemoan the demolition of historic parking lots, there are ordinances all over saying what can be built where and for what purposes, and the result is that the demand for housing is significantly outstripping the supply.
It made sense at the time, owning your own home was seen as a source of equity and providing economic security, after all if the shit ever hit the fan at least you could sell or mortgage your house and not be broke.

it was fine until speculative, concentrated capital stepped in. Same with middle class wages. Same with pensions. Same with manufacturing. Same with grocery store pricing.

Our love of single family homes is part of what's driving up housing prices. If one county only allows one home per acre of land, and another allows twenty homes per acre of land, all else being equal which one is going to be more expensive? The one with the restricted supply.

Because when the Russians hacked the RNC they handed incriminating materials to Trump or someone in his circle. And he has been using those materials to make sure he: 1) maintains his wealth, 2) achieves his political aspirations, and 3) is never held accountable for any major crime. And for the most part it has worked.

100% my first thought… but we should by no means ignore it. If we let these things pass just because he continually gets away with it, or because we are just accustomed to it, it will become normalized. We need to keep demanding prosecution.

I just wish campaign finance laws were actually enforced in a meaningful way. But the very people who would be subject to it are in charge of deciding what’s in the law and allocates resources for enforcement. The results are entirely predictable….
Turns out that the back of the Iron Curtain was a one way mirror that never went down, and Putin has been watching himself in it ever since the Soviet Union fell.
Trump would’ve been a disaster. He was siding with Putin from way back, was anti NATO and had every appearance of literally being Putin’s stooge. He defended and praised him a year ago and again just recently stating he trusts Russian president Vladimir Putin more than the "lowlifes" who work in U.S. intelligence. He was a sellout to the USA and to Democracy itself.

Biden has done a solid job of handling this crisis, imo even from a nonpartisan standpoint. I think had they been elected that McCain or even Romney would have faired well also. Obama would have stood up for Ukraine also. Most previous POTUS from either party would’ve been similar.

Ok, so while i am vehemently against donald trump's presidency, almost as a whole, i do think there is more than meets the eye with regards to Trump/Putin relations. I don't think it was as cut and dry "trump is a putin puppet" as most folks as far left as my views tend to seem to think.

I dont believe there was direct collusion trump was aware of, but i do believe putin meddled without trump being totally knowledgable about it. Im sure he had inklings, but their relationship seems less to me like a direct collaboration, it seems like trump definitely did a bit to pacify him for a time without capitulting too much of ACTUAL consequence, aside from embarassing himself at press conferences.

Trump was kissing his ass, for sure, but he didnt pull a chamberlain and allow annexation of land, etc etc. He just simped like an E-boy on live television. Whether you view that as being on the same level is your call.
Part of a renewed effort to strenhen British-Japanese relations. Another big part being the Japanese and British defence industries merging their respective sixth-gen fighter projects into a single platform. That will provide a huge boost to its viability and affordability.
No problem. I believe it is meant to play into the 2021 British Integrated Defence Review’s plan for an “Indo-Pacific tilt” due to the region’s growing importance to the world both geopolitically and economically.

Another aspect of this is the permanent basing of two Royal Navy patrol vessels in the Pacific. They have conducted myriad visits and exercises to invigorate British influence and soft power.

Always found it quite amusing how both the Mongol invasion of Japan and the Spanish Armada's invasion of England where ultimately defeated by storms in the end.

The defence review is currently being redrafted in the wake of the Ukraine invasion but I think it would be extremely foolish to pull back from “East of Suez” once again and have all that effort be for nothing. Either way, post-Brexit, there is a strong impetus to forge stronger alliances with nations in the region. This has come in the form of Japanese and Australian Free Trade Agreements, AUKUS and the Tempest project but also the UK’s application to join the CPTPP Pacific trading bloc. Interesting times ahead for sure.

It’s the same game as the Roe shit, “we just want the states to decide”, then once overturned they start talking about national bans and wanting to thwart ballot initiatives by actual voters who decide to protect abortion. All that shit ever is is a very cheap attempt to pretend their goal to create an authoritarian right wing government is more limited than it actually is.

I work in hazardous spill clean up. I am the foreman and have to make sure my guys dont poison the fuck out of themself. We have a few smokers. Now I knew that benzene was in cigs butt how much I dont know.
Benzene is very bad if its too much. Cancer loving product. We have the rule not more than 0,2 ppm benzene in the air is the safe line. Better know for every million air particles. Only 0,2 of them are allowed to be benzene.

Durinf the break they went on a smoke and I was curious so I got our detector and held it above the cig. 4.4 in 3 seconds. If they inhaled a smoke and exhaled also a nice number.

As a smoker, what I care most about is the effect on my mood and my effect on other people. I've accepted long-term health concerns. I'd rather have thirty years as a chill guy than seventy as a stressed out arsehole.

These are all excellent points, but I do want to add that while we were lucky the Roe reversal was timed so poorly for the GOP, it is inevitable due to their party’s nature that they will continue to take advantage of their position and pull further attacks upon the rights of the citizens all for their own Christian nationalist extremism. There just is no curbing extremism, and once it gets power, like they do in the SCOTUS, they’ll just keep pushing.

I have a lot of misgivings about voting for a guy who would be 83 when inaugurated. It feels like some entitlement bullshit. Is there no one else in the Dem party who can run besides this old man? Seriously.
curious, if they weren't so corrupt how much of it they could have maintained. Either way the Artillery is still going a year later and a bit worried if they manage to start ramping production.
I used to be a technician for the army decades ago. My company's main task was to maintain about 250 armored vehicles built in the 1960s.

Each vehicle was sealed in large oxygen-less bags to preserve them. Every vehicle had to be unsealed every 2 years to be tested and inspected. Any broken parts will be repaired or replaced before the vehicle is sealed up again.

This was a full time job for a company's worth of mechanics and technicians. And my unit had been doing this for at least 30 years. Most vehicles that come out of the bag just need minor fixes before they are ready for use in the field. So I'd say if they were well maintained, there shouldn't be any major issues having 90-95% of the vehicles operational in a short amount of time.

In an ideal world, yes things likely won't break. Most of the time its usually just minor things like rubber seals and hoses, plastic coatings naturally breaking down over time. Things just need lubrication before they start working.

What parts would break during oxygen free storage? Seems odd that if they get stuffed into a garage in an oxygen free bag, anything that wasn’t broke when going in could be broke on the out.

A vehicle might have been accidentally left in the rain and water pooled in an area we couldn't see. Since water is part hydrogen and part oxygen, that meant corrosion can still happen in the two year period.

However, this is the real world. All sorts of weird and statistically low or even outright impossible things can happen.

Sometimes, the sealing bags failed. Seams get broken. Driving the multi-tonne vehicle a little too roughly over the bag might have caused a tear. A bit of metal sticking out from vehicle might poke a small hole in the bag (Seen it happen once or twice with an antenna stub or a weapon mount). Wild animals, even rats, can somehow bite through the thick bag material.

We have a machine hooked up to the bag that routinely pump stuff into the bag to maintain the atmosphere inside. If the hole is small enough to not cause a significant pressure drop, no alerts are triggered but oxygen could still leak in and wreck random havoc. Once, we were alerted of a bag with low pressure failure and we found a dog had somehow made a meter-wide gash in the bag. She had given birth to puppies under the vehicle.

Then there are freak accidents. One vehicle was destroyed and two adjacent vehicles had significant damage when a bolt of lightning punched through the roof of the warehouse to strike the vehicle. I guess the chemicals used to maintain the oxygen-less atmosphere also somehow caused the accumulation of static electricity? Who knows. All I know is that was the first time I saw the vehicle's inch and a half thick top armor plating bent open and torn off the vehicle along the weld lines.

There was one year, when almost every vehicle we opened had the same fault - the protective coating around a flexible cord all became rigid and fell apart on contact, exposing the wires inside. That turned out to be an unexpected manufacturer defect that required finding a replacement material. This was beyond my paygrade, so I don't know the exact details but I heard it was a several year project trying to find a replacement that a company was willing to commit to manufacturing small quantities of for many decades.

When I first moved to Florida (a while back) they had this “impact fee” for out of state cars. It was like $300+ per car to register. It was, in every sense, a tax on people (northerners) moving to Florida. It was deemed unconstitutional a few years later and we got refunds (which was nice).

There's generally an office for unclaimed funds in most states. Might be worth doing a search for you on there. Got a long-unclaimed safety deposit back like 5 years after the fact once.
But i would bet more that it is a test to see how the individual NATO counties react to it, while making it look like an accident.
If war with Russia is inevitable anyways, then better get it over with. For many in the US, this might be far away, but for us in Europe, this is happening right in our neighborhood.

And it's not just Putin, there are many people in Russia who support this war, especially the elite - so just removing Putin alone would not change much.

That cannot be tolerated in my opinion. The least aggressive pathway would be installing air defense against all kinds of missiles all over the eastern border of NATO (and honestly, I'm baffled as to why this isn't already done).

So many people frothing at the mouth for Article 5 to be enacted and for NATO to go to war with Russia. I don’t think they understand “WW3” is the end of life on earth as we know it. As soon as nuclear weapons start flying, it’s pretty much the end for all of us.

Tucker Carlson's only ideal of America is a cult of self-proclaimed superiority in which a designated in-group, that he considers himself a part of, is in charge. He evidently does not see conventional American politics, whether lib or con, as advancing this ideal in the slightest. But he looks at someone like Putin as a person who advances that goal for his nation actively. Which is why he is a Putin sympathiser but cannot root for his own president regardless of faction.

He got tired of being fired from every 24 hour news channel for being an exceedingly bland neocon whose entire personality consisted of a bow tie, and knew FOX was his last chance. So, he gives his audience what he thinks they want, and he makes great money doing so, but he's still an exceedingly bland neocon.

Indeed, I would say that he's an exceedingly bland neocon. The Tucker Carlson you see on FOX today is a character being played so that the real Tucker doesn't have to sit on the sidelines scamming money from neolibs at the Lincoln Project with all of the other exceedingly bland neocons.

He couldn’t stop if he wanted to, and won’t stop because he’s rewarded and validated for being a hate preacher every day.

For one, Reagan was really hawkish when it came to Russia. For two, Tucker is portraying on TV what he thinks the MAGA base want to hear, not what he actually thinks.

As hosts? Not really. Bill O'Reilly was for sure. Megyn Kelly was. However, Glenn Beck was immensely entertaining. He was a lunatic, eventually certifiably so, but he wasn't bland. Hannity isn't really a neocon. He's a nationalist. Ingraham is too. Greta Van Susteren doesn't really believe in anything and never has. Many of their former cadre of analysts and contributors like George Will or Bill Krystal were very much exceedingly bland neocons, eventhough I admit I actually had a bit of a soft spot for Will.

Tucker Carlson is a fascist, which is why he talks like a fascist and sympathises with fascists. This is not a difficult guy to figure out. A neocon and a neolib have at least in common that they love spending money on American defense to advance American geopolitical interests.
So the biggest thing I would say is that misogyny is the clearest indicator of a potential shooter and that needs to be talked about more. Misogyny is one of the biggest recruiting tools the far right uses to suck in angry, young, entitled, cishet white men. Racism, antisemitism, and queer phobia are also huge, but the misogyny often comes first. The far right actively targets imcels and others who hate women and basically throw gasoline on the fires in these hateful men’s brains.

There was this video game I played where every time I destroyed an enemy base, this propaganda radio would come on air and announce that it was a planned demolition, or that it was done to preserve the area's natural environment or something. Don't exactly remember what game though, Just Cause 3 maybe?
.... 30.2F isn't summer weather for a large part of the globe. Like seriously you can just Google the Temps in the arctic and realize that it's warmer than freezing during the summer, Antarctica is colder but it still averages above freezing.

worth noting as well, you're going to get an increase in accidents when you have an increase in activity. For example, you don't usually slip and fall when you're calmly going about your business. You slip and fall when you're rushing or are short on sleep. Same goes for equipment failure. If the equipment is just sitting unused, it's not going to break or cause an accident. Once you start mobilizing it, that's when it breaks. You can't drop a crate of explosives if they never move from storage. Only when you start moving/using them can you have an accident with them.

I can't find any article saying they stopped paying, hence me asking. I know the RNC said they "can't" and "won't" pay Trump's legal bills if he announced, which he has since done. However, I've seen no confirmation that they actually stopped paying them. I'd be interested in knowing whether they did stop, and seeing what kind of revenge Trump puts them through in response.

Meanwhile in America - "With respect to incarceration, at least 137,000 women and men are serving time behind bars on any given day for drug possession....Of the 116 people in Texas serving life sentences for drug possession, seven were convicted of possessing between one and four grams.".
Sure, then give her the 7 days jail and $300 fine for possession of drugs. That's the penalty for the crime she committed.

Literally the statute she was convicted under. It was trafficking for export. Articles 228.1 and 229.1. 2. Trafficking has a meaning. You are trying to profit of it. The specific clause is "1. Illegal making, sale or sending of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or analogues.

Why are you being dishonest? She was convicted (and plead guilty to) drug smuggling and possession charges. Nothing in her conviction said anything about exporting drugs for profit.

And that's all one of our two parties want to run on today. Feelings and spectacle. They want to feel anger, because if someone says the Not Us team are trafficking children in furniture boxes, well, they're not us and therefore evil, so it feels right, doesn't it? When a president gets on a podium and mocks a political opponent like a second grader, the shocked and angered reaction by Not Us is the same spectacle as watching one big dude barrel through two other big dudes, not drop a ball, and keep running.

The article doesn't make sense, because the author is just feeling and not thinking, and now sort of confused that he doesn't know what to think about his feelings. Because he's out of practice.
So does this mean that denying or minimizing the Holodomor will now be a crime in Germany? My understanding is Germany has criminalized genocide denial.
I don't know if you know this, but the USSR's Capital was Moscow and heavily practiced Russian Imperialism... Good luck trying to understand the world.

The Nazis actively killed millions of people in literal death camps. It is unambiguously genocide. They also meticulously recorded their crimes, so there’s no ambiguity over what happened.

But there are a lot of situations where what happened is somewhat disputed, and if it constitutes genocide is disputed. But one legal ruling and suddenly a legitimate historical interpretation of events, possibly even the correct interpretation, is illegal. You could end up in a position where it’s illegal to be correct.

Genocide is a crime which requires intent. It’s very rare to have an unambiguous genocide unless the perpetrator admits it.

“We were faced with the question: what about the women and children?–I have decided on a solution to this problem. I did not consider myself justified to exterminate the men only—in other words, to kill them or have them killed while allowing the avengers, in the form of their children, to grow up in the midst of our sons and grandsons. The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth.”.

So no, you couldn’t argue that. They intended to kill them. They weren’t merely okay with letting them die, they actively exterminated them. You could maybe make the argument for other groups that were victims of the holocaust? But then the question isn’t “did the Nazis commit genocide” but “against exactly which groups did the Nazis commit genocide”.

To be blunt, the European Parliament are not historians. You don’t determine if something is genocide by having the European Parliament vote on it. You might as well ask them to vote on if P=NP.

Not to mention, just imagine if this law goes into effect in Germany, and then another genocide vote reaches the European Parliament. A German member of parliament considers the evidence, and votes no. He is outvoted, and it is classed as genocide. After the vote he is asked why he voted no. He can’t say he voted no because he doesn’t think it met the criteria, that’s now illegal for him to say.

Maybe you mean by academics? Well if you could find a genocide where all academics unanimously agree that would be nice. Of course, if you don’t, and proceed with the law, you will make it illegal for academics to agree with their own work, or to defend why they wrote it.

Let’s say new evidence comes out which, unambiguously, clears it of being genocide. It was actually just incompetence or whatever. It’s illegal to admit you believe the new evidence. It’s illegal to ask for the law to be changed to reflect the new evidence, unless you do so in such a way as to make it clear you don’t actually believe this new evidence, you just want German law to reflect the evidence you don’t believe….

The Nazis went out of there way to tick all of the boxes, it’s like they looked at the definition of genocide as a list of requirements, and then made sure to record their intentions just in case you tried to argue the deaths were merely incidental.

Personally, I don’t agree with it being illegal to deny it, simply because I don’t believe opinions should be illegal, but denying the holocaust was genocide (not quite the same thing as holocaust denial) is not an opinion anyone is going to hold in good faith after any research.

Yes it is. Of course, if you enacted a policy that killed millions of people, you will have almost certainly committed a long list of other crimes for which you will die in prison. A large number of murders, if, say, you wanted them to die but not because of their membership of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. I’m not sure what the international equivalent of gross negligence resulting in death is, but that would be a distinct possibility.

Killing people because you just don’t care if they have enough food to survive isn’t genocide. For it to be genocide you have to deliberately reduce their number.

The best case you would have would be the transferred children. But Russia has a demographic crisis. They might be taking children and re-educating them to create more Russians, not reduce the number of Ukrainians, which wouldn’t count.

I would love to sit here and point out the nearly infinite number of holes in your joke of an argument, but it would be wasted on you. I will say that the reasons people turned on Chavez were completely legitimate and at no time has Lula EVER come close to the absurd shenanigans that Chavez pulled. I will also say that had Chavez gone around raiding and locking up the greedy degenerate short-sighted assholes burning down the rainforest I would STILL support his decision to do that.

Also, that law professor either doesn't know the federal system or Times' editors incorrectly quoted him. The federal system requires a minimum of 85% incarceration. Prisoners may be transferred to a community home for the completion of their sentence or may be transferred to home confinement for completion of their sentences. However, that transfer would only cut into few months of Holme's incarceration in a BOP facility. Not years like the law professor opines.

Either way, the defendant would be sentenced for a non violent violation with a sentence of less than ten years - thus, the BOP would normally place the prisoner into a prison camp.
The Nazis took only two months to complete the occupation of Norway. However, this was from April to June. I wonder how long it would have taken in the winter instead?
Here's the interesting part; Norway at the time had declared themselves neutral after WW1, and had built down their armed forces to a very very reduced neutrality guard. And those 2 months? Thats longer....A LOT longer than any country had resisted the German invasions at the time. It took longer to occupy Norway than it did to occupy Poland and France. Both fairly large military forces at the time. There's also a discepancy in loss numbers. The Germans notoriously underreported losses. My own grandmother comes from a small rural township, where the history books reports from the German's own loss reports; 7 casualties. In reality the Norwegians made a local stand there and was fighting house to house, forcing the Germans to burn them out. And the locals observed the germans taking casualties in the high 2-digits, then throwing their own casualties into remaining houses and lighting them up. Her brother was commandeered by the Germans to drive his truck with casualties to the fires. He made at least 4 runs with the back of his truck stacked to the roof with dead soldiers.

It's worth noting in the interest of full information that France and Britain both sent expeditionary forces into Norway to help defend against the Nazi invasion. That's not to detract from the bravery and fighting the Norwegians did.
The US isn’t some outlier in electing right wing loons into office. Brazil just finished with Jair Bolsonaro, aka Brazil’s Trump and to beat him, they needed to nominate a previous president who spent time in prison for corruption. The Philippines recently voted the Marcos family back into power even though they ran a military dictatorship and stole tax money to support a very lavish lifestyle a generation ago. And the previous guy was someone who ran on creating death squads to kill drug dealers and users without trial- and he did create the death squads and it was a popular policy. And then take a look at the new government Italy just elected.

The MIGOP decided that the Trump-endorsed person who lost by 9 points statewide wasn't crazy enough, so they went with the person who lost by 14 points statewide and is a literal psychopath. Brilliant.

I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, the fair redistricting laws have been a godsend for this state. I hope all the other states get something similar soon.

Michigan's governorship tends to swap back and forth between R and D whenever the incumbent runs into term limits and can't run any more. That will most likely happen again, unless the R stays on their batshit insane course.

Yep, the Michigan GOP coasted by thanks entirely to gerrymandering thanks to luckily being in power during restricting the past 3 times before the independent redistricting commission. Now that they actually have to run competitive races, coupled with their lurch even further to the right, finally broke their disastrous reign in this state.
Imagine Trump suddenly without a stage or social media. Imagine if he could no longer broadcast all of his stupidity to the world. He would already be in jail, and nobody would ever know the lies he is trying to conjure up to seed his followers with anger. His goal is simple:keep the message clear, and somewhat consistent, to seed hate and garner support from his gullible, hateful base. Without that continuous feed of Trumpformation into their brains, they might find themselves listening to common sense, and snapping out of it. The world needs to mute Trump.

So, Putin couldn't do it with his career/professional forces in Feb of 2022 (they lost a lot of them since then), with a bunch of heavy weaponry (that they lost since then), with a lot more ammo and rockets than he has now, with an element of surprise (Ukriane is definitely prepared now, at the very least mentally and motivationally), and before all the heavy weaponry aid received by Ukraine.
Hmmm... and now some drafted plumbers and electricians with a few months of training and rusty machine guns are supposed to take over an entire country. Something doesn't add up...

This is not the same plan. Then their plan was distance, so they sped past defenses and left themselves thin and flanked. Now the target is the defense troops themselves. They might fail, they might underestimate Ukraine, but it’s not the same plan. And it could still bleed the fuck out of Ukraine. Putin can afford to hemorrhage. Ukraine cannot. I feel for their troops.

Not saying this is great news for Ukraine, and it will cost more lives, absolutely. It's just moronic at this point, Putin already lost, no matter what he does. Yes, he will succeed in getting more people on both sides killed, that's about it.
I am sick of the stupid "spy balloon" story. It shows me how easily the entire narrative in the US can be directed towards unimportant events. We aren't rioting over being expected to survive an economy where 90 percent of the revenue is taken off the top by a small minority of ridiculously wealthy people, we aren't demanding a total reformation of our police despite rampant abuse of power and corruption, we aren't taking any steps to prevent daily mass shootings, we aren't even mad that an entire political party is openly embracing fascism. We are yelling at a fucking balloon. The system is functioning as intended.

Russia already sabotaged Nord Stream 1 once before the explosion took place, blaming technical difficulties.
Gazprom started reducing the flow of gas to Europe after sanctions were implemented for the Russia-Ukraine war. They shutdown their pipeline to Poland in April. Then they reduced NordStream 1 flow to 40% capacity in June. They said it wasn't their fault, citing a faulty part from German company Siemens. Then they reduced it to 20%. By August it wasn't delivering any gas at all, while they claimed they needed a turbine sourced in Canada that presumably couldn't be released due to sanctions. No one actually believed that the technical problems warranted shutting the pipeline completely down. Yet Gazprom offered to start running Nord Stream 2 under a new contract instead (which would only be able to deliver at about 50% capacity). Germany balked at the offer and procured the turbine needed for repairs. Russia refused to have it delivered.

The important point here imo is the "new contract" part, since they want to force payment in rubles to prop up the exchange rate.

It is out of the question that it was in Russia's interest to sabotage NS1. The question remains, did they do it?

Rubles versus dollars is a factor. I think the lenh of assured sales/revenue is a factor, plus the rate of course. Pipeline contracts are made in at least 5-year increments. For a previously unused pipeline, a contract for 30 years wouldn't be unusual.

Putin says NS2 can start at 50% capacity: There's a TASS article from August 3, I'm not going to link to it but there's some commentary.

The Smartmatic tag at the bottom of the piece brings up a list of related events Law & Crime have covered and shows they filed suit on Feb 4th, 2021. They're good at linking to court documents which should help to see the stages if no-one has set it out elsewhere.

This is the first time that I’m hearing Trump’s lawyers were OAN host?!? I was always knew he was scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel but hiring a OAN TV host is so much worse than I ever thought. Trump is so fucked.

before working for Trump. , that's the kind of people who are willing to gamble that the "fame" of working for Trump is worth more than being paid. Then they find out they need to hire a lawyer of their own once the SHTF like in Ms. Bobb's case here.

A lot of countries are sympathetic to Russia either because of investment, opposition former colonial powers now in NATO, or just strongman dictators who want to be like Putin. Right now, they are watching from the sidelines with no eagerness to back a failing Russian campaign. If they think there's suddenly something to be gained by siding with Russia or just that they see Russia as their only ally who is about to get annihilated until suddenly another big power joins them and foresee the same thing happening to themselves, they will be coming out of the woodwork to support Russia. For example, let's say Russia gets targeted somewhere deep inside Russian territory that hits a little too close to home for Putin and they find a way to convince Iran or China or someone else along those lines that this was definitely NATO striking them.
If you're fighting a defensive war against an invading neighbor then strikes across the border on military targets are a completely legitimate defensive tactic.

Have to wonder how many "reshuffles" does it take for the Russians start to wonder whether the "special operation" is doomed and the blame is somewhere higher..
Military analysts think getting practically the highest possible ranked person to take over is a major escalation in the war; they theorise a reorganisation of the various fronts under a unified command structure and new offensives being planned.

Considering that the highest rank in Russian army has never served in army, yes i’m talking about Shoigu, and how russia failed this bs invasion. I think Gerasimov’s outcome will be as bad as shoigu. Too old, too corrupted, too drunk(yeah you can find YouTube clips when Gerasimov is drunk in front of soldiers 🤣).

And yeah, calling “random nobodies” the “ones before him” is kinda wild. Surovikin and Dvornikov. Surovikin were also partially commander in Syrian war, and he was commanded of space/aero forces before appointment at this shitshow invasion. They both were comms in the Syrian war.

Actually you’re probably right, even the Russian mil bloggers have doubts over Gerasimov and preferred Surovikin.

Political appointment because he’s a close friend of Putin and he’s not ethnically Slavic so low possibility of him replacing Putin (supposedly, so goes the rumours).

I am aware of him; the thing is they keep on changing leadership on various levels as if that would magically fix the underlying issues. In reality frequent changes will likely just add to the confusion so seems like just a deflection of blame from Putin to anyone else.

It’s the 3rd or 4th time they changing commanders I recall? This makes no sense to me tbh. I feel that Asian people want Putin to win for some reason, but another change of commander won’t fix the root reasons behind Russian fail.

Just another way for Putin to shift blame in the media. With Gerasimov in overall command Putin can now say "It was his idea to begin with and even he can't make it work.".

I mean, I’m not so well versed in modern Catholic or Radical Protestant (common rabble) interpretations, but I know it’s tied up in one of those irreconcilable doctrinal disputes between the different churches of the Anglican Communion.

Now I’m a High Church Episcopalian type. I came down on Archbishop Laud’s side of the Golden Fence. And although this is America and we’re a Republic and bow to no King these days (other than the one in Heaven, of course), I take my Processions with Incense and bend at the HIGH ALTER for communion from one common chalice, NOT with the rabble at the low alter like some Low Church types or, God forbid, from little separate glasses in pews like some Puritanical Savages.
I just dont get this perspective. We should be setting the example for the rest of society. I was happy to see other medical workers who refused the shot get canned, they made the rest of us look bad. How can ordinary citizens trust that it is safe if medical workers who should know best are refusing. that is to say nothing of the oath that many of us took to do no harm. If you are infected and spreading the infection you sure as shit are doing harm. This is also why for as long as I have been in the field have had to get a flu shot or not be able to go to work. Nobody threw a shitfit over that, and it was going on for decades. Hell I had to prove my vaccination status for all childhood diseases several times during training, and for good reason. Nobody wants to get measles from an asshole antivax doctor or nurse in addition to whatever you are there for. This is basic infection control, just like washing hands or contact precautions for c.diff. We should be held to a higher standard.
EDIT: sorry for “regione”, I meant region. It’s the iPhone autocorrect (Italian keyboard). Love you all who corrected me. Eat more pasta and spaghetti and everything with a vocal at the end, please ❤️.

It was close to Milan but in another province of the same regione. But Italy was only the first one to become aware of it. Covid popped up everywhere after the very first test on non-Chinese people in Italy.
I voted Republican my entire life. I even voted for Trump the first time. I had never voted for a democrat president until this recent election. Thanks to Trump and the GOP that allowed his treachery I can swear on my life I will never ever vote Republican again in my life. I lost two good friends one in Iraq shot by a sniper and another blown to bits in Afghanistan. The Capitol and the entire Washinon DC is a symbol of that sacrifice. Trump lead an insurrection on sacred ground and it took him hours to finally go on TV and call off his supporters. I try to tell my MAGA family if they support trump or the GOP they support the desecration of Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice. Jan 6th brought tears to my eyes especially considering these were my neighbors who had no problem shitting all over my friends sacrifices.

I happily would, but it’s a bit presumptuous isn’t it? I donate money to small local charities but I am not sure I can really walk up to her an offer her £50 for a supermarket shop. Maybe she’s too proud to go to the food bank where she could get more food, I don’t know. It’s not my job to insert myself into other people’s lives. But I also know that we pay good money so that every kid is fed well at nursery - including this little girl who clearly isn’t getting enough food at home, but is at nursery and looks very healthy. Unfortunately there are plenty of kids who don’t have a great nursery to fall back on and don’t get the nutrition they need.
Now I understand how the Irish famine wasn’t really a genocide, because the British elite would do the same to their countrymen. It’s not about ethicity or culture, it’s all about money and how much you got.

It depends on if he wants to roll with the current monetization strategy. I wouldn't be surprised to see his pay-for-verification scheme spearhead an economical strategy shift for Twitter. It's honestly hard for me to guess since his moral and ethical compasses are so far out of whack and he's more than willing to wrack up a bunch of collateral damage.

Unfathomable cruelty is her whole thing, the novelty has really worn off though. After going after school shooting survivors you can't really go much lower. Short of her pushing kids out of wheelchairs there isn't really anything she can do to out so the awful things she has done in the past.

She will also probably give a speech about how it's wheels that a threat to the country and not guns, because lots of guns are brought in using truck and railroad wheels.

Hot take....Musk wants to kill TS and knows it will happen if/when Trump doesn't have the self control to not tweet. To him, unblocking Trump from Twitter isn't an ethical issue, but primarily a business decision. He wants TS users to migrate to Twitter but doesn't care about the political, ethical, or moral fallout from forcing Trump into this position.

Honestly though who knows? Billionaires exist in a different enough reality they may as well be aliens.
Let's be honest. She doesn't need the money. She has money and comes from a family who's quite comfortable financially. If I can try to read her mind for a moment, what she's saying out loud is that she's been working so hard to save America from any of her made up threats to our democracy that she is not being rewarded for her stewardship. Me thinks that in the recesses of her mind, she's entitled to way more money after she's appeared to be an opponent of actually working as an elected leader to the United States Congress. It's an honor and a privilege to be in that position. Considering that $174k/year is plenty, plus all of the financial allowances and benefits she receives as she's a Congressperson. I'm almost certain she plays dirty with money and buys stocks just like a great many of them on both sides. When Cawthorne makes $41 million as a freshman congressperson, you have to follow the trail. There's money to be made legally, but no big donors are stepping forward to support her because she's toxic. And to think she'll go on the speaking circuit with anyone actually wanting to listen to her blabber off a litany of tropes and slurs as if anyone is yearning for it. She is a whiner and a blowhard. I don't feel sorry for her, I feel sorry for all of America because this is what we have as elected leaders to run the country.

From watching so many of his followers, I've found it isn't necessarily him they love (at least when he first started making waves) it was the fact that he said exactly what they were thinking and that mixed with the fact that he said/behaved exactly like they would've has they been on the stage with Hilary.

The people here, this kind of congregation for example, are bombarded with scary stories from right-wing media constantly. They listen to it on their drive to work (the 1 radio station in the state has a morning show that is very right-wing), they talk about it with their co-workers during the day, they listen to it on their drive home, they watch it on the TV over dinner, and at night they read about it on their phone before they fall asleep.

This isn't possible. Churches, especially in the South where I'm familiar with, are nothing more than mandatory right-wing community meetings with Christian window dressing. One time I attended a church in Pascagoula, MS with a former friend and I kid you not it was like watching a 1hr speech prepared by Fox News opinion writers where they spoke out against immigrants, atheists, and the evil Democrats. I went to several churches with this person (they were in the choir) and it was the same every time.

I'm not sure how you reach out to that. Without aggressive, questionable, measures I don't think there is a way. They are programmed to hate Democrats and liberals no matter what. They don't see Democrats and liberals as "people" even. Just the "enemy". An enemy they are convinced they are at war with.

His base has felt victimized and left behind for years by the university educated liberal movement. When they see someone viciously going after those "enemies" and watching the left have everything they've build go up in flames would've been emotionally akin to having a heroin high for the first time....and they've been chasing that high ever since.
Crazy cause when I paid a tax company to do my taxes one year and they forgot to file a paper the irs came at me with a $500 or $600 charge and when I called the company the irs they said it’s on you not the company. I called that company and had paid for the protections (mind you I worked one job and prob bare minimum return paperwork) they said we’ll come see us. I had since moved an hour and a half away and this was before where were now with everything online. I said fax me the form I’ll sign and fax it back. Cool done deal. Nope they fucked up again. IRS said we’ll still on you buddy. Go back to the company and they finally send the right form. Fuck this system and paying for protections means nothing in my experience. Just send me a damn bill if I owe something and make this system dummy proof to do by yourself. Since then I’ve never used and actual tax service. I will do online free tax USA. Not free but cheap.

Reading the article rather than the crappy headline. The doctors are largely concerned about the GM crop being a roundup resistant variant. i.e. this allows them to unleash spraying roundup on everything to death.
Shit should be illegal. Not only is that shit going to destroy the ecosystem, Bayer is going to use accidental cross-polination to get rid of anyone who doesn't use their shit.

The simple fact that it even does still cross-polinate is a good indicator that it's intentional. What, you don't think they could add a gene where only the pure strain remains viable?

So you are implying that a question can not be answered until you can find a single college graduate that holds a contrarian opinion? As long as you can find a single creationist mathematician, we can not assume Earth is older than 5000 years? As long as you can find an anti-vaxer lawyer, we can not assume vaccines are safe?

You're jumping to step 2 without considering step 1, which is, what does it mean to say that a "majority of Republicans" are "working for Russia." Regardless, I'll play along with your charade.

Did you read the above link? The Republicans that were "spending the 4th of July in Russia" involved a congressional delegation that went to Moscow's US embassy to warn Russia against meddling in US elections. You made it sound like they were vacationing over the holiday break.

At that time, why would anyone have been against this trip? Are you saying that you're against election integrity? Why are you annoyed that Republicans are trying to stop Russia from meddling in our elections? Democrats don't even like the 4th of July, yet when Republicans spend that particular day in a foreign nation, they develop fake outrage. Why?

If that is what you call "evidence" in that standing members of Congress from a major political party are somehow "working" for a foreign nation, then all I can do is laugh.
Highly doubt this comes out to be true. India would officially take the Russian side, and not just Russia, Iran as well, which makes it way worse, and sanctions would absolutely cripple them. As much as Indians want to claim, we really are not as self sufficient, and there’s only so much tiptoeing you can go about before you’re hit by sanctions. So I’m holding my reservations, and I hope this doesn’t happen, but what do ik.
Note also- how i keep saying US corporations. Because in the end, every single legislation in the US is backed by corporate lobbying- who look for shareholder interests .

Everything can be exempted from sanctions. Thats just the way the US works. They lay out blanket sanctions and then selectively give exemptions based on their own national interests- which here overlaps with India’s national interest.

US corporations are looking to shift manufacturing away from China and into India/Vietnam etc. Guess where will India get the raw materials to support those giant manufacturing complexes?

US corporations will also benefit from a general rising of middle class in India. They are already locked out of the Chinese market. Who will they sell their shit to ? Where will their next billion dollar growth come from ? Which means that the Indian economy , as a whole, has to be helped to grow and grow. So that it can keep consuming Western products.

I mean I can definitely see that happen, but I can't see India jumping off the rope they've been walking on. They're tiptoeing as it is, I highly doubt they'll make it this obvious. Plus, after what's happened with Russia, India wouldn't wanna risk it so soon. India still hasn't gotten a share out of China's pie in manufacturing, they're making strides. It would just mess the situation up far more imo.

Try getting your Congress to act on it then. Let us know how it goes . They just narrowly elected a House Speaker. Sth tells me that your 118th House wont be passing any significant legislations anytime soon.

Exactly, we're making strides, but we aren't even competing with China at the level many want to claim. A lot of IT and software industry work is still not product oriented, atleast not as much as service. So yeah I highly doubt India would agree to this, it seems they aren't going behind cheap oil atm.

I am just giving an example- i am noy a diplomat- but the idea that sanctions apply to everyone the same way is unfounded since US ( and the West) are known to put exemptions for every sanction they dole out.

I dont agree with most of the stuff the U.S. Supreme Court has been doing lately but If state laws violate the U.S. constitution, and police officers and sheriffs declare an oath to the constitution...Guess who is going to win in the courts? This does not erode the legitimacy of the courts.

The state wanted this to end up in the courts otherwise they would not have pushed gun control they knew would be overturned on constitutional grounds. They are wasting tax payer dollars to make a political statement.

That’s because you republican dummies have been wildly misinformed about how our constitution and federalism works. There is a difference between a local municipality defying state law and States or local municipalities choosing not to utilize state funds and resources to enforce federal laws.
And that still harms Russia. Before sanctions, people exported goods to Russia at a modest profit, which was called "business", instead of profiteering. Now they pay a premium. It would be better if Turkey got with the fucking program so that China could screw them a little harder, but they're still paying a premium, while their energy revenue is cut.
Turkey is having economic problems, and war profiteering is probably the main thing keeping them afloat- selling Bayraktars to Ukraine and microchips to Russia is good business. But we need to acknowledge that Turkey was the first to share complicated weapons systems, and the Bayraktars were critical in the chaotic first days of the invasion. They played a big role in sinking the Moskva.

It hurts them and we need to keep it up, but we also need to be more sober on Russia's own capabilities. I've argued about all this before, and people are always so eager to jump to "We've done it We've defeated Russia No way they get around this Our victory is at hand" but in reality, Russia isn't going to take any of this sitting down, they will search for ways around everything we do, to trick us into believing the opposite of what is happening, and we need to think ahead, instead of coping for a quick win.
For the people who didn't read the article. He's telling Russians in Russia that the Russian government is going to close the border in a week for a 2nd wave of mobilisation. He's effectively telling them to leave Russia before they get sent to the front lines.
This farce of a war with a nuclear “superpower” and its much smaller neighbor needs to end asap. Mad Vlad and his Generals have no idea how to fix this quagmire meanwhile real people are dying. Putin trying to pull Belarus into the war while Belarus seems to be avoiding any direct intervention again. Their army will do nothing more than make this a two front war again which didn’t work well the first time. Belarus’s army is weak and under equipped as well and that puppet of a leader knows he’s walking a tightrope.

Mad Vlad must if these numbers aren’t enough for him to pack up and head home. He’s depleted his land army of its stockpiles and an estimated 100k Russians have died in a failed invasion. If that shit happened anywhere else the government would have been overthrown. It’s a good thing the Russian population are sheep because they’re going to the slaughter.

If only there were some resource that might answer the very question you have. Huh. Maybe someone will post an article with the details related to this headline.
Winter has come to the steppes. The earth is frozen hard as bone, and the only movement is steam rising from the nostrils of men and horses. Only the promise of battle brings warmth.
It’s the same here in most of New England, I’m in VT and it’s far warmer than it should be. The average low temp for the next 10 days is still over 20°F/-7°C and a lot of the daily highs are above freezing. Now that might sound cold to people in warm climates by it is a naturally warm for this time of year, January is supposed to be the coldest month. This years average low and high temperatures for December and January have been 10°F or more higher than they should be. It’s concerning because while it’s cutting count on our heating bills nature evolves to a climate over a period of millions of years and the flora and fauna are confused and damaged by unpredictable weather. My fruit trees didn’t drop their leaves for at least a month past when they did the last few years and it got so warm in late November into December that some of them started trying to regrow leaves which is definitely not good for them.

There is some equally ridiculous shit the GOP is pushing for and the way that gets thwarted is engaging everyone who doesn't already side with them to see them for the threat they pose to our values and freedoms.

They aren't the ones that need convincing or needing to hear their "heroes" are in fact terrorists. It's people who fail to see the Alt-Right and GOP as existential threats to democracy and the rule of law, that need to keeping hearing that a terrorist is a terrorist.

Ashli Babbitt died committing an act of domestic terrorism. She attempted to leap over a barricade to attack sitting members of Congress and embolden others to follow her over the barricade. What's worse is she served in the Air Force and turned her back her oath. She was mortally wounded by a federal agent in response to her actions in order to protect law makers from terrorists.
Vietnamese here, his family was in extreme poverty and he weighed supposedly only 22kg at 10 years old. He was collecting scrap metal to pay for his martial arts class when he fell down inside a 25cm concrete pillar.
I suspect the boy died very early on because its a 35 meter fall and it would only took about a few minute to suffocate.

not really sure from what op and below article says but my 2 cents on the fact that when you breathe out, chest decompress, might slip further down -> even harder to breathe in because not enough space for chest expansion -> suffocation. Maybe even panic can speed it up.

I don’t know if it’s better or worse it took so long to get to him before he died. A lot of the inflammatory events could have been adverted had the area been cleared of gawkers and idiots could work together instead of trying to proclaim they were going to be the genius to free him. I just feel so awful for his brother and friend desperately trying to get him out while rescue workers played strategist from a safe distance. The absolute disrespect his body was treated with afterwards is appalling as well.
It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, drink some lukewarm cocoa, argue about the best Christmas movie (the memes this week have informed me that Die Hard was originally a pagan movie so it can't be that one), and talk about whatever your heart desires.

The sunflowers I didn't even plant are now 5'6" tall and are sporting yellow flowers, despite a straight week of freezing mornings. I have wrapped a Build-Yer-Own Skateboard kit for one of my nephews, and have also included wrist guards in case his dad raises an eyebrow. Soon I will get some applewood chips rolling in the smoker so I can start prepping an elk roast and some duck wings/legs/hearts for tomorrow's supper.

So many folk on the horizon... my wife and I each have five siblings, and they have 10 children between them, one of which has three of her own. I think I've spent more on gifts than on rent this month, and I hope to retain my Best Uncle Ever title for the 22nd straight year.

I shoot one elk a year up in Oregon. I hunt duck for 100 days in the winter, I take one hog, I take two or three turkeys, I fish as many salmon and halibut as I can in their seasons. Sometimes I buy chicken just for a change of pace, but it's genuinely been about four years since I had to support what I consider to be a largely inhumane and unclean meat industry.
I really can't see the UK sustaining this type of social crisis for very long until it reaches to a very critical point.
This critical point could be people starting to die in droves because they simply can't afford to live. It could be that this situation causes permenant severe mental and physical health issues for a very significant portion of the population, which cuts down the national life expectancy, results in overall loss of productivity and a permanent dependency on welfare (I'd argue we're already here with this one). It could even be people responding to policy decisions with violence and an overall hostile and aggressive attitude is developed towards politics and politicians.

More inaction? More posturing? More false promises? More borrowing? At what point does a conservative politician wake up and realise that they actually have to start doing something more productive than giving pretty speeches to the camera? If never, then why the fuck are they in power and how stupid do you have to be to vote for this kind of person?

This is pedantic in the extreme. Do you deny that a rational person with a reasonable amount of knowledge of Britain's current economic condition would correctly understand the statement "heat or eat"? If so, then the shorthand works.

Yes, how an article is framed and what tone is used can absolutely direct public opinion. But this ain't it chief.
While I know Russia typically has lower income in December, that's still startlingly close to "Russia is going to run out of money in 3-4 months".
And their energy revenues are still dropping as more sanctions kick in, so that may accelerate even further.

It's even more interesting since Putin can't just devalue the ruble to settle the budget like before. Hydrocarbon exports are down, gas sales have dwindled and the Ural is being sold at 40% the Brent. OTOH imports of sanctioned or self-sanctioned goods are already overpriced. Plus all the hoops to get trade flowing, evading sanctions and whatnot.

Moscow will very soon turn on the printing press, and once it starts it won't be able to shut off again. And then, the ruble will finally turn into rubble again.

Well, during all the 2022 liquidity part of the fund decreased from 10% GDP to 7,8% GDP. And that is still more then in all the years before 2020. At the same rate, it will take like 4-5 years to spend it all. Also, it's spending was an emergency measure related, among other things, to the freezing of Russian assets, mobilisations, etc.

Of course, if the energy market conditions are unfavorable and war continues, this could lead to further deficits of the budget. But the government is already taking measures to compensate that, for example, increases the resource extraction tax.

Overall, the proposal to decrease mandatory liquidity part from 10% to 7%, described by article, is kinda strange. Taking into account that it is already almost at 7%.

For me it looks as if he wants to spend newcoming money to the internal investments instead of buying foreign currency as reserves until it reaches 10% one more time. But if so, he has a very optimistic view about future fund earnings, in my opinion.

No I'm saying because of their budget deficit that the money they took out is to help prop up the ruble and government spending for most of the year.

Things were pretty much normal for Jan/Feb, then prices shot up after the invasion leading to huge energy revenues on the same volumes, then both prices and volumes began to decrease towards the end of the year as sanctions kicked in. So by December they'd blown all of the excess revenue from the entirety of 2022, and were in heavy deficit.

Yes, but if they had to pull that money out in December it means that they'd blown their entire once-off surplus for the year and were in deficit.

So I don't see any reasonable expectation that the drawdown in December was intended to cover the rest of 2023.
I mean, what is he going to do besides confess to another crime and beg grandmas for money? We have had six years of that. He is going to have up the stakes a bit if he wants the clicks. Nothing we have seen before like proclaiming his lust for his daughter or easily disproven lies about how big his crowds are or how strong and healthy he is. I would say go to space, but that has been played out. Maybe he could dig up Ivana like Geraldo with the vault, though that really didn’t play well. He could jump a jet ski over a penned in shark, though. That would be cool. Maybe wear a boss leather jacket while doing it.

It’s insane. I watched the 2 part Frontline doc on this and it’s so insane how Pegasus is an unregulated company. Their shit ass of a lawyer told reporters that they vet countries who buy the software yet when pressed about Hungary and why they were given the software when its KNOWN that Hungary is a sketchy place at best, he had no answer and kept repeating “we don’t talk about our current customers”.

the company is not called pegasus, but NSO Group and it is an Israeli cyber intelligence for profit org manned by ex-mosad members. Credit where credit is due please.

1) Pegasus can be installed on any phone, it doesn't require the user to click on a link. Many countries are using it. It allows complete access to all the information on the phone...location data, texts, photos, calls....and it can turn the phone into a remote listening device, flipping the mic on so that they can listen in on conversations.

That being said, I feel like the opposition is more grounded against content that would pop up in Unit 4 as being explicitly from a Critical Race Theory perspective. Like, page 25 straight up says Topic 4.15 is on texts from Kimberlé Crenshaw and Angela Davis, who are very much connected to CRT. And for the right, that is evidence that “CRT is being taught in K12 schools,” or is at least being pushed.

The governor said the course violates legislation dubbed the Stop WOKE Act he signed last year. It bars instruction that defines people as necessarily oppressed or privileged based on their race. At least some writers the course cites believe modern U.S. society endorses white supremacy while oppressing racial minorities, gay people and women.

Florida is pretty much blatantly embracing racism at this point:dvanced Placement African American Studies course because “we want education, not indoctrination.” It was revealed last week that the Florida Department of Education recently told the College Board it would bar the course unless changes are made.

The state then issued a chart late Friday that says the course promotes the idea that modern American society oppresses Black people, other minorities and women, includes a chapter on “Black Queer Studies” that the administration finds inappropriate, and uses articles by critics of capitalism.

“This course on Black history, what’s one of the lessons about? Queer theory. Now who would say that an important part of Black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda,” said DeSantis, a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024.

Would it be a UAP..? I thought for it to be classified as a UFO, they had to be manned by someone..? I could be wrong. Would have been cooler if it was a UFO, tbh.

That response was planned by a lot of media and Dem conventioneers to pave the way for John Kerry as the '04 Dem nominee, and they wanted as much competition sucked out of the room as possible. (I know that sounds conspiratorial, but I lived through it and when you put it altogether, it's clear as the sky above Everest).

How Howard Dean got treated and ignored (the 50 state strategy anyone?) is emblematic of how progressives have been and will continue to be treated by the establishment.

It's similar to what the media did to Bernie in 2020. Biden was in like 5th place after Iowa, then almost every candidate dropped out on the same day and endorsed him, and CNN and MSNBC ran coverage of the event like it was the Super Bowl.
Every day in this country is torture! We have corrupt idots making decisions, we all disagree with. Yet, we always end up paying for whatever uneducated choices they concoct. It is a communistic government pretending to be a democracy.
As someone that was raised to idolise Mandela, the ANC and the rainbow nation that South Africa was meant to be become after Apartheid, I feel incredibly saddened at what it has become.

Every day I see the massive brain drain of talented White, Black and Asian South Africans here in the UK making a better life for themselves. It truly makes me sad to see what this nation that was so talked up for me in my youth has become.

I wish I could be in the UK honestly there's too much wrong in this country. Someone said it well "Majority rule doesn't work in a mental institution" So I highly doubt the ANC will be out of power anytime soon plus corruption is basically advertised everywhere you go, Its too deep in the roots so cutting a few branches won't help anything. The people are easily manipulative especially the youth (my youth) as long as they get free money and beer than they will basically do anything. I get it every country has its problems but these are worse cause there was and is so much potential in this country but people only care about themselves not about the future of themselves or our country as a whole. And don't get me started on the crime rate and safety.
What I don’t understand is the media coverage. CNN has a gif of her getting off the plane and they’re doing real time updates. No one cares this much.
They are building her up to be some sort of hero....a feel good story for the holidays. They will probably have a press conference with her and Biden and she will dunk on him.

Y0u MusT b A TrUmPer. Yeah, everyone should be pissed. It’s ludicrous. She had better have the best speech ever when she addresses the public. Tears, stories of mistreatment by the Russians, stories about her past that make us feel sorry for her, stories about how much she’s addicted to drugs and going to seek treatment ...well maybe not that since there are so many Democrats voters that only vote that way because they’re addicted to marijuana and think it will get legalized by Dems.

The president literally just traded an arms dealer to get her out of prison. I wouldn't feel too bad for her, if that's not privilege I don't know what is.
Had your chance for 20 years to defend their interests. Real doubtful you will defend their interests now. Should have picked up that gun when you had the chance.
I agree with your take one hundred percent. The shitty thing is the guys have power, cruelty, and many psychological tricks to get what they want. Look at Iran’s women the past few generations.

They won't treat women equally, give afghan women programs to leave the country to get the opportunities they can't get at home. See how the taliban men do without women at all, rather than just having them for breeding/slave purposes.

yeah, maybe thats why women can still go to school and get an education in America, instead of just birthing babies and making sandwiches... Stupid Americans and their ability to flush dictators down the crapper. How dare they say that you should fight for your own right to exist and live! lol.
JERUSALEM, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to remove a senior minister over a past tax fraud conviction, in a setback for the new right-wing coalition government.
The 10-to-one ruling on Shas party leader Aryeh Deri looks likely to further stoke tensions between the Cabinet and Israel's Supreme Court over government reform plans which aim to rein in the top court.

They cannot allow such a ridiculous law--the ability to overrule the High Court with a simple majority--to pass. It would mean that the legislative can ignore any and every law, to the point of even getting rid of democracy altogether. Such a law won't make Israel undemocratic, but it will enable an autocratic takeover, which means it cannot be allowed to pass because it threatens Israel's democracy.

Not if the High Court trash that law, which it should. If it doesn't, then it would mean the government could theoretically delete the courts, legislation, and executive, and install a fascist theocracy with a king (to take an extreme example) with absolutely no legal mechanism to stop them.

Castrating the High Court with no constitution or any other mechanism to rein in a potentially corrupt legislative will mean Israel won't be a democracy anymore--as far as democracy is actually defined, which requires: suffrage, 3 branches of power (judicial, legislative, executive) with separation of powers implemented, a free press, human rights to prevent suppression of voters, and as a KPI of sorts for how well it performs: the transfer of power.

A law that will allow Israel to become undemocratic (and also instantly makes it a flawed democracy, even more flawed than the U.S.) is, by virtue, an undemocratic law, which should be straightforward for the courts to overrule.

Israel is Jewish and Democratic and any law that attempts to contradict the characteristics of the state--as defined in the Basic Laws and the declaration of independence--is is an invalid law. Or so the Supreme Court is supposed to rule.

Not yet. This ruling is incredibly soft and allows Deris party to retain his ministries, and for Deri to remain a member of knesset (even though he's signed a plea deal as a condition of one of his convictions promising that he won't return to public life). As well, the government is planning to pass laws which allow a simple majority in the knesset to overrule the supreme court, effectively nullifying it. So the battle is far from won.

This is not merely a summary. 'Jewish' and 'Democratic' is in the Basic Law defining Liberty in the State of Israel.

The Basic Law even goes to expressly forbid the ability to change the Basic Law, even under a state of emergency, so the executive can't circumvent it and the Knesset can't legislate the word democratic out of it, either.

He's basically the one to be blamed for the Oslo accords - the one that gave Israel 0 benefits, and only launched an Intifada against us, where terror attacked by the Palestinians only grew stronger, buses exploded left and right, daily terror attacks throughout Israel. It only caused misery to the Israelis and didn't help one bit to the peace in the area - especially since the PA shortly after dropped the act and didn't do anything from what was promised.

Nothing from what was promised happened by the PA, hundreds of civilians died, thousands got injured, people couldn't feel safe walking in the street of their house in Tel Aviv without fearing being bombed by a Palestinian. But yay That was sure helpful and didn't only help the PA killing more civilians with the more control they now have.

Safe allowance for Jews to Joseph's tomb? Nope, everytime terrorists shoot the soldiers accompanying the incoming Jews who just want to pray, and throw dozens of molotovs each week (the video from this week you just see literally fire driving around because of so many molotovs). Acknowledging Israel's right to exist? Nope. Stopping terrorists? Happen, but barely and probably more for the own benefit. They have a rule of paying blood money to terrorists who are jailed in Israel for killing a civilian.

The international headline was that Kabul fell in one day without a bullet fired. It's very misleading not to take into account all the events that led to it in the months prior to it. Unless you were closely following the war, you wouldn't know of the lenhy battles fought in the provinces and border crossings.
It is high time (well past time, actually) for the entire world to wash its hands of Afghanistan entirely. All previous efforts at aid and assistance should be re-directed to assisting the escape and re-settlement of all individuals who wish to escape that irredeemable hellhole.

There are some good examples of mass refugee relocation though. Vietnamese were virtually nonexistent in the US until the post-war refugee surge, and they have since settled and integrated quite well. Median household income for Vietnamese Americans is now , which is well above the average, and even above the $66k for White Americans.

This is masterful trolling by Big Gretch to the state republicans who are in a deep deep quandary after the Nov elections here. They even lost all college boards, it was a full blue tsunami in Mi.

Its not a lifetime position in MI, but still good to have a person in their 30's. Bolden was also the 3rd most voted in the recent election in Mi-who elects their state supreme's in a supposed "non partisan" basis. What this does mean though, is that Bolden now gets a full term and then can run two more times after this term- where MI supreme's typically only have two terms.

And she's only 34 years old. Great material to groom for SCOTUS job AYAP. In few years a circuit Court and in another few years, SCOTUS! She could be very well as young as Thomas when appointed, but still be at least 5 times more qualified.

More importantly, in future elections she will be able to run as an incumbent. I have nothing to back this up, but my gut says that the incumbency boost is even more valuable for non-partisan elections.

Traditionally, incumbents perform better in elections than challengers or candidates running for an open seat. So if a candidate runs for a seat they already have, they are generally favored in that election.

I would argue that this effect is stronger for non-partisan races, where party affiliation of a candidate might be unclear (the candidate cannot benefit from straight ticket partisan voters).

Basically, because Bolden is now on the Michigan Supreme Court, she is likely to stay on the Michigan Supreme Court when she runs for re-election.

But I already got an idea of grooming her to become SCOTUS Justice to replace Thomas. Something like an antidote of Thomas and Barrett put together. I hope that she becomes Circuit judge in few years to have the necessary experience. She could be younger than either Barrett or Thomas when nominated and still have more relevant experience than both put together!
They hate immigrants but maintaining the status quo of migrant workers taking the jobs no one else wants is supported by the current immigration system. Make it really hard to get here, make them afraid to speak up, all so they can exploit them. I remember one restaurant owner would "hire" migrants for several weeks to be bus boys and when they asked to be paid he would say he can't until their paperwork went through and he was still waiting for it. He would string people along for weeks or months and never pay, then just do it again to the next one. No one ever filed against him because they were afraid of getting deported.

Religion is a practice in insanity. Mixing it with power is a macabre nightmare. And we live on a planet where people never stop doing it.
Don't come at with us with that "it's not religion" bullshit. Religion has been the reason for millions and millions of horrific murders and countless more oppression to billions.

So yeah, sometimes, we sane people need to look around at each other and fucking empathize with each other about the nightmare that is living in a cult planet. If you don't like that, tough shit. We at least deserve to relate to one another while living through this horrible chapter of history. I can only hope humanity somehow moves past the dark ages where such ridiculous nonsense causes such heinous trouble.

Tax fraud in TX for sure, they are pretty clear about what "principle residence" means when you file the paperwork for a homestead exemption (it's a pretty standard thing there, but was new to us when we moved there and bought a house several years ago).

Arguably, you are not an inhabitant of a state at the time of your election if you claim principal residence in a different state at that time.

The text in the Constitution is vague enough that it requires judicial interpretation/caselaw to reach a conclusion. I’m not sure what the caselaw looks like, but that’s not the same thing as saying that he is definitively federally eligible to run for Senate.

The idea that this is the GOP's idea of a qualified Black man makes me sick. If I was a Black Republican I'd be pissed, but then again Black republicans ready live in an alternate universe so they may actually be proud of this moron.During 2020 election they were so proud that they elected one Lt. Give. They had be reminded that Dems had already elected several Black governor's and we just elected a Blasian VP.

Not that hard. We know when the election ends. Even with a runoff the election still ends in a year he is claiming tax benefits for primary residence in Texas.

If questioned, he could certainly claim to have moved his primary residence between Georgia and Texas multiple times in both 21 and 22, but we all know that would be at best a legal fiction. And since it would be a fiction, and since he has done a wide variety of things in both states and both years that require legal residency, it would be pretty easy for him to accidentally admit, while making excuses, to primary residency in the wrong state at the wrong time, or for an insufficient number of consecutive days for his actions to all be legal.

I wish someone would encourage these folks to google some trans men, like Chaz Bono, and ask themselves why they are desperate for him to be sharing a bathroom with their daughters.

It seems like many bathrooms in France are like that at least at larger venues. I have been in bathrooms where the toilets were in individual stalls and the sinks for hand washing were shared. Men and women could use the sinks together.

If safety at school was such a genuine concern they would be trying to protect the kids from being shot, not from their transgender friends and classmates.
Why should it feel bad? If Republicans reshaped their policies to shit I liked or were any good at all then I'd vote for them. But they don't, can't, and won't. They don't even try. It's mask off. And until trans rights rights secured federally I will never vote for them. The dems seriously try my fucking patience every election promising better rights and protections for lgbt people and never delivering a single fucking time at the federallevel. Do you have any idea how easy my vote would be to steal if a party promised and delivered that? I hate both of them just the dems less because at least they pretend to care when they lie to my face.

I got the impression Melania was pretty pissed off about his 2016 run in the first place. She signed on to be a rich guy's trophy wife, not to occupy the national spotlight as First Lady with all of the extra attention and responsibilities involved in that role.

Literally the only thing I remember reading in the news about Tiffany is that she apparently was banging a member of her secret service detail lmao. She definitely seems like the most normal of that family.

That is not the sentiment in Texas. A lot of republicans died during the pandemic and they worked hard on gerrymandering to offset it. It worked, Texas and Florida are redder than they’ve ever been.
However, there is an ongoing tendency. 60-80% of russian ‘citizens’ are politically passive - they indeed do not care much of the war or anything else outside of their bubble, including such dystopian policies. They go about their usual life even in the midst of all this barbarianism. The rest fall into two categories - the opposition and the hardline patriots, each of these groups is neither homogenous nor large enough to cause any real political turmoil for the kremlin. The thing is, this sort of system was maintained by a social contract of sorts. I wont go into all the details, but the deal between the regime and the people is now starting to fall apart due to many reasons. This causes a very slow process through which the politically inactive majority starts drifting into either the opposition or turbopatriot minority groups. The resulting political stress might cause major shifts in the balance of power in russia in the near future. One can only hope that the masses do not become further fascisized, although that is a real possibility.
Advanced weaponry superseded survival of the fittest in war a long time ago. Should be obvious at least after a team of dudes usually sitting in an office built the first nukes.
Whatever came afterwards, at least the Revolution got the Russian people out of the meatgrinder of an unwinnable war, that their despotic leader had forced them into.
The longer they wait before they can take action, the less people they will have to do it with because they'll be stuffed into the conscript meatgrinder.

In the end, it's always the same energy as fascists, people who are willing to band together and sacrifice others for the hope of personally benefiting.

Reddit Revolutionaries love romanticizing communist propaganda but simply refuse to accept that the propaganda was just bullshit, the revolutions resulted in a lot of people being murdered by the state or starved and a couple of generations later its just capitalism in a more authoritarian state.

The same people who cheekily share communist propaganda can't name a point in history where communism actually delivered on its promises. Then have the stones to say "We'll we've never really tried it, maybe it'll work when we do it!".
The proposal was never meant for Ukraine. It is internal propaganda and merely the first step at that. The whole plot will go down something like this.
This is not an honest offer. This is just another lie designed to escalate now and give apologists in later decades an argument of Putin being the victim instead of the villain here. Something Putin's successors will draw upon, because there sure as hell is not going to be any change in Russia in the decades to come. Russia will be North Korea 2.0 soon.

Putin declares the armistice on a religious holiday. No matter what happens Putin will claim the Ukrainians broke it on the holiest of days. This attack will be named as the reason to close the borders, declare a mobilization and bring more companies under direct control for the purposes of a war economy.

You don't get to invade your neighbour and then demand a ceasefire when you are losing. That is crazy, even for Putin. I think he knew it would be refused and he just wanted something to show domestic audiences that Ukraine is the bad guy.

No, FIFA and everyone supporting the WC sold themselves to Qatar, but that doesn't put Qatar on the moral high ground. They're still despicable human rights violators, and I expect a relatively unpopular WC is going to help teach FIFA not to make similar mistakes going forward.

Exactly, they’ve never stop being bigots, they simply rebranded their bigotry. Just as they did during and after the civil rights movement. I tell people all the time, don’t forget the bigots hitting and spitting on black people trying to sit at white lunch counters are still here and their ideology hasn’t changed.
I work with adults who have had (sometimes multiple) traumatic brain injuries from car crashes or being hit by a car as a pedestrian. My specific job is teaching wood shop and art-related vocational skills, while my wife teaches warehouse work in a different building. The job is equally stressful and emotionally exhausting. Having to deal with a 200 pound adult with the temperament of a toddler can even be dangerous. The job pays less than the starting pay at McDonald's and the company treats the staff like prisoners along with the clients.
Yeah, I hang out in the /ems and /nursing subreddits. They’re worked like dogs paid like shit and there’s an incredibly rigid hierarchy where everyone looks down on the next level.

Some are more or less just a little goofy or forgetful, but have anger management issues. It all really depends on what part of the brain was injured and how severely. So it's a wild hit and miss of ability and disability. Our job is to figure out what these folks can do, what they can be trained to do, and get them out into the workforce in some capacity if we can. For most of them that's never going to happen. But they're paid pretty fairly for the work they do, whether it's one day a week or five.

The funny thing is, the vast majority of them are extremely positive, optimistic, and grateful to be alive. There are varying degrees of cognitive disability among the group -- some are frozen in time at the age they had their accident, some regressed to childhood, and some are essentially unchanged -- but it's also coupled with various degrees of physical disability. One guy is essentially a terminator. He's made almost entirely of titanium and carbon fiber, has one eye, and a tendency to get super emotional about his life. But he also walks, very slowly and unsteadily, with a walker. Others are in wheelchairs. One of my clients lost his senses of sight and smell and is otherwise basically unchanged.
They run up debt transferring public funds to cronies’ private pockets. Then when Democrats try to do some paltry thing for the public good, the GQP cries “Deficit National debt” Furthering the USA down the road to a dysfunctional democracy whose frustrated and increasingly ignorant citizens will eagerly vote for an authoritarian leader: ie, fascism. Fascism is always a grift by the economic elite, feigning populist outrage against the cultural elite and “intellectuals” (anyone with the critical thinking skills to point out the grift). Fascism happens when the elite who shit the bed will inevitably be called on it so they need a bait and switch. See also, the Tea Party.

I read one WP article on this and think it's true the midterms kinda proved it. No matter how good the economy is the current GOP base will only vote for a white xtian theocracy. Gas prices and inflation are just fodder for them and makes no difference if they're transitory. There's no way they're gonna support any bipartisan let alone Democratic plan to take any sort of action to solve any economic or social issue at this point. They simply don't care. It boils down to demographics younger people aren't excited to live in a country that resembles Iran or Afghanistan.

Humans are pretty good at using cooperation in the service of competition; that's what teamwork is for, on sports fields and in markets. Using competition in the service of cooperation is also very useful; some ways of creating a public good are more effective than others, and honest data can lead to even better refinements. But we've let our playing fields come to prioritize competition and profits over cooperation and values.

The logic by the lower Court indicates that the police can be sued in the future since there is now (because of a different case, I assume) clear SCOTUS guidance that this is protected speech.

So the police have the right to arrest you if you criticize them and you can't do anything about it so long as they claim you're disrupting their operations. That's fucked up.

Edit: My reading of the article is off here. The facts in this case are a bit complicated, and no other case has been heard about this. It is a bad decision, but doesn't give carte blanche to arrest any parody maker. But it comes way too close to doing so.

I actually just heard it today. Qualified immunity means no suing the cops unless there is established law which specifically means a nearly exact case to the situation at hand that violated the constitution had to have been ruled on. So for new cases like social media that haven’t had a constitutional case heard and ruled on in court you can never sue a cop.

IANAL but I would think the first amendment allows you to criticize and satirize the police, even if it makes their jobs more difficult. But if the criteria is that a similar case has to have been heard before, and the supreme court declines to hear any similar cases, then it sounds like we no longer have the right to satirize the cops without fear of arrest.

Yea the lady on the radio said even if they violate your constitutional rights. The guest gave an example where they kneed a guy so hard he lost his spleen and he couldn’t get them for medical costs. It’s why people don’t like qualified immunity but the lady also said the Supreme Court has been strenhening qualified immunity over the years so it’s ever more settled law.

In China, the state plays a significant role in controlling the economy. The government sets economic policies and goals, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a major role in key industries such as energy, transportation, and heavy manufacturing. The government also regulates prices and foreign investment, and controls the flow of capital in and out of the country.

The state also has a strong influence on the allocation of resources, and often prioritizes investment in strategic industries deemed important for national development. Additionally, the government sets targets for economic growth, and local officials are often evaluated based on their ability to meet these targets.

In recent years, China has implemented market-oriented economic reforms, such as liberalizing prices and reducing state intervention in certain sectors, but the state sector still plays a major role in the economy, and the state still maintains control over key industries and resources.

Russian oil already costs more to produce than their competitors so they are already making less money at market prices. The fact they have to sell at a steep markdown hurts them. But they are so desperate for Western cash, they will sell for a much lower profit.

Not every person gets a say in how things are done in China. Far from it in fact. It’s basically an oligarchy with better planning for the future.

Every barrel that is "sneaked" in that way, costs a lot to hide. That's money the middle men make, but they can't compete at world market oil prices, unless they pay Russia a lot less than world market prices.

Net result: world oil markets are stable, prices reasonable; yet Russia isn't making nearly as much as they did a year ago for a barrel of oil.

This isn't as bad as it seems. The goal is to lower Russian profits while also keeping oil markets running.

If they make no money their oil simply isn't reaching world markets. That makes Western oil prices shoot up. People pay more at the pump. People will put up with a lot of crap, but paying a lot for gas makes people angry.

Angry people can be manipulated into thinking the fastest way to cheap gas is to remove sanctions, perhaps even find a way to end the war faster by "keeping our weapons here, to protect us".

There was already a lot of that talk a few months ago when gas prices reached their peak, but it cooled off as gas prices went back down.

The goal is to keep the Western public happy enough to allow arming Ukraine and sanctions in place, while denying Russia "most" of the money they would have made.

tl;dr cutting Russia off 100% will make oil prices shoot up. People angry about gas prices will drop support for sanctions and Ukraine.
Unless she works in the plaza with the Target or at the one across the street with the Chase bank I doubt it. No access at all is permitted from about Cantrill to L -- not even bicycles. Maybe the robotics place still has power, and some of the little offices along the east run of 2nd might be online, but it's a mess down there. Dog park is now a dog pond.
Trees down all over. Half the power poles along 2nd are down, if not straight snapped in half. Four massive trees down right behind my own house. The debris is considerable, but the city's been doing a great job sawing it up and pushing it out of the way.

I am about as pro-gun control as they get but, as an Oregonian, I reluctantly voted against this for the simple reason that I don't want the Police controlling the system. They are part of the problem!

> State Rep. Anna Eskamani released a statement to Orlando Weekly late Friday afternoon, condemning the state's actions in no uncertain terms. "Governor Ron DeSantis’ culture wars are destroying people’s jobs and livelihoods. The very notion of shutting down a small business over a drag show is insane and extreme," said Eskamani. "In the United States we do not allow the government to determine what we can read, see or hear or who we can gather with. Targeting drag performances limits everyone’s freedom of speech and is all a part of the Governor’s sick anti-LGBTQ+ agenda.".

And anybody who does identify as a leftist and didn't vote for Democrats probably will be willing to write pages and pages about why, and none of it will include the Democratic party being radical. Those type of people are more than likely to accuse the Democratic party of being tools for the capitalist class.

"Look what you progressives made her do! She was forced to hold up build back better until that private equity tax hike got stripped out and no corporate taxes were increased.".
Ofc he isn't. He isn't Europe's last dictator for nothing. Well... Hungary but yeah... but if you go back 20y ago, Luka was playing both sides MUCH more. He was very wishy washy between the EU and Russia. Its just, he's running out of bargaining chips and he's chosen his side for good now - not that the EU would have accepted his election results anyway...
Well he’s savvy enough to remain in power this long. It’s easy to dismiss these autocrats as being pantomime bad guys who needn’t be taken seriously, like Gaddafi for example, but if you look at how well they were able to read a room politically in order to get power it’s impressive. Like, at the end of the day, _they ARE running nations_. I don’t know about Lukashenko, but he would have had to know who were his rivals and enemies, what they wanted, how he could buy their support, and how to maintain leadership for decades. You’d have to be able to do that and know how to continually monitor the politics of your political rivals and society otherwise you’d never get a decent nights sleep for fear of being assassinated.

The protests in 2020 weren't "shut down" with "support", they were systematically exterminated with dozens if not hundreds of key leaders "disappearing" through russian death-squads. There's a reason one protest-leader was found "suicided" by hanging in a fucking German public park.

Maybe its a language issue but support makes sense here, and does not propose a dichotomy or anything. If I want to kick a puppy and I ask a renowned puppy kicker to help, they supported my puppy kicking.
Imagine the stupidity, lobbing munitions imprecise enough that it locks onto and strikes a neutral flag's vessel.

Turkey does have skin in the game as a Black Sea power, and they've been supplying Ukraine since BEFORE the invasion as passive support. At this point, the only way Russia sees reason is if/when they get kicked back to pre-2014 borders.

And hitting civilian ships, even Turkish-owned ones, serves Russia: it informs that Ukranian ports are not safe. And because Ukraine won't (and can't) do the same with Russian ports, it creates a situation where Russian ports are safer.

Endrogan wants to play both sides and has set himself up as a diplomatic mastermind because he is in the position. Putin does not mind that Turkish ships are hit because he knows that Endrogan will not raise issue with that.

So as far as Putin is concerned, this is winning because wasting military hardwa like this, even though e can barely or not at all able to replace it, is his only hope of scavenging any sort of victory here. He has very little hope of gaining a military victory as long as Ukraine is supported.

> In the early '90s, about 90% of people in the U.S. identified as Christians, the report said. In 2020, Christians accounted for about 64% of the U.S. population, including children. Meanwhile, those who are not affiliated with a religion has grown from 16% in 2007 to 30% in 2020, according to the research. All other religions, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, accounted for about 6% in 2020.

Just like Sarah Huckabee Sanders won the governorship of Arkansas, when she couldn't even handle the white house press corps, but her daddy's money and that magic (R) next to her name got her elected over someone who studied nuclear physics at MIT, and has a PhD in URBAN PLANNING. What could have been better for Arkansas?

Oh, I know. I own a lake house there. Great watersports, nice and quiet, but the local hangouts are the Wal-Mart parking lot, and members only (ie. white members) bars. Of course, that's dramatic. There are a couple people of color in the surrounding area, but not many. Some nearby towns are like being in deliverance.
So, it’s 2023, and you risk your life as an American to raise a point in the Red Square, and this is it? Wow. Nevermind the cows, Russians are torturing children. Doesn’t sound like the most rational individual.

So I can respect some forms of vegan activism even if they can be controversial. However, to parade animals in a protest fashion, knowing the likelihood of you getting arrested is high and with no knowledge of what will happen to the animal post arrest, is completely hypocritical.

It’s broken at every level. The privates and corporals don’t have adequate training, their are no NCOs to lead them and the lowest ranking officers aren’t generally leading the assaults. The mid ranking officers are often 100km behind the lines and don’t really know what is going on on the ground meanwhile competent high ranking officials are considered a risk to Putin so the overall war is being managed by incompetent generals. Meanwhile at every step you have micro management and the pursuit of arbitrary political goals.
This is a classic Russian response to direct public anger towards lower ranking officials, and deflect it from the Tsar/General Secretary/President.

The Russian military structure is a mess but that said they have the shown the ability to put half a million men into the field, 5,000 tanks and pump tens of millions of shells at Ukrainian forces. Even an “incompetent” army of that scale can’t be beaten easily.

The “spoiled” and “decadent” view of the west also helps explain Putin’s logic when invading. He, wrongly, assumed that the west was overly materialistic, greedy and weak. He also believed western commitment to things like democracy, sovereignty and a rules based international order were just lies.

I feel like teachers should all be treating this like a health and safety issue, and taking a stance that this isn't their responsibility or purview: if the state wants to classroom, go ahead, but they shouldn't be risking a felony over failure to remove a book in a building filled with books. Florida schools should be closed until the government's done burning books.
It blows my mind that a book that was required reading for me also in my (non-Florida) high school is now legitimately a felony for a teacher to teach about in Florida. What a weird fucking world we live in.

Now many people dont have land lines, pollsters can use cellphones but then people might not answer a number that they do not recognize (especially younger people), and let it go to voice mail (now this is also the case for landlines). There is an overall trend in avoiding long phone conversations, so some people just hang up after understating that it is a survey or not respond to the follow up surveys at a later date (which is a big issue because pollster ideally want to see how the opinions of the same people are changing). Online surveys avoid some of these issues, but then it becomes very difficult to really know who you are really surveying, for example you could accidently survey a non-citizen or a 15 year old. Landlines, cell phones and online also reach to different demographics, which skew the sample.

Yep, this is a scheme that is the origin of the current 9-justice composition of the court. There were 9 circuits so therefore 9 justices. Of course, the fact that there are now 11 circuits, plus the DC and Federal circuits kinda makes it seem like we need to have more justices. Weird how no one in the government seems to agree with that.

Amusingly, Thomas has the smallest assignment out of all of them. He only has one circuit and it only has three states in it, and I am SURE that its totally coincidental that those states have been at the center of virtually every election related piece of court malfeasance: Alabama, Florida, Georgia.

Adding some additional rules like a 75 vote confirmation requirement and rules like "the Garland rule" which is a time limit on the Senate for voting on a nominee. If the nominee isn't voted on by the full senate within 3 months of being nominated he is automatically approved. Another necessary rule is the 2 strikes rule. If two nominees get shot down by the senate, then a randomly selected judge from the next lower court in the same party as the president is automatically promoted.

We need to expand the judiciary 3 fold across the board. The SCOTUS should have 28 justices, yes twenty eight. There should be 4 courts of 7 and the makeup of each court should be randomly selected from the pool of 28 at the start of each annual term. This will help prevent gaming the court because you never know who will be in which court or which of the four courts your case will end up in.

Wait so these big sprawling highway networks that we plowed under farmland for and build suburban one off housing all over the place using is stupidly expensive to keep maintaining? Well by all means, I’m sure since you pride your citizens on their civic pride they will surely pay tax by a largeish increase to property, and other local taxes. This is the question people, why are we not consolidating resources for important things like healthcare, childcare instead of expanding roads even further.

It’s actually because we collect road taxes through gas sales, so if we go all electric people won’t be paying their part for the roads if they don’t change how that is collected. You can’t tax something else like tires, because people can just go out of state every 50k miles.

That makes sense only if they are evening out the average. Meaning that they have found that the average person pays $300 in tax from filling up their gas tank. Google says the average driver uses about 650 gallons a year. Tn charges 27.4 cents per gallon. So, approximately $178 dollars a year in tax per person earned through a gas tax. They want to up the electric tax to $300. So, unless TN drivers have a much higher average usage, or google is wrong, they're overcharging electric car users by approximately $122 a year.

I broke it down elsewhere, but according to google the average person buys 650 gallons of gas a year. So, at 27.4 cents per gallon they will be paying $178 a year in gas taxes. Tn is increasing the charge for EV drivers to $300, which is $122 more than what the average person driving a gas vehicle is paying.

So, unless TN drivers are well above the average, it seems that they're certain punishing EV drivers with a heavier tax burden. Also, I've seen some indication that the 650 per person is high. If that's the case, then the increase is even less warranted and an even more egregious punishment.
Bit of a rant here about my beloved country. Canada has opened the floodgates for anyone and everyone. 500,000 per year plus 250,000 international students and 125,000 temporary work permit employees in all industries. This is going to be more every year as per Justin Trudeau's policy. Rent for a one bedroom in Canada is averaging $2000. a month, if you can find one. Homelessness in the winter sucks. There will be many deaths this year in this country because there is no place people can afford to live. We have Ukrainians landing in Vancouver whom can't find a place and it has been on national news for awhile. This country will welcome you but don't expect a place to live unless you are renting a room for $1200 per month with a house full of people and one bathroom. There is absolutely a housing crises in this country, not to mention 24 hour waits in your local hospital to be seen and 3 day waits for a bed while you wait in the hallways with hundreds of other citizens.
Technically the Ukrainian refugees who come to Canada could eventually get citizenship. It's a bit of a long process as they start as temporary residents who can have a chance to become permanent residents who can then become citizens.And.

Just donated again last night, every little bit really helps. Their economy is gonna be in the ground for awhile after this so hopefully people keep supporting.

So it would take around 5 years or so of them living in Canada before they could get full citizenship.
They have a 4 trillion economy. For a 1.5 million army, they have 2.6 million in economic activity to support each service member. Numbers are puchasing power parity, what is what you actually get for your money.
I know there's a meme about it being smaller than Italy, but that's at exchange rate conversions. A bit of common sense, world's largest country and has 140 million people and industrialised in the first half of the 20th century should make you really pause when you read that statement.

But we know some countries are cheaper than others. $10 hamburger in new york is different to a $10 hamburger in Yekaterinburg. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) accounts for those differences and say those two hamburgers are materially the same and thus both worth $10 for our PPP purposes.

In PPP adjusted terms, Russia has a per capita GDP (not a national GDP) comparable to Kazakhstan or Venezuela. And that was before the Ukranian war and all its devastation. Probably also before oligarchs siphon off most of the money. I doubt they can even change the bulbs in the streetlights. Putin is probably talking out his ass like all the other times.

I know its hard to go against dictatorship with so many armed force. Its just sad that Russian people who suffers through this has to go through this pain too. I am sure many just want to live in peace.
Russia cheats on a national, countrywide level. The Russian gov't helps the athletes cheat and they still get to play.
100% agree. I'm also boycotting the Olympics. The rest of the world shouldn't be participating in the billionaire's wank party anyways.

Meanwhile Russia is so fundamentally ingrained into the filth of the IOC that they still get to compete EVEN when they're banned for doping. "Well you guys can play, you just can't wear your country colours".

Yeah. I get the point of coming together, you're right to bring it up, but I can't get over how unjust it would be given the ongoing genocide. Ignoring national politics is itself a policy, there's no escaping politics. Maybe try something different than Munich?

Yes, the person made a point. I don't want to dismiss it completely but imagine we never make changes because things were not as good in the past. We'd never make progress. Eventually we improve by saying allowing China was bad, and we're going to ban them in the future if the UN GA or HRC makes a resolution that they ignore, for example. The way UN GA made a resolution that Russia should de-occupy Ukraine, as another practical example I'm aware of.

You're right that it shouldn't fall on the IOC to make judgement calls but they could subscribe to organizations who are well equipped to make judgements like UN GA and HRC...

I am not sure but I can only speculate that Vedder/Pearl Jam and Radiohead used to be more universal than they are in the US,and Taylor Swift is not only universally popular across the political spectrum but also across a very wide range of age demographics (I think Gaga tends to attract an older, different kind of crowd). I’m just imagining all the parents from back in the Slammin Screen Door days and they’ve only multiplied since then; I,agile the outcry of thousands of Swifties at your door as AG lol.
This was reported like the Torah burning was banned by Swedish authorities. That false information was further used to accuse Sweden of bias and hypocrisy.
As the article says, it was dialogue between the man who planned to burn the Torah and other Muslims what made the man change his mind. Authorities didn't stop him and he would've gotten a permission for his demonstration.

Yeah, that was quite irresponsible from Israeli authorities. I understand why they wanted it to be perceived as them having more clout with the Swedish government than Erdogan and also they wanted to get all the praise for preventing that event from taking place, but those statements from Israeli Foreign Ministry and ambassador painted a completely wrong picture of how it went down.

The only way the Swedish government was involved is that the Swedish Prime Minister apparently got into direct contact with the organizer and asked him to rethink his plan, but it ultimately was the organizer's own decision.

Just to add, the translation says "call", not as in phone call, but as in call to action. Most likely referring to a press conference from the day (or so) before were the the P.M asked to be respectful. Jpost also got it wrong.

This would go against the Ministerial rule - the P.M would basically be gone from his post by the time the phone call ended.

No, it’s gotten to a point where this due diligence should have been done long before the election and now trying to get him to face any kind of consequence for his illegal activity will be seen as dems/libs/left trying to rig an election and disenfranchise voters.

Best case scenario, they go after him for the tax savings he received because he can claim he wrongfully considered the Texas home his primary residence and lives in Georgia full time.
So this is how far Russia has come since Khrushchev's attack against Stalinism. They errect statues to long gone tyrant and they theorise reverting the name of the city back to him.
Khrushchev would be rolling in his grave that still people in power laud this mass murdering psychopath. Putinism in a nut shell.

No support for renaming it back to its original of Царицын (Tsaritsyn— Tsar’s station) I guess, for the same “historical” (bullshit) reasons, amirite?

A recent survey conducted by state pollster VTsIOM found that 67% of residents in Volgograd, Russia are against renaming the city to Stalingrad, which was its name from 1925 to 1961 in honor of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. In contrast, 26% of the city's population of nearly 1 million people support the idea of reverting to Stalingrad, with 14% citing historical significance and 12% referencing the memory of the Great Patriotic War. Meanwhile, 21% of those who oppose the name change believe it would be expensive, 12% consider it pointless, and 11% think it is too focused on the past. Putin has stated that he would not object to the renaming if the residents of Volgograd support it. The 80th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad will be commemorated this week, and Putin is expected to visit the city.
The perception by the west and the world in general was of this powerful military machine ranked 2nd or 3rd as one if the most powerful and more disciplined militaries in the world. Large grand military parades showing off hundreds of tanks and missiles etc. It would be safe to say how shocked many off us are at how incompetent and very ordinary the Russian army and airforce are. That they failed miserably in their invasion attempt and have only just after 7 months had to resort to a desperate national mobilisation to support a laughable "special military operation" that is collapsing at the edges daily. It's shows that the Russians are no match for a motivated and western trained Ukraine with mostly Soviet weapons ( with western appliances as well but still predominantly Soviet era) let alone ever becoming a threat to a western army.
Ukraine has a crazy WW2 history too. They have the 3rd highest casualty rate of any group within the combined Soviet Red Army. The only groups with higher rates was Belarus. Followed by Soviet Jews.

The reason Soviet Jews top the list is because they as often had to fight off the Soviets in addition to the Nazis. So many chose to blend in with their local nationalities.

Their main fallback, which they seem to acknowledge is that they are no match for Nato at all and have had to resort to nuclear threats ... and so quickly.

If Ukraine can stomp out a Russian invasion just imagine how Russia would actually fare against the combined might of the West. If they didn't have Nukes they'd have nothing.
His academic history is also very suspect. He claims to have been in a PhD program, but there is no evidence of that. He likely never completed an undergraduate degree, yet he claims to have two (he's told different, conflicting stories about this over the years). He claims that his educational background in physics, engineering, computers, etc makes him a legit engineer, but his university studies were in economics. It's possible that he violated the terms of his student visa by leaving his university to move to California with his brother to start a business; so he might have been an illegal immigrant for a time and violated numerous laws when starting his business career.

I was wondering just how far they would let trump and his ridiculousness go before they pulled the "we never liked him" "who is he?" etc. Turns out even treason wasn't enough for some of them it was only when they lost the more sane of their voter base did they turn on him.

I have thought from time to time that if I ever just wanted to get super rich and powerful, the easiest way would be to throw all of my morals and self respect out the window and join the GOP. I could just lie about anything and everything to a bunch of dumb hick rubes and take all their money while laughing all the way to the bank.

They are upset about things but they accuse innocent people while ignoring those who are actually doing the thing. None of them gave a shit about or knew about Balenciaga until Tucker Carlson did a fear mongering show about them, now they’re doing Qanon shit to circle things in pictures to back up their conspiracy theories. It’s pathetic and destructive.

Crimea is not currently a war zone, and the worst thing that can happen in this situation is a major bloodshed on the Crimean territory during the attempts to reclaim the "rightful clay" and restore the "historical justice".
Because that's what typically happens when territories and their recognition by states are put first, and zero fucks are given about the population.

We are already tired of this shit, a lot of Crimeans have left for Ukraine, someone has moved to Russia, the local population is disappearing and being replaced by Russians from Moscow who have a lot of money, which locals consider to be slaves. Why pay more? All these places are occupied by visiting Russians, housing is being built for wealthy Russians, and local people work for 20,000 rubles ($ 300 per month). Of course, many new "Crimeans" (Russians) will be against joining back to Ukraine, since there are already half of them here. They came to us under 1 million from Russia and they are afraid of losing their property that was bought cheap or taken away by force from locals.

Crimeans are very passive and it played a very cruel joke. We lived quietly, but the desire for "historical justice" of the neighboring country made our life very difficult. And yes, I'm talking about the one who started this war.

1. Crimea used to be controlled by Ukraine until 9 years ago. People born back then are literally fucking not out of elementary school. It's not, "historical justice", because that would imply they are trying trying to reclaim territory that they lost decades or centuries ago. It's a recent, ongoing conflict.

2. Crimea IS Ukrainian territory. It is widely recognized as such by almost every country in the world, and the Russian annexation of it breached the international law in multiple ways.

While I agree with all your other points, the Russian colonization of Crimea has been a very long process and most of the colonizers there were not just from the past decade. It has been going on for centuries at various times, and especially took off once Soviets took control and deported the Tatars to Siberia in 1944. Some Tatars even came back after the USSR collapsed, but not nearly as many were there originally.
> When the film was released an FBI spokesperson acknowledged that Abagnale had given lectures at the Academy "from time to time," but denied that Abagnale had been given commendations by the agency as claimed in the film's marketing.[100] At no point has the FBI made an official statement corroborating Abagnale's biographical claims, nor has the agency confirmed his extraordinary claims that he was sent into a military base as an expert on missiles, and into a secret lab in New Mexico.[46][101] Abagnale has claimed in public lectures that he was discussed in detail in a coffee table book celebrating 100 years of the FBI.[46] However, Abagnale's name does not appear anywhere in the official book celebrating 100 years of the FBI.[102] In his public lectures Abagnale has taken on a pseudo-spokesperson role for the FBI.

Honestly thanks for this. I do pee in the shower often (I live alone, and I clean my shower constantly). Recently i've noticed urges to pee ALL the time i hear water and my bladder control seems really bad because im not using my pelvic floor muscles to hold it. When im out an about I have to find bathrooms way more often. So honestly, thanks for this. Good Doctor. I will stop peeing in the shower.

I'm a little surprised that Schiff is running. He's a force of nature in the house. Perhaps he was going for whip and didn't get it? Either way, he's a credit to government.

The reality is Schiff has gotten a lot done, and pPorter seems like she wants to work as well. Both good choices. Shame that one will definitely lose out, since we need good choices in many areas where we only have bad ones.
They made billions charging us to use the port of Karachi during 20 years in Afghanistan. Fuck Pakistan and their corrupt warlords and human rights abuses. Not to mention treating women like slaves.
It’s amazing how you can mention “human rights abuses” and the Afghan war in the same sentence an not have those connected. Home boy you were committing war crimes in Afghanistan in those 20 years. 95% civilian casualties in thousands of drone strikes. Brought pedophiles into the government there. Bush, Obama and Biden have been the most destabilizing administrations the world has seen since WW2.

Yes, such an insightful commentary from our distinguished diplomat. US has lost 20 years and billions of dollars in Pak and Afg. If they still think it's a viable strategy to balance out India, they're blind to the fact that those economies of scale are vastly different in all major factors and are just pushing their money in a bottomless pit.

Hope Hicks, she got down on her hands and knees, begged me for a Job ok, "please, Sir, please give me a Job," I said ok, and she did good, but then the Radical Left somehow got to her, and all of a sudden she now loves Crazy Nancy and Obama, can you believe it? you take a look, Very Innocent President, not like Obama or Sleepy Joe who only want to hurt our Country and hurt our Great Constitution, and nobody knows more about it than I do. and I should really be thanked a lot more if we're being honest about it, the Fake News never gives me credit, it's a horrible shame. ok, no more questions, especially not from the Fake News.

I was raised Christian around good people thanks to my beyond awesome grandpa. Once I stopped going to the church I went to (moved to the states) I full on stopped going to church. It was fucking night and day. If I was hanging around the people who were going to heaven at the churches I’ve seen in the states, I’d opt out. Luckily I get how that is gonna go for those people. They think just saying their are Christian is the key. You actually have to live like one and they don’t seem to get it. They are using a religion as a bartering tool and a weapon, which naturally means I can’t stand it. Solo worship ftw. Call out all the hypocrites you encounter. “You’re going to hell.” We aren’t supposed to judge. “Sex outside of marriage is a sin” you fucked your man in 12th grade Karen and you married him after college. “Man shall not sleep with man” that was a revision, it’s man shall not sleep with boy. If they believe everything in the book (king James and the other translated versions) without question, then they are just pawns in a crooked men’s schemes.
Tell that to the USA Congress, only the foot soldier are getting prosecuted while the top level agitators where promote to be in charge of the House in Congress.
Oh yeah. Totally have access to the LAPD entire armory, bro. I like Putin so much, I'll give him all, man.

Sheriffs in Louisiana are allowed to deputize whoever the fuck they want. No certifications or training required so long as they're accompanied by a certified officer.

My favorite part is when the show claims he was deputized in the 80s and shows a grainy black and white photo clearly showing Seagal in all his 2000s fatness. Or all the law enforcement certificatons he claimed to have, all of which have been refuted by the issuing authorities.
Hopefully enough Russians who don't want a nuclear war will remain behind because I'd hate to think of what might happen if those responsible for manning their nuclear arsenal get replaced with fanatics.
In RuZZia's perspective as , the word Nazi means anyone that is against Russia. Hence why Putin and his band of shitty people that should be hanged from the nearest street lamp can accuse the Jews of being Nazis. You're not dealing with logical actors, you're dealing with crazy idiots that may as well be an incontinent cow after weeks of eating Taco Bell in regard to all the shit that comes out of them.

I mean, if they were all fanatics there wouldn't be so many deserters, defectors, saboteurs or people who used to protest Putin until they felt they couldn't win against him anymore.

There was a Russian Christmas propaganda video circling about recently, and it immediately reminded me of that song. You can see right through their facade.

Oh definitely many were. My point was that not every single Russian is a fanatic, and as long as enough of those along the chain of command that would be used to launch their nuclear arsenal don't want to die it could potentially prevent a nuclear holocaust. If every single person on that chain is fanatically loyal to Putin it's far more likely that a nuclear exchange might happen if Putin ordered it.

In reality these claims along with those espousing Putin having cancer rely almost entirely on conjecture perpetrated by less than reliable news sources(tabloids).

But think about it like this, if things like this were happening in the Russian top brass on a large scale then what excuse would Russians have not to protest? If his claims are true then Russians are fully culpable for what is happening and are not oppressed whatsoever.

Depends on if Russians accept the prolonged sanctions or not, so far the reaction has been moderate to apathetic.

Carlin's point with this story was that, if you force your men to do horrific things to the enemy and local populace, they will hate you forever, and will do the same to you if not worse if you were ever overcome by them. While I think it's definitely a scare tactic to perpetrate these horrific acts against the Iranian people, it might also be that the regime is trying to force their own enforcers into a situation where they must fight to maintain power to the bitter end. That way, those in charge either keep power, or can at least buy themselves enough time to escape.
I'm so on the fence about it. I loved CK3 and love strategy games, but everything before CK3 was a little too much; and trust me, I tried to learn CK2, HOI4, Vic2, Stellaris.

Its so crazy to me that their government/leaders/police are so willing to just murder. Hopefully they are able to make change but id imagine it wont happen any time soon and with more bloodshed. Sad world we live in.
When I become dictator of the world and institute free healthcare it will then become child abuse to do blatantly evil things such as this. How dare those parents place their child’s lives at risk because of their own stupidity.

So what I was taught in bioethics - at least for the US - is that the physician can overrule parental decisions like this in the situation where the child’s life is at risk. So for example - if a child is under the age of 12, and they’re a Jehovah’s Witness, and parents refuse blood transfusion on grounds of religion, physician can overrule that decision (going through correct channels of course).

They’re saying that once people aren’t fearing for their lives about not being able to meet basic life requirements people will become paranoid and evil.
If the headline wasn't heavily editorialized (which it is), it would have worried me. It is one thing that a head of state is afraid of the consequences of using nuclear weapons in a scenario where more nuclear weapons could be used as retaliation (a completely legitimate fear, in my view). It is an entirely different thing that the FSB, an organization that controls the Russian deep state and is full of far right nationalistic elements, characterizes their own leader as "afraid" of using nuclear weapons, because that would mean that whoever succeeded him might be tempted to show the bravado of bringing us towards the end of the world just to keep his own clique in line.
You do know that in order to detonate a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb and create the temperatures and pressures necessary for fusion you have to build it inside of a fission bomb with traditional radioactive material like plutonium or uranium right? Hydrogen bombs still have radiation, though I’ll be honest I don’t know the difference in radiation levels between a straight up fission bomb or a fusion bomb detonated by fission.

Trump got a lot of crazies to vote who previously didn't, and won't if Trump himself isn't on the ballot (we saw it in the midterms, the GA runoff, and here) and the most sycophantic of his devotees think the Democrats have full control over elections so it's not worth it to vote because "the fix is in". Desantis probably won't be able to rile up that far right contingent enough to vote or get out of their conspiracy theories.

Trump loyalists weren't party loyalists. Trump was on the ballot for people who hated him, but he wasn't on the ballot for people who loved only him. DeSantis is going to have to go on the offensive at some point or he will go the way of Trump's primary challengers in 2015. The party wanted any of those people and look what happened.

When I called, they asked me if I wanted an ambulance, someone to talk to in person, or just talk on the phone. I asked for someone to come over, and two people from a local suicide prevention center (behind the Taco Bell around the corner - I had no idea) came and talked with me. They didn't pressure me or anything like that. They just wanted to assist me with whatever option I choose.

Your own chart shows you are wrong. It shows that Israel did in fact evacuate the Gaza strip and between 2004-2007 there were actually less settlers coming to the WB then the years before. Because it's not related.

Imagine what would happen if the evacuation resulted in more peace instead of violence. Imagine the huge support that would have been even from within Israelis to remove settlers from the WB as well. Even now millions of us (Like me) support it, but many stopped caring because it's factually not helping at all.

And calling Israel "Colonial" is extremely ignorant and dishonest. It is a fact that our country has given up more land mass than it's entire size in favor of peace. It is also a fact that this area was offered to the Palestinians 5 different times already. All refused in favor of violence.

All that said, I am still against the settlements, as millions of other Israelis. Simply because if some future Palestinian leader will ever be brave and smart enough to actually attempt peace, they would make drawing the borders pretty hard.

Do you know what their declared and public goal is? Let me tell you because you obviously don't. It's not to free the WB, but the destruction of Israel. It is literally the first item in their covenant. Go Google it if you don't believe me.

Yeah, I guess. Ignore the West Bank and 2005-2015 Israel isn’t bad at all for the great majority of Jews, many if not most Druze and Christians, and even some Palestinian Muslim citizens of Israel.

I'm not defending the rocket attacks but if Israel makes the West Bank like Gaza in terms of domination of borders then there won't be peace either.

Correct. You don't seem to have a grasp of what is happening, but the challengers took issue with one particular aspect of the original proposal, which they then changed. The poster is giving Biden credit for making a change that should streamline the appeal, not blaming him for it being appealed in the first place.
That’s not true. The German army was basically stripped to the bone. The German Air Force was prohibited from having planes and the German Navy was confiscated. Parts of western Germany were occupied by the French and British and war reparations levied as part of the Versailles Treaty were ruinous to the German economy. The Germans knew that they lost the war but the emerging far right in the 1920s and 30s blamed communists and Jews on the home front for stabbing the German Army in the back and losing the war. It was all bullshit because the German Army was crumbling during the Hundred-Days Offensive and would have completely collapsed had the war not ended on 11 Nov 1918.
How could anyone trust Russia to keep to its side of a negotiated settlement anyway. They've done nothing but lie. I can't help but think they'd use any ceasefire as an opportunity to re-arm and attack again.

Of course they are pathological liars, you’re dealing basically with a 90s mob who came to power and is thinking everyone’s intelligence is inferior to their own. Yet here they are losing everywhere and making these statements for the sake of statements. The talking mustache here is universally a meme here that goes: “I know nothing, please stop asking me your fucking questions”. Or making these dumb cringe claims.

A few things and more, but the ones that stand out is the power to defund anyone who investigates them and to overturn the hard-fought labor unions for staffers.

You didn't even touch requiring a super majority (3/5ths) to raise any taxes, or requiring cuts somewhere else in the budget to add or increase spending in a specific area, even if it is completely paid for by other means.

Doesn't really matter what McCarthy agreed to because he cannot unilateral decide House rules. However McCarthy will undoubtedly get all the blame for anything that doesn't pass, and the likely consequence of that is a primary challenge. Probably why most Republican House members were happy to let him take the fall by being the Speaker.

We may share the same physical space and legal framework as conservatives but the two sides live in completely different worlds. One side believes in the myth of bipartisanship and respecting the rights of minorities and the other is one smart, charismatic leader away from becoming the Eden's Gate cult from Far Cry 5. How do you govern a country where 30% of the population believes they're in a holy war against literal demons?

This country has a severe empathy gap between the two parties that likely can't be repaired. Biden keeps trying to work with the Republicans and attempt to actually run a government while the Republicans are only concerned with consolidating power and harming minority groups who don't fit in with their Christian nationalist utopian worldview.
Unfortunately sometimes the path to true peace is to fight. If Ukraine negotiates with Russia, and the resulting agreement ends with Russia holding any more land than when they started this war the lesson will be that military conquest is still a viable strategy, and it will only be a matter of time before Putin decides to take another bite, or someone else decides to attack their neighbour, because, hey it worked for Russia. And if a peace is agreed to, the sanctions will probably be lifted, and the lesson taken from that will be that if you can tough out the sanctions and force your opponent to the negotiation table the sanctions will disappear, which will only encourage escalation.
Peace is a good goal, but without looking at the consequences and the lessons that will be taught, it will only be a fleeting thing.

In my opinion, a large part of the cause of WW2 were the conditions attached to the peace after WW1, and Chamberlain's proclamation of "peace in our time" probably increased the chances of a large scale war, when a less peaceful response might have averted the conflict escalating to the point that it did...

Neville Chamberlain takes all the blame but people need to remember that the UK and France were democracies and that another war with Germany was wholly unpopular. Sure, we have the benefit of hindsight and knowing that France could have entirely destroyed the German state had they invaded while Germany was busy invading Poland... But the world doesn't work that way. A more aggressive posture from Chamberlain at the time likely would have just resulted in him being forced to resign.

As you rightfully point to the Treaty of Versailles as in many ways creating a scenario that would inevitably lead to a second war, have to understand that Russians feel the same way about the break up of the Soviet Union.

Recall the first world war, and the infamous Treaty of Brest Litovsk that ended the Russian Empires participation in the war. I think people forget that unlike in WW2, in the Great War Germany actually won on the eastern front and forced Russian surrender. This treaty would have deprived the Russian Empire of Finland, the Baltic States, and Ukraine.. This was seen as so cruel and intolerable that the Western Allies reversed it at the end of the war.

Now, compare the European territory lost in the to the European territory lost in the and you start to understand the Russian perspective. Territory that the entire world once understood to be Russian and allowed to remain so despite German conquest, less than 80 years later, a single lifetime, the world now acts like that territory should have never been Russian to begin with..

To be clear I'm not suggesting Russia should reconquer Soviet states, even if she were militarily capable of that. My point is only that a basis for an honest peace with Russia would be better if the West used Putins own logic against him rather than negotiate from a position of idealism.

While there might be a semblance of truth to Putins claim that the end of WW2/USSR left the world with historically anachronistic borders, it would be good to remind him that Russia benefited from that as well, namely Kaliningrad in Europe and the Kuril/Sakhalin island of Japan. The cession of those territories should be the first thing in any deal to recognize Crimea.

And for the record, this resulting agreement that military conquest is still a viable strategy against countries not in NATO is simply the status quo since NATOs inception. Changes nothing.

Yeah, Versailles was a terrible solution in hindsight. But Germany had quite a bit of culpability in the millions of lives lost in the war, and the harsh terms can be understood from that perspective.

The comparison between the treaty of Versailles and the collapse of the USSR seems like one hell of a false equivalence, and suggesting anybody cater to it seems like trying to beat Putin at a rigged game.

The USSR collapsed under its own weight. The other Soviet states chose to become independent. It’s literally nothing but petulant entitlement for the Russian Federation to lay claim to any part of them now.

If they want a more regional power base to counter NATO, perhaps they should try diplomacy rather than dick swinging, manipulation and conquest.

Russia is not serious about peace negotiation. Putin must be dreaming that no matter how painful it is Russia will emerge as final victor except as time passes he will be strangulated financially, his military ruined, his country end up as pariah of the West.

At the rate Russia is losing its hardware the military is having difficult time replacing so much so that army is reactivating Soviet era battle tank that has sat in mothball for decades.

Their air force was supposed to clear the sky of Ukrainian air force but failed to do so and instead are getting shot down so much so that they rarely make sortie into Ukrainian territory.

Their navy have suffered major embarrassment when guided missile cruiser Moskova was sunk by Ukrainian cruise missiles and navy was forced to restrict movement of their ships in Black Sea due to fear of losing more ships.

I read that estimated Russian troops killed in action or wounded already surpassed 100,000. That is a loss hard to swallow especially when Russia is on its way to shrinking population even before the war.
I don't think Trump ought to call DeSantis Meatball Ron. Meatball Ron is an unfriendly name. Meatball Ron is undignified. Meatball Ron is not something you should call a governor. Meatball Ron is vague and indefinable. Meatball Ron could stick and hound the man forever. Meatball Ron could become how Floridians refer to their governor. Meatball Ron could become accepted through repetition rather than appropriateness. "Meatball Ron": what do you, as a Reddit user, really think about the name Meatball Ron? I bet Meatball Ron doesn't like it, but I like it, do you hear, Meatball Ron?

Aw gee, we're gonna talk about considering it, and then after that we'll have a series of committee meetings over the span of 8 years, and we'll definitely figure out what we're gonna do then... ARGH OMG these people are so lame And when MAGA takes over the house they're going to haul Democrats in by their hair and hand out indictments like they're candy.

Everyday they waste time with this bullshit, Trump and his band of criminal supporters, many of whom are still in incredibly powerful positions (cough cough looking at you Clarence) remain free and continue to cause harm that will only take more time to fix.
And when it didn't, did she lose faith? Or maybe she thought somebody scammed her by selling her fake holy water...
Agreed. Gay people don’t have a choice under Christianity but to live a life in the closet, or to live a double life. Most Christians are homophobic pieces of shit. Especially Catholics who pretend that their religion didn’t rape and murder millions of people in the name of God. I’ll be clear in that i believe in the faith that people have in Jesus, but I hate the institutions and I especially hate their hateful, mysoginistic and homophobic preaching. Gay people deserve better than to be a part of that bullshit. There are better ways of belonging in the world - of being a part of a civilized and inclusive society - which gives people a sense of meaning and fulfillment. Fellowship isn’t relegated to only the church with its typical hypocritical male at the pulpit.

The fact that they didn't burn or melt upon contact with the holy water should be a pretty clear indicator to this woman that at least some portion of her beliefs are incorrect.
I know people who worked in the ministries of Indigenous Affairs (both provincial and federal). The tribes that manage it well, do it REALLY well. The ones that don't...they tend to be the ones on the news a lot.
That's why whenever the gov't just throws money at the problem, I roll my eyes and shrug. It won't help as much as people think. And when it's even suggested that those problems need to be tackled, the ones at risk of being exposed will often be the loudest to cry out about the injustices and use the past as a shield.

Agreed, however that is their affair to handle. They do not want government support or projects (for often good reasons) so the govt is now tryi g to deal with each nation as it's own nation. This makes projecta very slow but does build trust in our institutions and helps our relationships with these nations. I hope it all gets invested wisely but as you said people are people.

Insofar as it's their affairs to handle; there are MANY situations where the gov't provided funding for a project that their leadership wanted to handle. They then went "no more money, need more" but somehow, their leadership became considerably more well off.

The government is actually contractually restrained from doing a lot of the things that would help because of NAFTA or whatever the new abberation is called. Basically, our military has the engineering knowledge and ability but that would put the gov't in a position of competing in "possibly lucrative" projects. It's quite messed up as far as that goes.

There are no easy answer, like I said above. I don't know if just throwing money at them and letting them keep screwing over their own people really is the answer though. There's real suffering going on while rich people do rich people things. Like I said, there are large examples across canada of nations really doing it right. But there are some that break my heart when I hear what's happening because it's not for lack of resources, I assure you.

Oh I agree, however corruption is a human problem and it is not the govt of Canada's role to manage the 600ish first nations territories eithin the larger borders. They want autonomy and so they somewhat have it. Its up to them to change for themselves. Investing in community services and local businesses could help a lot of people.

One community I worked with had communal businesses including a gas station and a fishing boat (I do mean a modern boat with hydrolics and whatnot) as long as it is reinvested into the community so they can grow its a good thing.

Typically when communities have investment they tend to grow. Some corruption is inevitable but thays a human problem in general.

I agree. It does become the govt's problem when they turn around and put out public blasts saying they're not being helped though. It's a situation of them wanting their cake and to eat it too. But that is hardly unique to this situation, when you look at the world as a whole.

The money for that stuff is already budgeted. Government spends over $20 billion a year on that stuff.

The one positive thing this MIGHT do is help build some degree of trust between the federal government and indigenous communities, because that's probably the biggest hindrance to good governance.

Now it's about building strong working relationships between government agencies and indigenous communities. They've been mistreated for so long it's understandable they are hesitant, but the feds just throwing dump trucks of money at them and covering their eyes is no solution.

I think there is a mixed approach method being used for the water filtration plants and other projects. Its very slow going and im not sure all the funds have been spent. Its now funded by the fed but deals with the first nations on their terms.

Money does make a difference. As soon as Edenburgh starting investing in Ireland people could get the money they needed and the potato famine ended and people began starting small businesses and expanding productivity again. The wealth of nations was a popular book at the time and was used to justify the ruining of that state, when more investments happened the peasants began to have money to invest and improve their lot.

Fundamentally though, the government is still committing cultural genocide to this day. Sure, kids aren't being taken to TB-infested boarding schools, but their education remains completely Western-style (not to mention nearly all post-secondary institutions retain white colonialist structures, methods, and knowledge). Kids no longer need to cut their hair, but they're still largely trained to think and act like good European subjects, which is arguably the more important aspect of culture (rather than aesthetics).
Her political theatrics were cringey (kente cloth taking a knee for example), and her position on investment rules for house members were not great. BUT her political prowess was unmatched. When she passed the ACA, she knew that vote would probably cost a lot of moderate democrats their seats, but she got them to do it. As fractious as the democratic coalition was, she got them to stick together when it mattered to pass major legislation. The Democratic Party needs fresh faces, but damn was it a sigh of relief that Nancy had the wheel in the Trump years.

When everyone went to working from home, commercial occupancies dropped 30 percent. Companies looked to become residential landlords instead. Rent skyrocketed and people lost housing nationwide. To think that's a city problem is naive.
It galls me to hear Jim Jordan or Matt Gaetz talk about how we are "spending money we don't have" when they are trying to directly hobble the governments revenue by making it easy for the rich to evade taxes and hide their assets.
The IRS goes after the poor because it doesn't have the resources to go after the rich, who can afford armies of accountants and lawyers.

This is like the 20th article I've seen on this, they didn't admit to enriching uranium to 84%, they just admitted that someone has said they did. They are still denying it.Why is this news.
I'll imagine it'll take more than a missile strike. You'll probably find a lot of the infrastructure is underground/far away from Israel. If it was ad simple as a missile strike they would of done it by now.

The moment a nation builds a nuclear stockpile is the moment it becomes so much harder to mess with that nation. Any military action taken against a nuclear-armed nation becomes much riskier due to the possibility of nuclear retaliation.

Not really , countries with nukes can potentially fight them as MAD policy comes in which prevents both from using nukes but conventional war and weakening the other guy works , what Iran needs to do is build a stockpile of nukes( about 200, the region’s average amount ) and missile systems and then do a test to publicly show the world that they are a nuclear country , after that it depends on politics , whether war or discussions occur , the only thing that is stopping Iran from doing the above is that they signed the NPT so they can’t legally make nukes , while Israel , Pakistan and India didn’t sign the treaty and thus were allowed to keep their nukes as they weren’t subject to the NPT and negotiations occurred which led to the power heiarchy of the world to remain stable.
I work at a delivery service that has been around for 300 years or so? We have people who've put in 10 years plus who are either leaving or going medical-8. I know people who have already made double their salary in overtime and penalty time because we have been that short staffed with "peak season volume" all goddamn year since covid. We have zero holiday help. We are going into the third year of the worst peak season ever ( I keep hearing the word "unprecedented") and yet not a fucking peep from up top.
I have had total meltdowns in the back of my vehicle with my boss on the phone. I cry when I drive home from work because my body physically hurts everywhere and I'm getting home after my kids have fallen asleep. I fucking love the holidays but my career choice is slowly burning that away.

I have no idea what kind of rabbit they are going to pull out of their hats to fix this, but there isn't enough right now to keep anyone worth a damn because who wants to work 15 hours days? "OH and hey, when you're done doing this here, you're going to have to go across town and work till 10 pm because they had 8 sick calls.".

I loved this job before covid. My station manager has basically tanked his own career because he has told his bosses to piss off and leave our station alone. (We are the only station that isn't under water right now.) I hope for the sake of this wonderful service that has been serving the public that they pull their heads out of their asses, but my hope is dwindling. Please, be patient with your delivery services. It's not just my company. It's all of us. Amazon can't even handle their volume and yet they expect us to do the impossible. God speed, everyone.

This is being used against them unfortunately which in turn, hurts everyone. It's partly why wages have stagnated incredibly.

Yep, and another tough reality to hear is that immigrants are their own enemy. They are much too compliant to stick up for themselves for fear of going against any sort of "authority" figure.

It's time for Indians and Chinese to start talking to their relatives back home and either tell them to not be pylons and get walked all over, or simply just don't come at all because they will not have an easier time here.

If you live in Canada the plan is clearly to import hordes of third world immigrants, “temporary foreign workers”, and “international students”, pay them bare survival wages, house them 4 to a bedroom, and exploit them to death with the threat of deportation to keep them powerless.

It sucks because I'm a son of 2 immigrant parents and they have some remnants of that type of attitude, luckily they immigrated during a time where Canada didn't take advantage of them as they do now and it was an actual country of opportunity.

Can you isolate if there is more mental illness, or if people now are more comfortable mentioning that mental illness is the cause of their sick leave? People rarely if ever used to specify that they were suffering from a mental illness. They would use the reason of a more socially acceptable, non-stigmatized illness for their sick leave.

Bro I don't even remember a tenth of the failures of the courts under Modi..but I do know even judges are embaressed by the courts right now. Yet being the spineless greedy men/women they are they go along with it for personal gain/safety.
I say it again - this is to be expected a lot more now. Because this ultra far right govt will fuck shit up now and stir things up. Hardliners will now be emboldened more than ever. Things will be bad for next few years for the region, esp. for Palestinians. This, entering the mosque, and palestinian flag incidents are just a start.
Don't think this will be another war... at first I thought Israel was invading Jordan but it seems like they want to annex part of the West Bank thats called the Jordan Valley, not actual Jordan. From the bit of research I just did it seems like Israel already controls this eastern part of the West Bank with mostly jews living there with the exception of Jericho and Al-Auja. So pretty much they wanna turn their unofficial control into official control by claiming it as Israel proper. It'll be condemned by world leaders but I don't think it'll start a war since Palestinians don't have an army and Jordan isn't being invaded.

I think a lot of people, like me, assumed from the title that Israel wants to annex or invade part of Jordan. And given that most of this area is already controlled by Israeli forces and has a majority jewish population I don't see it causing a civil war either. Of course this is ignoring all the morality and ethics of the situation this is just a pragmatic view of it.
The US is perfectly capable of dealing with two fronts at once, as seen in WW2. The response to Russia is in many ways also a message to China, as well as a way to rally major industrialized democratic countries in its favor, not just against Russia, but against China. Of the three (US, China and Russia), the US has by far the best demographic dividends, and has the most advantages overall. Furthermore, Chinese foreign policy has not made a friend in India, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and even the Phillipines, hence of great benefit to the US. The US has the Chinese coast largely surrounded: the Chinese have only real long term security as of now in the interior of Eurasia. Even the Indian OCean is much less secure (via Myanmar and Pakistan), because the US is the dominant naval global power and India is right there in the region. The Chinese need Russia to control Central Asia, and China needs both to control the Eurasian interior. Turkey is also of great importance for this reason.
Xi literally promised Ukraine a nuclear umbrella, among a wide range of other security guarantees. Xi should have been sending weapons to Zelensky a year ago, if he had any honor.
There are still more boomers out there as of today. Trump is the first person to hold the office who has made it clear he has not read The Constitution and the little he knows of it he finds repulsive. He's a boomer and holds sway over many boomers. The boomers are the first generation in American history to deliberately trash the legacy of their parents and attempt to destroy the future of their children. Once they destroy The Constitution, we are all fucked. Once it's gone, no one gets to keep anything. Nothing. Boomers were also known as the "me" generation, nothing matters to them at all. Not a damn thing.

And which religon could take power in USA? Baptists, catholics, jews, scientologists or spagetthi monster? There is just too many of them in US for any of them to take full control 😉.
And it’s actually important to have the freedom of religion… like choose your own spiritual beliefs about life and death. Some people like a mix of philosophy and science.

Not a politician here, but for now it may be beneficial to keep luka where he is until putin and his regime gets removed. Otherwise putin may 'annex' Belarus. This way putin has his clown there who is a moron but at the same appears to keep his distance from putin.

If Putin goes it's going to be the head of Wagner group or Chechnya that seize power. Russia and the world will be no better off. Many, many people need to be removed from influence and power in order for Russia to have an optimal path forward. Those people that should be in power aren't ruthless enough to seize it.

And considering the Kadyrovite “elite” units have proven to be as much a paper tiger as the Russian military as whole has. If you’re referring to the Chechen mafia which displaced the ethnic Russian mafia at home then I would also say that’s probably pretty unrealistic.

I don’t like that idea, as much as I’m a progressive I also believe that states need to be linguistically rather than racially or ethnically homogenous. Thus I would support the annexation of the remaining polish and/or Lithuanian speaking communities that are contiguous with their home countries. The rest of Belarus, the Belarusian and most likely Russian speaking areas as well smooth the sake of not making an unholy landmass of a country akin to Middle Francia.
But in all seriousness, Turkey’s rampant inflation and collapsing economy is going to have major implications for the whole world and make other countries and the region less stable.
I feel like 85% inflation basically means you are in a failed economy and failed state. I mean what’s the point of working, saving, investing at that point? Other than to meet your basic needs. All trust in the financial system is lost and nobody will want to participate again for a very long time.

If you reach a high enough inflation rate, how do you get people to even work anymore…??? Like 85% inflation means money is becoming quite worthless, and the financial system that is supposed to support the economy is failed.

85% is not close to hyperinflation. Rule of thumb is it needs to be 50% per month which per year is 12,874.63%.

There was mention of Russian passports being found, so I'm guessing they were counting on aid from Russia. Eastern Germany was part of the Soviet Union, so Russia still tries to exert influence in the region.

The gun wasn't the problem. The gun laws weren't the problem. This is a prime example of why people say "gun free zone" signs do nothing. Because in this case it did nothing. Adding more laws wouldn't have fixed this. Enforcing the already present ones would have.

Numerous laws were broken which allowed this minor to even get a hold of this firearm, so adding more laws wouldn't help. Numerous laws were broken which allowed this minor to take this firearm into a place that firearms are not allowed, so more laws wouldn't help. Numerous laws that could be created for this incident could also be circumvented just as easily. The only one that would "work" would be to ban all guns, but as we all know, thats a pipe dream so it's not a good argument.

TLDR: Tons of laws were broken here. All these laws were easily circumvented and are hardly enforced. We should be enforcing them more, rather than adding more laws that are also easily circumvented. That's the solution I'm discussing. Not banning all guns. Not ridiculous sarcastic and villainous comments about shooting a 6 year old.

People putting up a sign saying that it's a gun free zone didn't stop this literal child from obtaining a gun. A law in VA that makes it illegal to hold a firearm in a way a child could take possession of it didn't stop this.

Since this is clearly going over your head, my statement was about how the law clearly didn't stop someone from being shot, even accidentally. Someone broke the law. The parents broke the law. We should enforce the laws on the parents and make an example out of them.

Yes, clearly "ban all guns" would solve this from ever happening again, but there is no way to actually get there, so it's a non-starter of a discussion.

Most people absolutely do support laws that punish irresponsible gun owners. The thing is, they already exist, just are either hard to or are never actually enforced.

Yep, and you just got a slew of down votes for stating the blindingly obvious: There is absolutely no fucking way that America could transition to a zero gun society overnight.

Gun control needs to be brought in gradually enough that it isn't rejected by gun proponents. Even laws that the majority of people should support have trouble. Witness Obama's no guns for mentally ill people getting cancelled by Trump. WTAF?

The GOP are children who are throwing a fit and don't want to pay unless the democrats give into their crazy demands, in hopes that they can somehow make the democrats look bad by not giving into their demands.

Debt ceiling shouldn't exist and is unconstitutional anyway (IANAL). Other countries don't have a similar concept. The money has been spent. Yes, it was spent via borrowing. Don't like that? Shouldn't have authorized it in the first place if you didn't want to pay the bill now that its due.

Furthermore, debt of a government is not akin to debt of a family household. So long as GDP is growing faster than the debt, debt is a good thing. You're growing faster because money is being spent. If you didn't spend that money, you'd be hurting economic growth and holding the country back. Again, so long as the growth outpaces the debt, then there's no issue with massive debt. Again, IF the economy is growing faster than the debt (and it almost always does). This is why America has a great credit rating. We're able to pay our debts -- until we choose not too. Not because we can't, but because we just decide not to pay. Something the United States has never done. Since George Washinon, the United States has made every single debt payment in its history. Republicans are going down the road we've never actually gone to the end of. Its beyond reckless.

Build up retirement homes near cities. Provide medical care, home care, friendship, activities there. Every week we have transportation send the inhabitants to down town city, cousin, beach. People can choose to move into the centers with friends or family member who are over 55 years old. They will on duty two days a week home care older people when hear bells ring for help. They will get the same services when they get old. Right now, government pay 25 dollars / hour and one to one service for low income people. The expenses can up to 300$ a day. In my proposal people are helping each other and saving home care expense for the government. The rest time they can take activities such dancing singing, play poker, sport, taking course they like. They can also work two hours in the garden every day for the organic food they need. They will have their own apartment, 700$ rent for a studio and 1100$ for one bedroom…. Government can make onetime investment for average 50,000/ unit.( The Chinese can make it for that price) As a big landlord, government can collect rent to offset its social security payments. In thirty years, government can triple up its investments. Why this proposals work?

One user jumped in and asked him about Sam Bankman-Fried's donations to Democrats, which I presume Hunter has no clue about. The host removed the person asking the idiotic question and Hunter continued to speak. Then Hunter's connection went out or a glitch with Twitter Spaces likely kicked him out. It's possible he left, but likely not the case.

Inna Yashchyshyn, a Russian agent posing as an heiress of the Rothschild fortune, was at Mar-a-Lago for no other purpose that I can think of than receiving classified documents to take back to Canada. Her ex boyfriend was shot 3 times as a warning, a typical KGB/GRU action.

Yet nobody acknowledges them officially as a sovereign country. Not the UN, none of any major countries in the world, not the US.
No way would China allow a base to be set up there either. That would be like China setting up a naval base in Cuba, except worse since China considers Taiwan part of China.

As far as the United Nations, they aren't a government and don't have the ability within international law to decide who is and isn't a country.

The United States absolutely acknowledged the transfer of sovereignty in 1952... as a matter of fact, they are the one that pushed for a peace agreement between the ROC and Japan (Treaty of Taipei).

When I was in Poland this past summer, we’d be chilling in the backyard at my grandmas house and every once in a while you’d see American military planes fly over. In the town I was staying in, there’s a lot of Ukrainian refugees. My family said they love seeing them fly by because it just shows power. It’s cool to see allies in action and in force. People forget that Poland went to Afghanistan and fought the Taliban alongside the US. It makes me proud that we can all stick together and defend Ukraine. It’s globally so overwhelmingly popular. Governments are tripping over themselves coming to aid. Poland just bought a buttload of South Korean tanks and were training alongside Korean troops this summer, which is pretty badass.
Russia understands one language only and that’s power and intimidation. You show weakness, you’re done. Think high school politics, and that’s how you navigate it.

Nah, the US imprisons about 500 people for every 100,000 of it citizens. That's about the same as the average estimates for North Korea, FYI. Russia imprisons only 300 people for every 100,000 of its citizens.

I believe (though am not an expert) even then it's not entrapment. You are still making a free choice to sell the coke. If th police said "we will kill your family if you don't" it would be entrapment.

No. Entrapment would be where a people wouldn’t have the means or possibly the thought to commit the crime, but law enforcement provides the tools/idea for it.

Though I might be horribly wrong but there are a lot of myths about entrapment. Partly spread by the police themselves to trick people.

That would not be entrapment either. The state will successfully argue that you were willing to sell drugs just fine. A law abiding citizen would decline. The police can give you the opportunity and even the tools to commit a crime without a problem. Entrapment is concerned with the state corrupting you to commit a crime you wouldn't otherwise have commited.

The fun part about state law though, is it matters what state you're in. This could be entrapment in certain states as long as specific criteria are met.

From the look of it, the police were going to confiscate $70k but when they got round to it it was gone. So instead they would find him that much abd the lawyer argued that it is cruel and unusual punishment because he can't pay it and will go to jail.

I've had that exact conversation with a Republican, before. When Dems follow through on their platform and campaign promises, that's bribing the voters. When a Republican does it, it's just "common sense".
That's huge, the UK just announced hundreds including bulldogs, with the potential for strikers from the US maybe to be announced. People are fixated on the tanks but other armoured deliveries seem to be ramping up a lot as well.
... And good IFVs that can quickly cross rough terrain in large numbers are definitely useful for offensives and breaking through lines. With ATGM everywhere, it's not that sure that having a few tens of tanks is better than a few hundreds of IFVs. Tanks seem to take a role as fire support now that they can be countered by squads with ATGM. They'll probably be a good complement for a spearhead with hundreds of IFVs, but not that decisive on their own.

I think what made the dike burst was Russia's second mobilization announcement. They're really going to try to flood the region with bodies in 2023, and it's given the West a sense of urgency that wasn't there before. They've got a window of probably about 6 months to arm several powerful Ukrainian mobile armored brigades and train those units for a big push.

Basically, everyone has realized that Ukraine can win this. Everyone realized that Russia wasn’t going to stop at gobbling up Ukraine, and the next targets included NATO countries and EU members. If Russia takes on NATO or the EU, that will likely turn into a full WWIII. So instead, once Ukraine showed they were willing to fight, the plan became to stop Russia in Ukraine.

It was thought at the start of the war that it would take 9-12 months for Ukraine to develop the logistics to handle NATO vehicles. It’s been 11 months and suddenly the NATO armory doors are being flung open wide.

So, it sounds like a lot more equipment from US surplus is about to be unloaded. The US usually lists those items with the cost to purchase them directly, even if they are the US getting rid of surplus equipment and saving on maintenance and storage. Still, great news. I wonder what toys Ukraine is getting.

You must remember, it was the Soviet Union, not Russia, that spent 10 years fighting in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union was a much more powerful country than modern-day Russia and losing all those people and money in Afghanistan helped lead to the Soviet Union breaking up. Losing 26k people and a ton of equipment in Afghanistan broke a wealthier and more powerful country than the modern Russian federation.

Never forget to remind that prominent Wagner members have a proven track record of neo nazi advocacy, but Russia doesn't give a damn. If they really wanted to fight nazism, they wouldn't rely on the services of Wagner mercenaries.

Ukraine’s favored tactic this war has been rope-a-dope. Right now Russia is full of strenh from the mobiks raised in the fall. Ukraine is letting Russia bleed men to get a few feet of ground, while generally preserving its own strenh. Once Russia exhausts the mobiks, which should happen soon since the current wave of mobiks have been thrown at Bakhmut in heavy waves for almost a month now. Russia officially raised 300,000 and sent half to Ukraine, concentrating them at Bakhmut and Soledar. If a force is meaningless when it has one man dead in ten and Russia loses 500 a day, Russia can’t go much longer with the current wave. That’s Ukraine’s cue to start pushing.
Ukraine’s favored tactic this war has been rope-a-dope. Right now Russia is full of strenh from the mobiks raised in the fall. Ukraine is letting Russia bleed men to get a few feet of ground, while generally preserving its own strenh. Once Russia exhausts the mobiks, which should happen soon since the current wave of mobiks have been thrown at Bakhmut in heavy waves for almost a month now.

Oh this old bit of propaganda. One of Russia’s favorite claims is that X is endless, so why bother. Now it is true that Russia can produce a certain number of missiles a month. However, from the reduced frequency of missile tantrums, it isn’t that many.

The debate between Madison and Hamilton style views about spending at the federal level has gone on for, literally, 100s of years, but until this year, it has never extended to the potus trying to do this type of thing. Even Joe Biden himself said that the potus didn’t have this power- up until this year, when he evidently changed his mind, of course.

Nowhere in the usc does it authorize anyone to authorize the potus to directly spend money or allocate funds.

You can’t say he bullshitted them when he actually followed through with his promise and it’s completely republicans stopping it. Don’t try and both sides this when it’s one side.

Evangelicals froth at the mouth over the thought of children learning that trans/gay/non-binary people exist; saying it is an attempt to indoctrinate children by exposing them to it early.

That’s why Christians go to work on people EARLY. If they can convince you that you were born an evil, worthless sack of shit right from the beginning they got you for LIFE. I am a former Christian and from a family of Christians and I can promise you that’s the absolute truth. It’s hard to believe this nonsense is still going on.

They’ve got about as much interest in what we think as a dog does in Microsoft Excel. They’d rather die and/or leave politics before giving a shit about us. Those psychos are only there in the first place for personal power and greed.

DeSantis has actually been passing tons of legislation. I think their strategy will evolve into passing stupid culture war laws that will get overturned or are in nobodies best interest, but they’ll give the bills a cool tag line and overwhelm people with propaganda until they want it.

Its not conservatives, it is this new wave of "MAGA-Republicans". These are people who are less ideologically driven and more so do/believe whatever the orange Umpalumpa posts on Truth Social. Luckily the traditional Neo-Cons still have a hard on for the military industrial complex, so the weapons will keep being shipped.
You see the problem is they heard that this could be a good thing and ran miles and miles in the other direction because they couldn't have their good name tarnished by something as trivial as helping people.

Nothing that Trump supported policy wise was new for conservatives, they all want the same bullshit he did, they just prefer to be less open about how terrible they are rather than announce it to the world as matter of pride. His overall goals were no different from countless Republicans before him.

Edit: also they want him gone because he hurts their ability to win, not as a matter of principle. If principle had even the smallest part to play in the decision, they wouldn't have ever voted for him.

We call them fascists, and they step in line to whatever their dogmatic dictator demands. Dear Leader says screw putin? They hate him. Next day Dear Leader says putin's the best? All hail Russia.
An arms dealer who is in no small part partially responsible for the critical lack of military hardware and ammunition that's killing Russian servicemen at an alarming rate and they applaud his safe return?

As I understand it Bout was a monster, but one that served Russian interests, so to them it was helping someone on their team. It's also not a popular trade so they enjoy that it undermines the White House's PR. It's unlikely they expect Bout to go back to business, his value is purely to be a fly in the ointment for American diplomacy.

People are forgetting Biden got Trevor Reed out of there earlier this year - another US military service member... Russia will arrest any Americans and trump up charges just to have a trade for when we inevitably catch more Russian spies. I think it's weird that people are upset that an American is free. Plus the fact that Griner was sent to a penal colony where she would've most likely died and Whelan is sitting in a prison in Moscow. Putin is playing right into US far-right propaganda. Look at social media and the reactions of conservatives. It's fueling more division, and that's what he wants.
A paper airplane powered by a nuclear powered ram jet and carrying several nuclear sub munitions. That was designed to fly super sonic at low altitude where the shock wave alone would have caused injury and damage to civilians and structures on the ground. The idea was to have it loiter after it deployed its sub munitions just spewing radioactive exhaust before it finally crashed. It was crazy, an absolutely insane weapon that only got axed because of the radar advancements you mentioned and the fact that ICBMs were cheaper and more reliable.
Do I get to mark "Turns out USA created Coronavirus in a lab" or only "Russia blames USA for Covid 19" ? I am learning toward the latter but I really need the former for a quick win.

So much this...we're just a bunch of idiots with money throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. We seriously researched a gay bomb. We built and tested the SLAM, a weapon so absolutely dooms day level insane it makes our current arsenal seem sedate. We're like Wylie Coyote over here.
I mean with the amount of bullshit flying around here about us, what do you expect? Even most people that aren't from germany have by now gotten the hint that the narrative "Merkel singlehandedly caused Putin to invade and now Germany does nothing because theyre all secretly on russias side" is utter bullshit, so the occasional troll gets downvoted.
That being said, regarding the topic: yeah, most people here are against the world cup, with a lot of people not watching it (example: me), because of the human rights situation, FIFA's greed and for the largest part (personal opinion) because of the insanity to play a football worldcup in a desert country that has no proper attachement to the sport.

I understand what you're saying about the whole Germany might as well just join Russia hyperbole that has somehow been reached at times. However I personally believe a balance is needed. We can recognize that Germany has some weird questionable priorities and is a bureaucratic mess which moves far too slowly. And still admit that it's one of the best Nations in Europe and does lots of things right.

Its just the objectively wrong stuff that gets me pissed off, like the Hamburg-Port-Sale-Bullshit, or the whole Germany-Secretly-Wants-Ukraine-To-Loose-Conspiracy, because its such an obvious attempt by some of the more populist people in Europe to shift blame and rally their voters with a common enemy.

Basically everytime something goes wrong somewhere in Europe, some people suddenly remember how we owe them a bazillion gazillion euros in reparations and how, whatever went wrong, is in no way their fault, but obviously Merkels/Scholz's/Hitlers, and its just tiring by now.

LNG burns a lot cleaner than coal, but it takes a lot of energy to liquify gas to liquid form. Even worse, at all stages LNG tends to leak methane which is horrible for the environment. How much methane is leaked or flared is up for debate, but recent literature suggests it's significant enough to be a legitimate concern that expanding coal plants may actually be a more environmentally friendly solution to shipping LNG long distances.
Why would Omar not be entitled to go through that commission process if they think having the process is so important? This is like negotiating with a rapist and saying ‘we got them to agree to no more rapes, but we had to allow them one more rape freebie before they would go through with the deal.’.

If it takes a few months for a nobody like me to run out of resources, then I can at least understand that the scale of what's happening with Russia is so far beyond my experience that it's not surprising when it takes a while for their failures to be obvious to those of us that aren't directly involved with the logistics.

Also doesn't help when the nominally-Democratic Mayor of NYC is on TV repeating Zeldin's talking points about crime ad-nauseum and lending validity to that attack point. You can even see the impact in other states that had some of their counties fall within the NYC media market (like CT/NJ/PA).

I'm startled something this detailed is coming out only after an election. Did everyone involved with opposition research for the New York Democratic Party just stick their heads collectively in the sand? Confirming claims about employment and education are things you'd typically catch early on in a cycle!

EDIT: Stumbled across , and from a cursory glance it looks like they spent a lot more time on digging into the things he said vs. the things he did (or claimed to do). Bullet points on the validity of his charity and shadiness on his financial disclosures are on pages 7 and 8, sandwiched in between some quotes of his about how "Biden's going to take your guns" and "Ukraine is a totalitarian regime". Claims about employment and education are taken at face value. Him giving $10 to a right-wing Queens County group takes up as much space as his multiple civil judgements.

How is it that you can lie THIS much and get elected? Do we not have rules in place for getting on ballots? Do you not have to present a resume like a job, considering this IS a job, one of the highest in the nation? It should have a ton of scrutiny. If you say you were employed at a place, it should be verified. Same with school. Military. Charity. Anything and everything. You posted to some r/furry thread - better believe we as voters should know it!

The Russian Orthodox church has been working on fostering relations with Evangelical churches since the 80s. Anyone studying Russian corruption and the link with the GOP takes a good look at the religious link. They get along on a lot of points like bigotry.

This is a huge thing in "New Life", "Vinyard", and various other Pentacostal offshoots. Funny thing is; every single one of these churches I'm familiar with, has a recent (last 10 year) scandal of youth pastors fucking kids, or worship leaders fucking parishoners (male and female).

Lindsey just said the other day, "We can't have Trump policies without Trump". He is their boy for 2024 and very much the leader. Don't forget about the Mara Magoo trips that McCarthy took over the last 2 years either. That orange idiot still very much pulls the GOP strings.

I wanna know why no one seems to be asking why? What was the motive ? How did they know police were coming ? What possesses 3 people to commit such an act? Australia is no America this kind of doesn’t happen here.

I agree with you there .... but what we don't really know is that all three people were actively the police killers. Equally possible that only one person was a nut case and had the other two hostage ... and I am pretty sure we will never know.
$500 over four years is gentle compared to mine. I live in a rural area, and signed a lease for my apartment in November 2021 for $1100/month. In November 2022, when they were renewing leases they wanted $1500/month for the next year. Meanwhile my job gave us 2.3% cost of living raise to balance inflation lol. This apartment offered no amenitys other then some ran down basketball hoops. I said fuck that and found somewhere cheaper.
It’s frustrating when they’re buying up GPUs or Taylor Swift tickets, but at least in those situations I don’t need them in order to survive.

Yeah, right to buy really backfired when 40% of those bought have been rented out privately. Like, sure, get the benefit then rip of other people that could have really used the help you got.

It's a worldwide thing too - the increases some of my friends in Canada / us have seen is insane. (admittedly in Canada its not a high percentage increase, it was just stupid high to begin with).

Putin remembers all too well the consequences of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, which demonstrated that the Soviet machine was not invincible even when trying to subjugate a country next to then. Within years, the Soviet Union fell. Granted, there were other factors, but the Russian people do not reward the leaders who fail them.

What is likely to happen is that Russian losses will become so bad and embarrassing that Putin will find a scapegoat and declare it was some other thing that caused them to fail. Traitors, incompetent generals, western spies.

I believe at the very end, even if Russia uses nuclear weapons, they will have to admit having weak, incompetent and corrupt government and military. In that case, they will be occupied by some power to ensure they behave.

Or Putin can continue the war which has only had the effect of strenhening NATO, bolstering US power on the world stage, and evaporating their already meager operational military. To say nothing about achieving zero military goals in Ukraine after nearly a year.

I know Japan is ruled by people who should've retired decades ago - hence most of its problems - but in his case it's especially ridiculous he has any sort of influence still.

"De Facto" literally means not in accordance to law, but effectively the same. Nearly every single NATO member is providing military assistance to Ukraine. The effective difference between the aid they are retrieving and full NATO membership could be debatable since NATO doesn't require member nations to send ground forces or control airspace or even declare war with the invading nation.
If article 5 is invoked all of the members of NATO will come to the attacked country’s defense with such action that they deem necessary. That have to contribute in one way or another but they are not all required to or expected to fully mobilize their militaries and send them to war because there are NATO members whose militaries are irrelevant. Like… if NATO went to war with Russia a country like Croatia really has nothing meaningful to contribute militarily so they would find other ways to contribute.

If somehow the U.S. congress and president justified to themselves that 'thoughts and prayers' were deemed 'necessary', then maybe. Article 5 does say that member nations should act in sufficient capacity as if they were themselves attacked.

In a capacity as if my own country were attacked would mean boots on the ground and planes in the sky. I can't imagine it would be much different for any nation.

Nothing other than undermining the entire alliance and making the sitting leadership look weak or pro-Russian. NATO membership is a stepping stone to hosting troops in an allied nation though, which would mean that an aggressive nation would have to attack NATO troops in order to invade them. Which would almost certainly bring the US into a war. US troops are deployed in the Baltic States, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania so Russia can't attack those countries without attacking the US.

I think the real military actions in case of an article 5 would be far more robust in reality than what is currently being done for Ukraine. However, in a situation where all the members of NATO wanted to avoid direct confrontation but still abide by the terms, the situation in Ukraine would be comparable.

Ukraine is not an anything member of NATO and the fact that the Russian soldiers in Ukraine are still alive makes that obvious. Your application for NATO was rejected years ago, we are being nice and helping but don’t confuse this for something that it’s not. Not being a dick but we’re not friends with Ukraine we just really don’t like Russia.
Imagine thinking that Iran could mount any type of significant defense against the United States _because they have drones_. The occupation of Iraq was an effort to nation build for two decades. As a military effort, the Iraq War concluded within days. While Iran could likely fend off an invasion for a little longer, it’d be mostly a cake walk for our military. Don’t get us confused with Russia.
Edit: alright I get it. They do have the means to kill 15,000 people - it doesn’t have to be done humanely like I naively believed they would want to do this. However it still sounds a bit like a desperate measure to me.

They’re not gonna execute 15,000 people. They simply don’t have the means to do so, nor would the population and other countries just tolerate it. They’re using this as a justification to mass execute the more vocal protesters/leaders and to let other protesters know that they could be next if they don’t step back.

These are desperate measures though and desperation usually equals weakness, and I hope protesters understand how close to victory they really might be.
So Japan, Australia and USA included India in Quad to oppose China. India needed that badly, they needed some soft power, but now they're back tracking and siding with Russia and in turn China? China will fuck India up, no matter how much they coddle to it. With Russia's economy in dire straits, it's not a country to side with. How incompetent your foreign policy can be?
And how exactly is India colluding with China? Like, I must know how hoops your mind jumped through while reading that article, to come to such a conclusion.

Increasing trade with Russia is more to the Chinese detriment. If China were to be the supermajority consumer of Russian resources, then there is no doubt that by that point, Russia would have forgone every bit of its economic autonomy.

Only Indian nationalistic dumbasses think Russia will any longer come to the aid of India in a Sino-Indian conflict. And only western simpleminded blabbermouths would be sure that Russia would ever give up its strategic relations with both countries to try and intervene militarily. Also, both India and China have made it clear that what happens between them, remains between them. At best they'll try to slink in diplomatic support, but nothing more.

We destroy the Iranian military industrial complex, and dox the IRGC, revealing their names, addresses etc to the protesters.
We're not doing that because there's likely going to be an all-at-once style attack coming this winter, by Ukraine on the occupied territories, and by allies on Iran and it's military support of Ruzzia. Overwhelm their ability to support each other by pressing both at the same time.

Right now, we're waiting for the right moment to strike. We need to hit like 10 birds with one stone. But the time is coming pretty soon. We all know Europe won't be able to endure the 2023-2024 winter without access to gas and oil, so we're going to need to end this before then.

If Ukraine doesn't win, Ruzzia and China will control the semiconductor supply chain. Not only that, but we've given Ruzzia enough time to divert much of it's fossil fuel sales to other countries, allowing it to prop itself up while cutting off Western supplies. If we lose Ukraine, the entire global power balance will collapse.

The semiconductor supply chain is what will shift the power balance if Ukraine loses. From what I can find, Ukraine is about 50% of the worlds supply of neon as of 2022.

Yes, they're selling it at a discount right now, but it clearly is enough for them to get by on for now, and their sales are ramping up with all of the new deals they've been making with other countries. They're already negotiating to turn Turkey into their new gas hub.

Europe was filling their reserves this year while still connected to pipelines and getting supplemental LNG. And LNG terminals take a while to bring online, especially on that kind of scale, not a single year. This is a continental level we're talking about, not just national. There will need to be a massive amount of infrastructure created to convert all of Europe to survive off of LNG shipments.

Neon gas is a critical input for the semiconductor industry due to its use in lasers. One of the largest sources of neon is the steel industry, where it is a byproduct of liquid oxygen generation. As of 2022, Ukraine supplies an estimated 50 percent of neon worldwide, which is largely attributable to the legacy of the Soviet steel industry. The U.S. semiconductor industry is dependent on this portion of the global value chain, as Ukraine produces nearly all of the ultra-high-purity semiconductor-grade neon imported by the United States. This executive briefing explains neon capture, its chief downstream application (i.e., lasers), and Ukraine’s importance in the neon supply chain.".

That's why both of these issues have been popping off at the same time. It's a big powerplay by both Ruzzia and China.

If Ruzzia and China controlled both, it would severely impact the global power balance. But right now, just losing Ukraine to Ruzzia will have about the same effect due to also losing access to their petroleum and gas for Europe, who likely will not be able to endure the 2023-2024 winter due to being cut off.

Ukraine is one of the worlds largest suppliers of neon used in chip and semiconductor manufacturing. Taiwan is one of (if not the) worlds largest suppliers of said manufacturing. Both of them are Western allies.

You spend your entire life sheltered and hidden away, your family life has got to be absolutely fucked, and then one day you inherit leadership of the most fucked up country on the planet. What are you supposed to do? Enacting any sort of change might get you assassinated by your generals/ family/ elite class. You can’t just leave, again you’d probably be assassinated and you also don’t have any wealth beyond the country. Diplomatically who do you reach out to? Your country has spent the last half century being the boogeyman & laughing stock of the world and your options for world super powers & regional powers are Russia and China 2 shitty authoritarian governments, America who you have legitimate historical beef with for flattening every building in your country back in the 50s, Japan who has never admitted fault for WW2, and South Korea which really does not want to deal with your shit. Even if you could throw up your hands and say fuck it and hand the country over to South Korea they probably wouldn’t take it, and/or it would star a war with China.

He wants to go back to the Cold War when Russia was treated as a superpower instead of the regional power it nowadays is. And it will never happen, since Russia both lost its European vassals (including its sphere of influence due to them joining NATO) as well as China’s rise to power.

The only reason I brought China and their economic model up was, Russia had TRILLIONS of easily accessible wealth to invest, an education system, roads, bridges, industrial capacity, even a g-d SPACE program. China had to transition from oxen labor to computer chip manufacturing. Russia’s place in the world was Putin and his crony’s choice.

Yes. You’re nitpicking. You’re also not addressing the fact Russia hasn’t had a functional government since 1993. They had to invent words like “kleptocracy” for what Putin’s regime did to that country. Rot from within brought Russia down. Putin and his cronies blaming the EU, NATO, the US, the weather on Tuesday, are just distractions.

Maybe a liberal western democracy would have worked. Maybe not. There’s no denying that with Russias wealth (before it was looted), and its resources in manpower and infrastructure, Russia had unlimited potential, if it had simply moved forward with a similar model to China’s.
I watched livecams back in 2014. Ukraine had a suprising lot of webcams. There was also livestreams by Ukrainian news stations. I watched almost all of Maidan. I watched a peaceful pro-western rally in Odesa get attacked by provocateurs. They even shot into the crowd. I watched the crowd go mad with rage and chase them to the Trades Union building, where it became apparent the provocateurs had planned for violence. They were besieged by the protesters, then they themselves livestreamed from the inside where they had gasoline and bottles prepared and started making Molotov's. A lot of Molotov's. They ended up throwing molotovs's out at the protesters and ofc, because they're always fucking stupid managed to somehow torch themselves. A lot died in the fire.

Kazakhstan does this a lot. You can get up to 17 years for suggesting to overthrow the government. A post promoting acts of terrorism will land you up to 12 years. Other stuff like instigating ethnic conflicts or if you offend someone's religious beliefs - that's up to 7 years. Publicly criticising government officials is up to 5 years. Offending, slandering, calling names... up to 2 years...
Capitalism is inherently flawed. Regulatory capture, for-profit lobbying and geographic barriers ensure that perfect competition cannot and never will be a thing. The market does not tend naturally to perfect competition; instead it tends naturally to monopoly and price-fixing which means that any capitalist system requires constant vigilance and correction - and gives a huge incentive for companies to engage in regulatory capture.
In that case, Exxon generally didn't burn the petroleum products it extracted; it sold the vast majority of them to other entities, who actually burned them and actually generated the emissions while they were in possession of them. (Cracking does produce significant emissions, but nowhere near as much as when everything that was cracked is combusted.) Those entities, Exxon's customers, had the option not to burn what they purchased. Is it better to blame Exxon for those emissions simply because Exxon is a more conveniently identified target? Or do you really believe that it matters who took the objectionable action - as you have stated?
It's actually a grill - I was there in 2008; the place was uh, in need of maintenance, and the construction was cheap, with nice materials being used in the places that are most visible, but the rest is 3rd rate at best. BTW, I paid $60 for 2 turkey sandwiches (on plain white bread), 2 bags of potato chips, 2 cups of Coke, and 2 cups of a single scoop of ice cream each - and it was all so horrible we threw it away. The turkey was old and already bad (like, you'd be on the toilet all night long if you are it), the chips were old and stale (even the oil on them was rancid), the Coke was completely flat (very little carbonation), and the ice cream was old and freezer- burned (it tasted like a dirty freezer). I wanted to bring it all back for a refund, but the person I was with thought it would make a scene, so we left and got lunch at a diner nearby. It was perfectly clear to us then that Trump was a big bullshitter and grifter; we were pretty angry about the building and experience itself as it turned out to be a complete waste of time and money.

That has been like this for years and has happened quite a few times. Also, Demos are not forbidden because of political reasons (a judge would be removed from office immediately), but because it's a hazard that can't be controlled ,the police has not enough people or other reasons like that...

While blocking highways is not as bad as murder or terrorism, it’s still considered a major offense in most countries. But I’m sure that in this case the circumstances will be taken into account and these people won’t face any serious punishment.

The Iranian protesters are armed especially in areas where there's a large population of Kurds, there's videos of guns battles happening between the protesters and goverment forces. Guns are flowing from Kurdish factions outside of Iran, I'd also wager other Middle Eastern powers will supply arms to the protesters. Russias armed forces is way too busy in Ukraine and their State police forces are way too busy suppressing their own people to really effectively help Iran out.

This Iranian-Russian alliance is a thing we are going to hear a lot more in the future. Russia is not going to attack any western nation. Russia does not have a capability to that. We will see more Russian activity in the Middle East.

I fear this could be 1 step closer towards to civil war in Iran. Depending on how brutal the Russian (a.k.a. foreign) security forces are, revolts and with that brutality could increase to the point Iranian Army could be forced by its people to intervene, which would threaten the regime and start a war between the army and protestors vs IRG.

The info I found says that sore loser laws are mainly for congressional candidates, not presidential elections. Only South Dakota and Texas apply it to presidential candidates.

Man... can you imagine if DeSantis creamed Trump in the primary and in a fit of rage, Trump ran a third party spoiler campaign? You know that would be just like him. It would be such a beautiful trainwreck.

yeah, I was just reading up on it. Apparently the accepted term is "sore loser laws" and most states have some flavor of them at this point with variations. With that in mind, he might have to settle for trying to tear down the winning candidate as much as possible. He's got enough die hards remaining to cause a bit of a GOP civil war. Though I will say that these last few months, and especially after the midterms, I find myself wondering if his influence is just going to continue to evaporate. This poll certainly adds weight to that side of the scale.

People on the right always think this, but publicly traded corporations don't have any kind of politics or morals, they just exist to make money and will proceed in whichever manner best achieves that. This is because those companies have boards that answer to the shareholders, so if whatever decisions the CEO and board make cause the share price to go down, they'll get fired and replaced with people who will make the prices go back up.

and I've done more for Hospitals, probably even more for Elevators, than even Thomas Edison, he came up with the Light Bulb, not a lot of people know that, and we're talking the good kind, not like what they have now. we had it so much better under Trump, but now Sleepy Joe is heading us into Major Disaster. it's very sad for our Country.

In short, it's not corporations that are progressive, it's the public that is. I guess right wingers find it easier to just blame corporations because admitting the obvious truth would be rather than that corporations are.

Again, these are just financial decisions being made by corporations, nothing more. Even if it's just a vocal minority, they're apparently very effective at organizing boycotts. These companies wouldn't cave to making diversity based decisions unless it was proving to be financially harmful to not do so.

Corporations make decisions about moderating certain kinds of content, or producing certain kinds of content, or even just vaguely supporting certain positions, because they get pressured by consumers. Companies that rely on advertising get pressured by their advertisers, who get pressured by their consumers. Boycotts and pressure campaigns have real world impacts, and shape the political direction that companies go in, not because of any political position of the people on those boards, but because of profits.

So when a company like Disney says they oppose Florida's Don't Say Gay law, it's not because they actually care, it's because their consumers are pressuring them into saying that. Same for when they make the decision to cast a Black woman as The Little Mermaid. Right wingers see these things and think Disney is too "woke", but they're just reacting to the general public. Disney used to make incredibly racist stuff when that's what the public wanted.

Twitter, by contrast, is not a publicly traded company, but rather is owned by one person who doesn't answer to anyone, so he can do whatever he wants with it. It may end up costing him billions of dollars personally to run it the way he is, as advertisers flee under pressure from the general public, but nobody can fire him for costing the company all that money cause it's his money.

If the vast majority of people were opposed to diversity, then companies would get far more financial pressure to avoid it. I don't know what to tell you, this is free market capitalism in action. There's a reason all these conservative alternatives to these companies and services are not anywhere near as successful (if they're successful at all). It's because that is what most people are opposed to.

He’s the one who said Twitter needs to be politically neutral for it to be trusted, not us. Since he bought it he’s made it more political than ever. The point is he’s a virtue signaling hypocrite.

I say we send Elon to Mars right now. Let's not bother with providing him any kind of living supplies or conditions on his flight there, or with figuring out how to safely land the rocket once it gets there. Just pack him in an interplanetary missle and shoot it directly at Mars.

IMO: Yes Presidents should still have the power to unilaterally act during a crisis... the democratic process is often too slow and fraught with endless debates, arguing, and gerrymandering (edit: Filibusters) to get things done when they need to get done NOW.

Suspending evictions of people who were forced out of jobs due to covid, for example, was absolutely a good thing. Suspennding debt repayment because the workplace was massively effected was a good thing. Completely forgiving the debt was debatable, and certainly declaring an emergency to build a wall that was never going to work was out of bounds.

Using emergencies as a 'Tactic', should have some kind of oversight, but not to the degree of preventing its use when it's needed. I do like the idea of auto-expiring periods where extensions need to be confirmed.

Bad economies and high inflation are great opportunities for populist leaders and right wing extremists because they tap into all the fear and resentment and channel it towards scapegoats and imagined enemies. Basically the masses are particularly susceptible to megalomaniacs and dictators the worse conditions get.

My dog has a favorite rock. When we lived in California half our back yard was rocks, and she kept bringing this one into the house to suck on. We'd toss it outside among the hundreds of similar rocks but she would somehow always find the same one.

It’s just an algorithm that synthesizes an argument in response to a prompt. It’s hardly SkyNet. I’m more concerned about people using these machine learning programs to make arguments their behalf rather than invent their own arguments. That, and jobs being siphoned off by algorithms and leaving otherwise employable people high and dry.

It's not even a hassle to get consent. Just stop if your partner says no, if they are unconscious or heavily inebriated (inb4 some incel tries to nitpick what constitutes "heavily inebriated", it's pretty obvious when a sloppy drunk chick is just drunk-horny and will not be happy if she wakes up and realizes what you did), if they seem uncomfortable or otherwise hesitant, or (and this is the real game changer) if she even seems like she was reluctant but gives in to your incessant pestering. IOW, if you had to pester her for sex, that's problematic. In order to acquire positive consent, I just make sure none of the above (and some other) criteria are met, and then I let her pull my stuff out and do with it what she wants (that I consent to). Pretty good sign of consent when your partner is the one initiating intercourse.

There is no more low season for tourism, and even early December was packed with people on the streets. This is a classic example of when so many things have gone wrong and the government has not managed things well. But sadly, a big part of it is the actual nature of the tourists that are coming to enjoy things with a giant rental cara thinking they will drive around Bairro Alto.

There are no easy answers and a lot of change needs to come within but I also think that a lot of the people who so arrogantly talk about how cheap it is have no idea of the recent history of the country and have no idea what happened in 1974 in the impact on today.

the digital nomad sub I was told that my 78 year old mother in law simply planned poorly because she doesn't own a house in Lisbon, unlike the poster whose mother owns 3 houses in California. Because he's a privileged American, he just expects everybody to be on the same level, which is, of course, absurd.

I mean the inspectors have said the school doesn’t meet the standards of an independent school for like 4 years running now and it’s still there .

The fact that after decades of senseless violence many Israelis lost all hope for peace is not the same as systemic education coming from our schools, teaching us that giving up our lives to kill a few children is the right thing to do.

The ISI normally inspect private schools, this is a small private ("independent") school. Either Ofsted or the ISI inspect these places, and the DfE is in charge of both organisations, and yes - all three entities can and will shut them down in an instant if they can prove this.

This is literally illegal, there is a specific set of rules against extremism in schools, especially religious and international schools - and quite a problem with "smaller" independent schools, which are basically corporate organisations and churches claiming to "teach" kids but which can open up and get shut down faster than the authorities can keep up.
Wrong all around. The Emancipation Proclamation freed only slaves in territory held by the Confederacy. Slaves held in areas under control of the US government were not freed by the Proclamation. Since it only applied to slaves in areas held by the Confederacy, it wasn't really enforceable and to some degree it was more symbolic. But it was a very important symbol. By issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln had essentially declared war on slavery, cementing it as a central issue of the war. While this was important from a moral standpoint, it was also a critical strategic move. The South had been trying to get European powers like Britain and France to support them. By issuing the EP, Lincoln ensured that Britain and France would not be able to declare support the Confederacy without declaring support for slavery.
Unless they're trying to push their "Republicans freed the slaves and Democrats founded the Klan" rhetoric, then it was a good thing.

The problem is the Fed and rest of the government isn’t able or won’t address the problem. When everything goes way up in price for company profits, you can’t realistically cut back enough for the economy to slow down. Starvation isn’t really an option. Being unable to go to work is t really an option. Having clothes isn’t always an option. This results on some amount of the economy continuing to move, even if other stuff slows. And the Fed will just keep trying to make people unemployed because it’s all they know. Congress won’t address the corporate greed. So you end up here. Where the economy looks okay-ish on paper, but is really hanging by a thread. Unregulated capitalism fucking sucks.

This time he’s telling us his evil plan and we should know to believe him. Sure we all knew the wall and payment from Mexico was also fodder for his base. This gender issue has momentum with his base and Republican politicians who are all obsessed with children’s genitals. There is something like 1% or less of the population that consider themselves trans or something. No teachers or doctors are pushing this on kids. Trump and his ilk know it but they can use unreasonable hatred to get themselves ahead.

I would love if my country/region/local government would get on board with helping. The examples I have seen fail to meet additionality criteria. I am pretty sure I would be pro-offset, pro-emission reduction, and if it can work: pro-sequestration/capture/removal. But what I believe the UN is trying to move folks away from are essentially greenwashing campaigns.
Sharm el Sheikh (Egypt) (AFP) – The UN's chief called Tuesday for an end to a "toxic cover-up" by companies as a sweeping report said they cannot claim to be net zero if they invest in new fossil fuels, cause deforestation or offset emissions instead of reducing them.

"It's very easy to make an announcement that you are going to be net zero by 2050. But you have to walk the talk and what we've seen is that there is not enough action," said Catherine McKenna, Canada's former environment and climate change minister, who led the panel.

There have been growing concerns that some firms have not aligned their efforts with the latest climate science -- by failing to account for emissions from key activities, or by saying they can make up for increasing pollution today with "carbon credits" from activities like tree planting.

The report recommends that credits should not be used to "offset" emissions, until after a firm has done everything possible to cut emissions in line with the 1.5C target and that if they are used at all they should be from a reliable and verified source.

In September, an analysis by CDP, a non-profit that runs a global disclosure system for companies to manage their environmental impacts, found that the decarbonisation plans of major corporations from G7 nations put Earth on course to heat a potentially catastrophic 2.7C.

Haley may be running for the national exposure as part of her long term career strategy. Or maybe she thinks she can maneuver into a VP slot. She might even have cut a deal with Trump to run as a spoiler vs DeSantis.

It sucks that they indoctrinate their children from nearly birth with hatred (this is a fact - Google examples such as what’s in their textbooks if you don’t believe me // Bourdain also highlighted it when he visited). It definitely makes it hard to have peace when you have a very angry, young, and ignorant crowd.

A lot of faculty are edge-lords. I went to Yale and the majority of the professors I knew there had serious personality flaws. You don’t get hired at a place like that because you’re a well rounded person, you get there because you’ve poured your entire life into a single academic area and the politics that come with it. The result is that most of these people are adult children with massively underdeveloped social skills and empathy.

The vast majority of people I went to school with were good people and are doing good things now. You get shitty people from anywhere and they all find ways to succeed. Just because someone went to an Ivy doesn’t make them bad and just because someone went to a state school doesn’t make them good. Wall Street pulls from everywhere and they are equally bad.

While I agree the world needs to rebalance after Covid, I have yet to see some hard and factual numbers that show we are either in a recession or headed there. But there is no guarantee. I just wish the media would shut up about the "talking heads" that have no economic backgrounds who keep yelling recession. If you say something enough, people will believe it and start acting that way. Just look at the Jam6 big lie to see how many Americans bought that rubbish and lies.

Idaho, Iowa, Missouri have bills to criminalize librarianship for providing books that offer views of equality. Idaho's bill failed in the state Senate. Even in places like New Jersey and New York, libarians have been attacked by right-wing extremists. Trump and the Republican party unleashed this and DOJ is not doing much to stop it. As a retired librarian, I have seen attempts at censorship before in my career, but nothing like this. This is organized hate.

it's all gentrifying everywhere in Colorado now though, even the rough around the edges kinda shitty towns are seeing a lot of growth and development. A lot more people moving to Colorado in general and a lot of this people would rather just live near the mountains anyway as they get priced out of the front range and mountain towns.

I spent 8 days in her district (vacation) and I don't get it either. The entire district seemed to be full of intelligent, hard working, surprisingly liberal minded (aside from guns) people. The only thing I can think of is the district is full of single issue voters.
Considering their atrocious record of facilitating Nazi theft from Jewish businesses and families, then keeping the ill-gotten goods themselves, no surprise here.
So basically, the article says that they’re still looking to do so and rather, just in a way that’s legal and they want to make sure that the global relations they make with other nations is consistent… and people are mad about this? Did y’all even read the article? It’s easy to get up in arms because you personally feel a certain way about the war(most of us do), but really, Switzerland is taking the exact same and safe approach to this that virtually any other country would in their position. There are standards, laws, and regulations that have to be adhered to. If you really think that international politics is as simple as “you broke you pay”, you’re dense.

The hate here is unjustified. Most people didn’t even read the article, and honestly the article wasn’t worth posting to begin with because this is just the same standard process virtually any nation is going to take. There’s nothing particularly notable here. They were just looking to use Russia/Ukraine for clicks.

And before some dumbass thinks I’m in support of Russia, no. But holy shit the comments here genuinely hurt my skull. How hard is it to understand that global politics usually aren’t gonna be one and done, regardless of how simple the situation might be perceived to be? I’m sure wartime/global politics is pretty easy to pick up given how many redditors here who are “experts” lmfao. Just because they didn’t reach an immediate conclusion doesn’t mean they won’t reach one.

It's nowhere near as bad. If they're from his time as vice president, the National Archives obviously didn't know they were even missing and he wasn't trying to prevent their return. Trump basically ignored the NA informing him they were missing documents and asked form then to be returned and Trump basically refused to cooperate to the point his home was raided. Biden has been fully cooperating and he/his staff had previously found documents and returned them on their own.

And if you cooperate with the authorities, after breaking the law the crime instantly disappears. Reddit said so.

Documents hes said he wasnt aware he had, and is working with the DOJ to ensure that any more are found and turn in.

Likely human error as, from reports that I've read, it's a small number of rocuments like less than 30 from many different larger files. Trump had numerous files and hundreds of thousands of documents.

So unless youve got a source that shows otherwise happened with Biden, youve got speculation that holds about as much weight as the idea that Trumps telepathically declassified, personally owned, but planted by the FBI documents are 100% legal.

Big difference here is that Biden was likely entirely unaware, as was the National Archives, that any documents were missing. Both Trump and the NA knew Trump was in possession of documents.

Lets draw a bit of a comparison here. 2 people speed down the road, 2 people get lit up by the cops.
There's no solution to climate change under capitalism. That's their problem. Corporations need to make increased profit each year to satisfy their obligations to their shareholders, so long term investments into things that aren't a source of constant profit just isn't viable. Renewable energy is for the most part better for the general public, but not great for making money.
that, and my understanding is that a lot of developing countries were planning on trying to get an agenda item talking about what are essentially climate reparations. like "you rich fucks have been polluting for so long and now my beachfront is 10 miles inland, how about you pay for some of this damage".

If it were that simple to rebalance wealth, stop squabbles over land and resources, settle "who's god is right" and simply do the right fucking thing for our children then I'll throw all my stuff on the pile too.

I mean I can’t afford a house. I probably can barely afford to heat my rental basement suite. I have already cut back my meat consumption about 75% 90% now is chicken while the other 10 is locally sourced from a small scale ranch I have connection to. I work from home, I cook my own food, don’t consume much processed food, recycle, compost etc.

You’re doing your part, but you’re right, it’s really just virtue signalling. It gives me a sense of control however so I’ll just keep signaling and voting with my values until the people who can make a difference decide it matters to them too.

Dude should have been investigated on receiving over $100,000 a year and still running a "non-profit" that was funded by groups pushing for charter schools and school vouchers so private companies could make money off schools all while STILL BEING superintendent.

A family friend of ours, who works with my wife in the local school system here in Ohio, is moving to North Carolina due to husband’s job. She is a phenomenal gifted teacher but is leaving the profession for now because it’s a disaster where they are moving to and her salary would take a massive hit.

Oklahoma education is dying, and Ryan Walters is trying to burn it to the ground. Oklahoma is dead last in education attainment, and they want to keep going lower. Republicans have all but killed education in this state.
Especially since you can presumably get at least one by doing that thing that nobody expects where you kill someone in cold blood. You know, shooting them from behind because there’s no real reason to suspect anyone is going to just shoot you on the street apropos of nothing.

I think you missed the point of my comment and thus gave your bad faith disingenuous reply. It's very common for people to express one opinion out of virtue while believing in the opposite on some level which slips out from time to time, either explicitly or via mannerisms.

If your stance is that people who claim "virtuous opinions" are 100% genuine in those opinions, that is extremely naive and I wouldn't bank on that. For example, nearly everyone you run into now claims "being gay is ok and acceptable". How much do people get mocked for just exhibiting gay tendencies? Not even fucking close to zero.

Yeah just having a CCW, even if you don’t exercise the right, immediately lowers your chances of ever committing a violent crime. It’s a tragedy that having a CCW will also get you suspicious looks from family, friends, employers, and certain LEO departments when you’ve made yourself a statistically safer person to be around even if you don’t carry the weapon at all.

The amount of hoops you have to go through in some states for it is exactly the amount of hoops that should be required to get your first firearm in the first place. Any additional firearm should be as easy to buy as it currently is, but not your first. If you don’t have the patience to turn in all the documentation and renew it periodically, then you shouldn’t be allowed to own a firearm at all. Of course, this is assuming SCOTUS and 3 letter agencies successfully force the states to actually process those applications in a timely manner and make the processes (including training) free, otherwise it’s just a 2A violation waiting to be struck down.
All of the political establishment press lackies and their propaganda articles has failed to change this course since 2015 and will continue to fail.

You see, as soon as they have enough fissile material it becomes quite easy (for a State, mind you) to make a bomb. Also, bombs are relatively small, so easy to hide. A military nuclear program can only be stopped by military means if it is in the production of fissile material stage, as the Israelis did before with Iraq and Syria. After that it is fait acompli.
If you have enough enriched Uranium or Plutonium making a bomb is very easy. For an individual even.

It is easy to create an inefficient bomb that fizzes a bit and makes a lot of mess. There is a lot more complexity to creating an efficient bomb that has a decent yield (neutron reflectors, etc).

It's basically 1/2 the fuel in a bowl shape, 1/2 in a sphere to fit the bowl and slam them together hard. 15-20m of gravity is enough energy.

What he said is correct, but it wouldn't be a very impressive explosion. The reason nuclear weapons are complex is that getting decent yields is somewhat difficult (and pretty much all classified). Plutonium is bloody hard to machine as well.

There was a guy in Tennessee last week who stalked a girl and then filmed himself going to the police and complaining that it didn't work. He sounded word-for-word like a fucking parody from the pre-Trump era, but he ended up being deadass serious and got himself arrested.

Been this way forever, and it was worse before, Supervisors working more than 40hrs a week got "paid" at the rate for a GS-10 step 10 OR could take "compensatory time off" - 1 hr of comp time for each hour worked. Also, the total annual pay could not exceed the base pay for a freshman Congressman. so if you were a non-supervisory GS-12 or above deployed with the troops for Desert Storm and worked 70-hr weeks, when you got home, you could owe back thousands of dollars because with overtime, your WEEKLY pay worked out to more than said freshman congressman's weekly pay. That is, you didn't exceed the ANNUAL pay for the Congresscritter, but you busted the "cap" on a weekly basis. One of my guys got slammed for $12,000 because he risked his life for his country, but Republicans were in charge of the administration, and didn't think that was worth an exception to the rule.

In principle you're not wrong, except one massive issue with the LastPass breach is the passwords weren't guaranteed to be hashed with a sufficient number of iterations. The standard minimum these days is 100,000 iterations but if you had an old account (merely more than a couple years) then your master password might only have 5000 hashes which is readily attackable especially if it wasn't super complex (but even somewhat attack even if it was complex). The fact that they didn't update the iterations automatically over time but just left it at the "factory' setting in your profile was an absolute miscarriage of security.

I like cloud password services (especially when combined with 2FA/TOTP), but you expect services like LastPass to always follow best practices and they made some serious mistakes.

What does it matter if the passwords are salted using a master password? The only thing they get is a useless hash. No idea why all these comments are raving about how password managers are bad. They are perfectly fine so long as you have a long, powerful master password as is required for using things like LastPass.

It's not like your usual login where password recovery simply means replacing your hashed password with a new hashed password. Replacing the hashed master password is useless if the old password wasn't used to decrypt the vault first.

Though, quantum computers for example will be able to crack open all of these vaults. Which is dizzyingly concerning, but password storage software will be updated long before it's a reality, and migrating the vault to a more secured encryption algorithm won't be any different than changing the master password by the user.

Homeless problem was out of control since at least 2013. Covid has NOTHING to do with this. It’s been 10 years with “your” policies you apparently support. The problem has not been improved in any measurable metric.

Well, the US federal government did manage to keep the wheels from completely falling off while a functionally illiterate, highly-compromised conman was president for four years. We’re finding more and more issues (like the speaker silliness) where the rules were created with the idea that people would act in good faith, and would actually want a functioning democracy. Hopefully the US can keep its head above water while the grown ups adjust some things to account for the moral plague of the modern GOP. In the interim, probably unfair to compare things to a country with less than half the population of California.

The House Jan 6 Committee meets today at 1pm ET for it's final public session. Committee members will present closing arguments on their investigation into the Capitol attack, formally adopt their final report, and vote on both civil and criminal referrals in connect to Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election.
Trump himself is expected to face criminal referrals, reportedly for conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, and insurrection. Referrals are also expected for other Trump allies, including Republican lawmakers who refused to comply with Congressional subpoenas. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson has suggested referrals for ethics violations, legal misconduct and campaign finance violations may also be issued. However, the Committee's referrals are non-binding and it will be up to federal prosecutors to bring charges.

If they were against ESGs they would not take money from private equity that uses ESGs. The fact that they publicly denounce this, but still take money from these private equity firms is an example of not having an ideology . They will do anything that helps them in the moment regardless if it conflicts with previous statements, behavior, or beliefs.
All he has to do with the Jan 6th prosecution is relax. The DOJ took over 2 years to do anything. A special counsel takes another couple of years on average, which given the number of charges, the huge amount of phone data and testimony sounds about right. Then if they decide to indict it's another year to come to trial. The trial itself will take months and Trump's lawyers will delay at every turn. Then of course he will appeal and appeal and appeal. So he hasn't got much to worry about because he will probably be dead by the time it comes to anything.

Fun story: last time my wife and I got yelly with her parents was over student loan forgiveness. My wife compared it to PPP loans (which, FIL's organization got one). FIL said no that's different because the PPP loans were never intended to be paid back, to which I said oh so they were handouts. He loved that one oh boy.

However, congresspeople should still be banned from controlling their own investments as they do get exposed to a lot of info. And, the fact that no one has been charged under he current insider trading rules just shows the current regime isn't working.
Ehh honestly this won’t be a popular opinion but largely with roads and schools I think the biggest issue isn’t funding, it’s refusal to fire bad employees. Throughout my schooling we had some absolutely amazing teachers, and some teachers that couldn’t teach a damn thing. We had teachers that were clearly checking out underage students, flirting, and grooming and nothing was ever done about it, and I only heard of one teacher getting fired. What did she do? Come in on drugs for years, talk about her abuse at the hands of her bf with middle schoolers (get the help you need but for the love of god don’t tell children), and what actually got her fired was they found out her teaching degree was fake, and she didn’t know Spanish very well after teaching Spanish for years.
The problem with that line of argument is that those same conservatives that point to those problems as why we shouldn’t help Ukraine, will then turn around and vote against doing anything to address any of those problems.

Very small amount of conservatives like Putin, most just don’t think Ukraine is our problem or responsibility to deal with. We have a failing school system, crumbling roads and other forms of infrastructure, and enough problems here that a. Lot of conservatives don’t think we should waste money on other countries.
The vice presidents schedule would always be marked as “classified” as you don’t want everyone knowing your every move for safety reasons. Their schedule may even be marked as “top secret” if they have a meeting, phone call, or unannounced visit with a foreign leader. These classification marking don’t just go away after the fact and the people conducting these searches don’t have a reason to read the contents. They see “classified” and hand them over to the people that need to know. Nearly any “classified” document is benign as they hand them out to 18 year olds like candy.

On one hand, many women are forced into it by a repressive society/governments, and it often feels like a symbol of that repression. There are, however, some who do feel like it is part of their culture. So to utilize it as a political stunt like that would be fairly insensitive to those who, for whatever reason they have, opt to wear it and don't feel oppressed in doing so.

I despise anyone being forced to conform like that, but I obviously would not judge someone who chose to wear it when they were not forced to do so through law or threat of violence.

I’m registered as a Republican, because we have closed primaries and Republicans win 90% of the elections here, so it’s the only way to have influence over which R eventually makes it to the general election.

Yep, in MA the term we use is "unenrolled" and you can vote in either. The only thing registering with a political party actually does is restrict you to only being eligible for the primary of the party you're registered with, so registering with a political party is pretty much just a public statement of your values.

So ideologically I'm not aligned with either party so traditionally I have no affiliation. However, I live in Florida which has closed primaries meaning I can only vote in my party's primary. My status prevented me from voting in those elections. I recently changed my registration to remedy that and therein lies the answer to your question.

Someone needs to explain it to Trump this way: At the end of the day, he was an nothing more than a high level employee for the government, not the owner. When you are fired from your job, all documents pertaining to the job and it's trade secrets belong to your boss. He has/had zero authority. He can keep saying he does all he likes, that will never make it true.

Russia is full of lies and propaganda. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Issue is that Russia is trying to put a wedge between Poland and Ukraine by presenting Poland as land grabbing warmongering nation.

If no one ever calls him out on it, his disinformation becomes the de facto information. That's essentially how propaganda works. Since propaganda can now be easily disseminated on a global scale, it's helpful for as many countries as possible to fight back against it.

For some reason, that reminded me of China; they spread disinformation all day every day because they use trade deals as hostages so every country had to shut up, never calling them out.

What I’ve seen is “we believe in ‘innocent until proven guilty’.” So even the stuff he’s admitted he lied about, as far as the House GOP is concerned, is not a lie until he’s been convicted of it. This is how low their bar is these days. I mean, there are multiple members of their caucus under criminal investigation as we speak. That the party of law and order, the party of personal responsibility, the party of the adults in the room would pretend this is OK says a whole lot about how hollow their franchise is.
“I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...”.
It absolutely isn't, my grandfather is going on 90 and is comfortable setting up his own home security system, doing maintenance and data transfers on his laptops, and is always up to date on consumer electronics. I understand that he's an outlier, but the only thing keeping older people ignorant of how technology works is stubbornness, there's no shortage of opportunities to learn.
There’s other info on the page, you can see if you follow link. It mentions other POWs, that they’ve been fed, taken care of in a humanitarian manner. And there’s repeated info about Geneva. The Russians know that “Geneva conventions” means basically that are fed, get medical treatment, not tortured—they know because they’re told that Russia abides and Ukraine does not. The biggest hurdle is to get them to trust the unknown (Ukraine) when only have been presented picture that it’s evil. But when they’re pushed far enough (mistreated by commanders, freezing, etc), many are willing to take the gamble that maybe what they heard was untrue and surrender is a better option.
I'm always amazed and touched at the assistance being offered to Ukraine by countries that I would have assumed did not give a flying fuck about what is happening there.

Imports of Brazilian meat (i.e. exports of our meat) are one among the two biggest drivers in new deforestation, as we already have enough cattle and farmland to feed our entire population. Exported Brazilian beef reached sales of almost 10 billion USD in 2021. Soybeans are the second major culprit too, but it's basically only China that buys them at massive scale (70% of our soybean exports go to China, totaling 38 billion USD in 2021), and it's hard to spread awareness there.
Demand for Brazilian beef (and soybeans if at all possible) worldwide needs to go down. Buy beef from countries other than us.

Okay, what neutral basic algorithm? What makes it neutral? Who decides if it is, in fact, neutral? Does it use existing political boundaries? Neighborhoods and ethnic enclaves? Or only natural ones (e.g. watersheds)? I can just imagine the politicians wrangling over which algorithm is more “neutral” than which other algorithm.

No, Trump's Voter Fraud commission was disbanded but it wasn't because of evidence of Republican voter fraud. The commission just did the task it was assigned to and plainly didn't find widespread voter fraud.

- you can’t just use existing natural boundaries or county/city limit lines because you have to divide the state population evenly by the number of allocated representatives. That’s not the way natural/existing boundaries work.

- Regardless of who does the drawing, it is an intensely political act, with huge political ramifications. If it were a non-partisan technocrat, political parties would just seek to control who is appointed into that position. It doesn’t erase the problem.
I know it's cool revisionism to say that the allies fought Germany because of the genocide but the reality is - nobody gave a fuck. They fought the war, because they were declared war upon.
Even after the war was won by the allies they recruited a lot of old Nazis to their ranks or put them in positions of power inside of Germany.

There was quite a bit of denial for some time in the German population about what happened and it could easily have gone the way of Japan or other countries that deny their atrocities. But it didn't.

In fact, most countries didn’t even believe the holocaust was actually happening. During WW1, accusations of killing ethnic groups was thrown at every other nation as a propaganda tool. When reports of the Nazi regime committing genocide against the Jewish, Romani, etc, everyone just thought ‘oh it’s just wartime propaganda again.’ It wasn’t until American and Soviet forces liberated concentration camps that the truth of the situation was revealed.

Also completely fucked is the fact US and Soviet forces would make gay men and women stay behind in the camps, so the lingering Nazi’s could come and kill them while they went off attacking other bases.
-Wagenknecht has called for the dissolution of NATO and for a new security agreement that links Germany and Russia. Throughout her career, Wagenknecht has argued in favor of a closer relationship with Russia; in 1992, she penned an essay praising Stalinist Russia.
-In the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Wagenknecht was a prominent defender of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, arguing on February 20, 2022 that while the United States was trying to "conjure up" an invasion of Ukraine, "“Russia has in fact no interest to march into Ukraine.”.

Most germans would probably agree that lady is thoughly fcked in the head and might just destroy what was left of "Die Linke" (far left party) all by her lonesome. Her views are extremely niche and she personally started essentially having a mental breakdown in public. since covid started her deterioation in rational thought has become especially alarming. I can just hope for her own sake that she will retire soon. So we can stop listening to her utterly mind-rotten ideas and her party colleagues, many of which are actually still sane despite her, can take over the spotlight.
I think a lot of the people calling for direct NATO intervention (and a no-fly zone would be exactly that) underestimate the death toll and increase in risk towards nuclear war.
As horrible as this war is, and as much as we all want it to end - as long as Russia doesn't attack NATO directly and deliberatly, it would be a horrible mistake to intervene. A no-fly zone would be the brink of World War 3.

I think a lot of people have swallowed too much kool-aid and think Russia is itching to launch nukes. I do not think it a realistic possibility at all that Russia would commit suicide by going there. They have absolutely nothing to gain by doing so, and would lose absolutely everything if they did. And they know it. It's why they keep bringing it up; to scare the world into allowing their genocide of Ukraine to continue.

As it stands, Russian nukes are working much better than Nato nukes. Because their deterrent factor is allowing this whole horrific ordeal to continue. Meanwhile, Nato nukes do not seem to worry Russia in the slightest. For exactly the same reason; they know that they are not going to be used.

The only reasonable and humane solution here would be to force Russia to halt its war via full Nato intervention. Russia knows they got no chance against Nato, but as long as Nato pussyfoots around, Russia gets to destroy all the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine, leaving, eventually, 40 million people without electricity, heat or water as winter approaches. I do not find this a palatable eventuality.

Its not about wanting it, its about accidentally happening. See Able Archer, Cuba, Berlin crisis etc. In none of these cases anybody wanted to nuke each other, but they thought the other one would do it. Simulations have shown again and again that nuclear war is a possibility.

Do you expect Nato to go first-strike then? No? That leaves Russia. Will they use nukes first, fully knowing that it is a self-destruct button? No. Despite the apparent idiocy of this whole affair, Russia has not displayed characteristics of an irrational actor. They just overplayed their hand. They aren't going to burn their own house down just to spite the west.

What they are going to do, if Nato continues to allow it, is destroy the ability of Ukraine to remain warm and fed into the winter. Then, blackmail Ukraine into relinquishing the annexed territories or risk the entire civilian population perishing from "natural causes" as temperatures drop and power stations continue to be bombarded.
Do you know for sure whether those sensors would be on sanctions lists? This was something I was wondering about a while back, because I used to work in manufacturing, and without the controllers that have computer chips in them, the equipment I used to run, wouldn't even work. I had to replace them somewhat regularly. Same with the sensors.
I used to work for a company that made safety instrumentation for oil and gas, ie pressure, temperature, flow, and level sensors. Most of which are used around the world in refineries and transportation systems like pipelines and terminals. Most of these refineries are automated so having working sensors is extremely important in the safety feedback loop.

We were shown a video at work of a refinery exploding in Mexico that killed 12 or so people because they had defective sensors that didn't alert the control crew of a problem.

Also the refining process is especially volatile, using insane pressures and pretty nasty chemicals that are both caustic and explosive if they mix in or or subject to different atmospheres.

You know I'm not fan of the liberal party but I have been listening to Christopher Pyne's podcast where he interviews Australian politicians from both Labor and the liberal party sometimes I don't like his guests sometimes I do ( like he had albo as a guest who I like) anyway he had Malcolm Turnbull on & Christopher Pyne said he hadn't caught a train for like 40 years until Malcolm Turnbull made him. Malcolm Turnbull said it's important to catch the train to connect with the common people and talk with them.
So he's still like heaps out of touch, I mean who catches the train to connect with people lol. He probably has that chauffeur you are talking about but at least he tries I guess lol.

I can't imagine Poland being able to build a border fence that's tough enough to stop an army. Border walls have never really worked and they don't even stop migrants. And those migrants don't have the ability to fire rocket barrages or call in air support. Just seems like political posturing and kind of a silly idea. A couple of artillery batteries would do more to dissuade an advancing army than a border wall. They should spend their money on things that go boom, it'd probably be more cost effective.
I definitely remember an article about a guy setting up a fake border and a fake border crossing some kms from I think Finland's border on the Russian side, and collecting, uh, visa fees for crossing.

I also think that certain people/orgs within the US government knew about these much sooner than we know and the interesting part of this whole thing is not the occurrence, but what led to the decision to go public with this stuff now.

The US was almost certainly running a counter-intel operation against it. Probably not jamming per se as that might cause issues with critical infrastructure depending on what signals it was transmitting. But I think, with a reasonably high degree of certainty, that the US was trying to figure out what sort of information it was collecting and where it was sending it with SIGINT assets (both COMINT and ELINT) of our own. And there's probably a related HUMINT operation underway, too. And I have no doubt any other country in this situation would do the same.
Seems like the EU is ahead of us in attitudes toward security. I personally have had my information lost in too many data breaches to keep track in my mind, healthcare and other businesses’ insufficient security has been the root cause of all. Each offers standard 2 years of credit monitoring or Norton or similar. I’ve been given this enough times that it is almost a moot point now They overlap I’d like to see more serious consequences than 2 year’s worth of Norton per person. They probably get a discount from Norton anyway for the size of the breaches and therefore the number of “new” customers.
You know, seriously, would that make this data worthless? I feel like basically everyone's phone number and email is basically public domain now after so many breaches.

Go for it. USAJobs.gov, pretty sure there are plenty of revenue agent postings for LBI. They start at GS13, but there might be some 14s too. look up what that means in your city, then once you put in an application , if you get an interview and a tentative offer, use your current salary to negotiate for a higher step, if necessary. Applying for federal jobs is really confusing and the hiring process moves at an excruciatingly slow pace. Check out r/usajobs for guidance.

The fact that we're even reading about it means that there was an attempt but it failed or was successfully contained. Nobody would publicly announce their failure. Like people say, somethings being hacked every day in the EU but it's mostly either insignificant or completely harmless to even report about and cause unnecessary panic. Most crucial systems in astablisments like refineries that could potentially be harmful are exclusively localized and far away from internet access. On-line sub systems are usually just used for monitoring and some things that can be remotely controlled are extremely controlled requiring multiple both digital and physical failsafes. My brothers friend works for a digital safety contractor for companies in the energy sector (not the top tier ones, but still) and he said that it's way the fuck easier to hack some Swiss bank (good luck with that) then anything to do with energy production/delivery and the most effective way would be to physically destroy it.
Whats worse, whenever thing like this happens, individuals carrying attack indicted and not the nations. Basicly Russia is doong cryminal activites online(cyber war!) but individual soldiers are blamed for it and not the state.

I wish every reporter would press each GOP politician who criticized Biden over this and ask them if they think the President should’ve gone against the advice of our top military and intelligence officials last week. But of course a lot these people did all this from their safe zones (Fox News, Newsmax, tweets, truth social) so they wouldn’t have to answer to that.

It’s really fucking stupid that Republicans were/are bashing Biden over that whole thing. Biden obviously listens and respects what the top military and intelligence officials were telling him him after it was spotted, and he was going to take their recommendations and advice on it, which is what he did.

The media is speaking about climate change 24/7 anyways. This is just more noise over a topic that is in everybodies head in Germany anways. All it causes is eye rolling at a time politics make ever greater enrvironmental changes anyways.
As someone who was quite active in climate protests, also with extinction rebellion in Germany, in any of these protests when we heard an ambulance, we cleared the streets. Any emergency was communicated by deescalation teams and then we acted to make space for people to get through. But when you glue yourself on the damn street, there is no way to make space. This should be stopped. Generally, I learned that blocking roads in the wrong places is absolutly dangerous, for the own life and others. I wonder that no one drove anyone of the last generation protesters over yet.

>News Corp made more than $140 million in taxable income but didn’t pay any tax. Apart from $200,000 in tax from its investment arm in 2018 and $8 million in tax from its Foxtel investment arm in 2016, News Corp has paid no tax for many years in Australia, and in fact has received more in taxpayer handouts than it has paid in tax in total. In contrast, Nine paid $109 million in tax from $364 million in taxable income.
Oh dude, our misguided gov has given licence to reopen a coal mine and restart a few coal fired power stations. And the coal we have left is dirty sulferous stuff, not good.

I would have to guess it'll depend on how they organize afterwards. A lot of the equipment will also have gone through a tough war and most is older stuff. Probably a lot will be scrapped, some might be returned if working and still used in those countries inventories. It'll take a long time since I'm sure they'll want to reduce equipment variety and restart their own arms industry again.
I doubt it,if anything Ukraine will keep receiving military aid for years in the future. The conflict will be there forever now ( no matter how this war goes) so it would not make sense to send it back.

I believe a lot of countries are using the aid to Ukraine also as a way to offload dated or overstocked equipment. Essentially, the donation to Ukraine is a good excuse to replace them with newer systems.

For example, Germany is in the process of replacing its Marders with a new IFV called the Puma. Hence why they are willing to donate the Marders.

As such, I wouldn’t expect any country to ask for its donated systems back. They will be worn out and already replaced. Doesn’t really make sense to keep a stockpile of worn and outdated stuff.

Similarly, the French last year were looking to update the Caesar platform. Instead of retrofitting the existing systems, they are now probably donating (most of) them to Ukraine and just ordering the upgraded version new.

I mean the replacement/upgrade program of the Caesar was announced already 5 days before the actual invasion started. I do think the whole program got hurried along at a greater pace since then to make these donations possible though.

My point isn’t to so much to say that stuff going to Ukraine is outdated and bad. Simply that countries are using the opportunity to justify buying even better stuff.

All nice and dandy, but that still doesn’t change anything about my comments above. Yes it will take a while, but still they are using the opportunity to justify even getting the new system. I never said they didn’t dip into supplies to do it.

Yes peace time. Is the French or any NATO army currently directly fighting Russia? Is the whole economy diverted to arms production? No? That’s what we call peace time economy.

Also, your examples are just bad. F22 was never intended to replace the F16/F18, it fulfils a different role. And large vessels like aircraft carriers are not at all comparable to artillery pieces, as you only have one/a few and they take way longer to replace. French isn’t handing over all its artillery, they still keep plenty for their own immediate needs. Guess you’d know either of these things if you didn’t watch so much Teletubbies.

Again, if for one second you’d actually read, you’d see that I didn’t say they are not dipping into their own stockpiles to supply Ukraine. That still doesn’t mean that they are not using the “oh look our stockpiles are running low” as an excuse to upgrade. Militaries always have to justify why they need the money for new equipment, and what better justification than “we generously provided support to Ukraine”.

There will probably be some downsized of the Ukrainian army. As war-time numbers are not sustainable long-term.

Of course. The upside is that they will probably downsized by retiring Soviet gear (or at least putting them in deep storage) and keeping at least part of the NATO equipment.

I do wonder what would this mean for the Ukrainian Arms Industry, tho. Prior to the war it was decently sized.
When authoritarian politicians use the religious extremists to gain power and further their goals, your country is not really a democracy anymore. Netanyahu has ensured that the future of Israel is not as a global leader in justice, equal rights, or democracy.
The problem with religious ideologies is they judge the success of an action on results in the next life, not the real world. So arguments like "your policies will sink the economy" or "your policy will get as all killed" don't impact religious fanatics in the same way they do secular politicians.

I drive mostly full time for 5 different gig apps. I run my business pretty efficiently. My exact cost per mile has been 22 cents including all maintenance, depreciation and business use insurance. I drive a 2015 Honda fit with 106k miles. I'm also putting aside about 8 cents a mile for major repairs.

Russians don't seem too bothered taking all those losses, I wonder how much longer the Ukranians can keep it up.

Tge losses are tough to follow because each side has its own inflated numbers of the other and reduced numbers for themselves. Russia has 3 times the population though. That said, invaders always lose more. It's a fkn mess.

Honestly this is very serious. A war of attrition favours Russia due to population size. This has happened basically like I thought it would.... Russia rush in but don't achieve decapitation strike western help and intel allows a counterstrike, but Russia digs in and galvanises its resources. They're talking 500k troops. If we use history as our guide then we know when Russia is at war they will not cave in due to troop losses, no way. My belief is this will get extremely serious. We are sending Serious weapons intel and money, and Ukraine are hyper invested and focused. Russia is also fully invested and about to have another push. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the Ukrainian line cracks soon. That said, Russia may not be able to capitalise on a breakthrough because of the weapons, supply, tactics and intel we send.
A lot of it might happen where there isn't enough gov order and resources to manage the situation properly like in south asia (india etc). These places must acknowledge that its an inevitable future and must build culture around it so people can handle that situation. These countries also need to make deals with other countries so they can move these people away to higher ground. Country's borders wouldn't matter when hundreds of millions of people start moving. It'll be chaos. Better option is to prepare to handle it properly.

I would exercise restraint when adjudicating someone's ethnic heritage in general, but being strict about name changes has a very weird anti woman context and specifically there is a very weird issue in America where everybody expects everybody from Mexico to fit a particular ethnic model. They have people with Polish and Germanic names in Mexico, too. The idea you change your name to something your constituents can spell and pronounce is not fraudulent or unique in any way. People are often really weird about Eastern European names in the US and there's a long history of that. Louie CK isn't lying about his ethnic heritage, you know?

I mean it sincerely because what I am seeing from other higher ranking Russian officials is that they believe Putin is too soft and Ukraine should be covered in nuclear blasts. Not that there shouldn't be a war.
If it was just "one person's delusion" then regardless of their perceived power there would be no war. It takes hundreds of thousand soldiers, millions people involved and a silent majority agreement to make it happen. Otherwise hundreds of different factors would block that attempt altogether.

Among normal population however and polls conducted we are still seeing a fairly high approval rates for this war (used to be higher but then mogilization has started). And these are fairly accurate polls (because yes, it is possible to get accurate results by asking the right questions even in oligarchies). Russians loved 2014 Crimea's invasion, it boosted Putin's popularity for years to come for instance.

Let's not deceive ourselves - this was approved by entire upper echelons of Russian government and had a huge support from the general populace. It's becoming a problem to some Russians now because instead of a quick victory it has turned into an uncertain conflict. But there were very few voices opposing it from the start.

This is against the company, not Trump himself. Even if they determine some small-ish level of crime (below $2M), the company may likely go defunct and would have to dissolve like his charitable organization. It may do that anyway if the NY civil suit wins against it since that is one of the things it is seeking. That hurts Trump far more than any jail sentence would, since it's so unlikely that he would get one anyway, and since this is his bread and butter (or was, since his international Presidential grifts seem to have far exceeded anything business-related, though that may be arguable, given his properties were largely Russian laundry machines, purportedly). Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

A lot of European countries have strict rules regarding what’s allowed as swimwear. I’ve noticed in the US, people can generally wear whatever tf they want in pools including diapers (🤮 ). Even the showers are optional. In Europe, there’s a much bigger expectation that you don’t contribute to dirtying the pool water including showering before entering and wearing clothes meant solely for swimming and nothing else and the backlash with Burkhinis isn’t that they’re Muslim, but that being Muslim shouldn’t justify making an exception in the rules that everyone else follows. Europe is a big place and not every place does this and I’m sure some people use this reasoning to hide their bigotry but I’m just pointing out that it’s a more complex issue involving local customs and religious requirements and not just “Muslims bad.”.
Mate I’m probably up there with most anti-religious person on this site but this is the dumbest far fetched take there is. No one in Switzerland is voting to make a religious garb mandatory.

It’s not unknowable. It’s obvious. Switzerland is not a Muslim country and will never be majority. Theocracies need a majority or a power base and they have neither there.

What that will allow the government to do is double down on violating and occupying Palestinian territory, it will discriminate against gays, etc., despite Netanyahu saying that's not the case. (Members of his government will continue to push for anti-gay laws and policy.).

This NEVER happens the other way. I never get some weird result that has leftist content. In fact, I don't even get weird neutral or apolitical results that don't make sense.

I'll look up videos about Warhammer 40,000 lore and I dont get some random-ass unrelated game instead. I don'teven get "sorta close but wrong" results like Warcraft or War Thunder....but JOE ROGAN DESTROYS WOKE CULTURE sure as fuck will show up.

Earlier today I was looking for nirvana live at the paramount videos and it legitimately kept giving me recommendations that were all basically. THE DEATH OF AMERICA. BIDEN MUST BE REMOVED and other nonsense shit. I put not interested and block them but those fuckers keep appearing.

YouTube? Music videos, anime and video game reviews, sci-fi & fantasy movie trailers, cooking and household DIY repair stuff....but then Joe Rogan, Benny Shapiro, and some random-ass Fox News clips constantly show up.
Problem with the data is that we do not know if these are solely new car sales or used car sales. The data from KBB, from the article, only cites new cars which are down from the previous year by double-digits. So, I presume whomever wrote this article is omitting that the resales are up not new EV purchases.
During the gas crisis in the 1970s we saw a massive explosion in fuel efficiency, we went from 7mpg muscle cars to 30mpg econoboxes in a matter of years.

Massive economic upheaval and international conflict would not have been my preferred means to spur EV adoption, but I'm not gonna turn my nose up at it either.

Shit, if we don't hurry our butts up on sustainable energy sources that will still hold true. If we have to burn shit to create the electricity that goes into the car we didn't really solve anything.

Of course, doing any of this without immediately going after things like cruise ships is all bluster. 1 hour of cruise ship operation uses something like 850 car-lifetimes of gasoline.
Neither. The realistic situation is that China is a world power unto itself and doesn’t face the false dichotomy you’re painting. China is hugely interdependent with the United States and it will not intentionally burn that bridge, but China is also a proud nation that cannot be seen to be acting as a puppet of the United States, so it will deal with Russia in ways that demonstrate it’s independence without incurring a response from the U.S.

Hardly, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the event was made public to gain leverage in negotiations with them. Now China is obliged to seek face and incentivized to bolster the reputation of their relationship with the U.S.

Speaking of which, your Forbes article very carefully skirts the assertion that the trade China is doing with Russia is in goods that can only be interpreted to be weapons and uses a lot of weasel words to imply that conclusion.
Its almost like if you release murderers from Russia's hellish prison system, they will continue to murder.. and there is no love lost on the people who held them there in the first place.
I think you're right, but there's a difference between giving a criminal a gun and saying "See that nation, I don't want to." And saying "All the friends and family you know on the outside are under threat of foreign invaders, help us defend our home".

The Russian criminal has no reason to want to fight this war beyond getting out of prison, and it's very obvious they are meat for the grindr. The Ukrainian prisoners most likely have friends and family on the outside who are suffering because of russian occupation and IIRC they aren't being conscripted so much as being offered the opportunity.

“Would you like to stay in this box, or fight alongside your countrymen and friends to defend our nation of Ukraine?”.

Russia have repeatedly stated that they want Ukraine to "not exist". That applies to Ukrainian prisoners too. It's in the best interests of even the most sociopathic to use their murdery skills against people who are trying to genocide them.

And that’s not even getting into the fact that you equated Christianity with “the church” and that there are billions of Christians with a very wide variety of views. Some Christians in South America don’t even have Bibles or churches and only have a handful of stories provided through a radio. I’m not hijacking the thread, I’m calling out how ignorant it is.

I was groomed for what this country is experiencing now. It was the goal. Never let them tell you they were deceived. This is what the leaders wanted. It's sick.

Wow I’ve had to say this to a lot of people. Not surprising at all though, people in the west have been treating all religions as Christianity throughout the past few centuries or so.
