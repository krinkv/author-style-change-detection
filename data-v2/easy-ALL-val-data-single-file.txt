My point still stands - with all their democracy and freedoms americans were unable to prevent the invasion. Moreover, some Americans even supported the invasion. But no one called them fascists at that time, because everyone knew that it's the government to blame and its lies and propaganda. What's the difference now? Are you implying that we, russians, as a nation are somewhat bad or inferior? Who is a fascist here?
These are obviously not laws passed in the interest of "protecting our children", given their callous disregard for life both at home and basically anywhere Russia conducts its foreign policies and "special military operations". It can only be concluded, along with those distracting and dividing with their culture war legislation against the LGBTQ+ community everywhere, that they are just projecting, are hugely insecure in their own sexuality, disproportionately pedophiles themselves, and afraid of allowing that light of justice and truth shine on themselves lest it disturb the shit out of everyone.

Not sure what else you drew from that. I could go more into detail if you're confused but I'm not here to type you an essay on the matter...

I agree. Distinguishing between ideology and application muddies the waters a little, as with any other political philosophy. But yeah, right wing anarchists and right wing libertarians should, at their logical conclusion allow for anyone to marry, and you could argue abolish the institution as a whole. I imagine a pure anarcho capitalist would probably support the dissolution of the state, and therefore marriage, but idk if any of them have genuinely thought that far ahead.

Anarcho capitalists are nut jobs but their philosophy would probably support same sex marriage. They’re essentially libertarians that are even more anarchist in nature, because as noted libertarians don’t actually believe in libertarianism, they are just disgraced tea partiers.

LG: Gay? I wish! If I were gay, there'd be no problem. No, what I have is a romantic abnormality, one so unbelievable that it must be hidden from the public at all costs.

"Congress has no right to my testimony," he responded. "We have a separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States. And I believe it would establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House.".
I remember him more for his mishandling of the HIV problem, and his religious-freedom-to-discriminate law that cost the state billions due to everyone else boycotting Indiana, I guess I had bought into the "humble background" myth he's created around himself, didn't realize his family had owned around 100 gas stations.

You are the product. Keep thinking about that until you understand it. This is not a dig, you are probably cool and all but when you get that it changes everything. True here as well but in a more benign sense. On twiitter and facebook it is malignant.

For what, doing his job? A job so blatantly straightforward, in a situation that Dan Quayle was the voice of reason?
Depends. In aggregate it comes off as a conspiracy, but all the testimony seems to suggest they were just throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what would stick. I don't think they'll find that Trump & cronies planned the Jan 6 violence, but they were aware violence could happen and used violent rhetoric with the mob anyway. The people central to the fake elector theme seemed to think they could justify it based on some obscure untried legal theory, but they also had other advisors telling them it wasn't legit. Asking Pence to refuse cerification was public knowledge and Pence refused publicly. All the court challenges were frivolous but I don't think they were illegal. For someone in the thick of it, it probably felt less like a coup and more like a lot of desperate people suggesting a lot of bad ideas.

Pence is fundamentalist-christian-crazy, but I don't think he's MAGA-QAnon-crazy, and he's definitely not Rebel-Against-The-DOJ-because-they're-the-deep-state-crazy.
The phase where indictment is appealed because it's unconstitutional for someone who holds leverage and threatens Senators. This will be appealed multiple times until the Supreme court agrees to put it on it's docket, later. When it comes up it is pushed back to the lower court where that judge is charged with bias because he has ethnic origins of someone Trump has publicly made vulgar statements about. An investigation is made into this judge and his name becomes a rally cry of extremist groups and he is forced to step down. A new judge is installed and there is a national discourse of this judge who makes a statement of impartiality despite owning 2 Trump memorabilia stores, a backer in a Trump golf course, and a condo in Trump's ass. He rules for Trump and the media and everyone watching has forgotten entirely what this case was and pin their hopes on Trump being indicted on charges of obstruction of justice for not providing evidence on a character assassination charge over a rape allegation that was ruled could move forward in 2018 and Trump publicly admits on social media that he knew her, he raped her, and that she was much more rap worthy back in the 90's.
Blah, blah, blah. How many phases are there? I can't keep track. This is just like the Trump is going to be indicted any day now headlines we have been hearing for years. I am not holding my breath that justice will ever be served.

Classification is complicated. Remember, some (not all, but some) of Hillary Clinton’s classified emails on a personal email account were on matters that were retroactively classified after the fact and weren’t yet classified when they landed in her inbox.

We don’t know if Biden’s documents threatened national security or if these were rather mundane documents — probably will never know unless the DOJ reviews and releases a broad summary, but my suspicion is if you looked at every corner of the federal gov’t, both parties, and all branches, it is probably not that uncommon that some very small degree of classified documents end up lost in other boxes/storage of other documents and get forgotten about.

That is not how it work. Biden returned the documents as soon as they were discovered- he get slap on risk.
The Charisma thing is a problem, but he also just doesn't seem to do well pushing back against other politicians criticizing him. He's a master at attacking easy targets like public education, public servants, public health officials, and Disney World, but I'm not sure he's going to be able to stand up to the social media pummeling that Trump will give him.
Why? Why on earth would he have a chance to “destroy” Biden? He celebrates literal every policy that fucked the GOP over in the last two elections. No one is going to buy that he’ll suddenly morph into a moderate if he’s put in the White House. Once the Election Machine really gets going, his every shit bag policy will be spread to every corner of the internet. He’s too Trumpish to appeal to Independents, but has none of Trumps showmanship!or charisma. Biden actually DOES have a lot of really good policies to hold up and have celebrated,’in addition to the incumbent’s advantage.

This. And the other thing us westerners need to get through our thick skulls is that they are always seeking to dominate. Always a zero sum game. There is no win win situation when dealing with them. "Win win" should always be be auto-translated to "we'll work with you because we're not strong enough to subjugate you....yet." Isn't it obvious? Look what they do to their own people.
That's the real strenh of democracy vs authoritarianism: it's much harder for one psycho to amass enough power to start tearing up treaties and changing the whole country's direction on a whim, and if it does happen it’s much easier for his enemies to restrain his excesses and boot him from power.

Yep, absolutely. Everyone is so outraged by the actions of Russia and China, and it is so easy to justify our offenses in their eyes. Doesn’t make what other countries do acceptable, but it does certainly negate the moral authority and superior we seem to regard ourselves with. The United States and Western countries have and will commit similar atrocities if it benefits us.
Claim that nazis were denazified, zombies put back in their graves, Jewish space lasers dismantled and the Martians are going back to Mars with all their tails between their legs and go home claiming victory. That's about on par with the bullshit their media spawns.
Tl;dr Russia doesn't have the industrial capacity to make competitive military hardware. It doesn't exist. So their GDP is not really relevant.

A pole once told me. "Most country's flags symbolize something with their colors. Like the french flag is blue for liberty, white for peace, and red for glory. Well ours does too. It's red for the russian blood we wish to spill, and white for the russian skulls we wish to stack.".

America couldn't occupy Iraq with only 200k (they ended up with over 500k) and that was after utterly crushing one of the world's best militaries in a few weeks, and with the majority of the local population actively supporting their presence. Russia never had a chance of occupying Ukraine, just maybe the land bridge to Crimea.

It's authoritarianism, but it's also vagueness used deliberately. By drafting intentionally vague laws, it lets them sell the laws to the public, and counter opposition, by claiming there are exemptions, but it also lets them prosecute people whenever they like. They want the benefit of a narrow law that only applies in some circumstances because that's what's popular and defensible, but they also want the benefit of a strict law because then they can punish people and feed red meat to the base. The vagueness lets them always blame someone else and say they did the wrong thing. If a woman dies, they can blame the doctor for not performing an abortion, but if that doctor had performed the abortion and the woman had lived, they could also say the doctor was wrong to perform it and prosecute.

If a doctor lets a patient die by not performing an abortion, they can blame the doctor, the hospital, etc, for failing to provide an abortion that was included in an exception. If, on the other hand, the doctor had performed the abortion, they could just as easily prosecute the doctor for performing a forbidden abortion. The vague drafting is deliberate, because it puts anyone who would provide abortions in a lose-lose situation, which can then be used to turn the public against them, or to bring them before a medical board and possibly lose their license to practice medicine.

If they wanted to, they could draft a law with clearly delineated lines, saying abortion is not allowed in these circumstances, is allowed in those, and is allowed in some others when it's necessary in the judgment of doctor. That they didn't draft these laws that way is intentional. They know how not to be vague, and they certainly have access to people outside the legislature who know how to avoid vagueness, but they chose to be vague anyway.

And put that up against Pelosi's record and she still comes out ahead. Delivering healthcare to tens of millions of Americans, getting the country out of two recessions, helping protect Americans from a pandemic, overseeing two impeachments and that's just off the top of my head.

fellow restaurant-worker-turned-IT here. On top of everything you've mentioned, I was a tipped employee so I don't even know how paid sick leave would have worked. Would they just pay me the average for that day? There's no way any restaurant would want to pay someone who stayed home from their own coffers, if you call out then they just call someone else in and the tips go to them.

Exactly! I was a food prep worker at a fast food restaurant, so I was one of the first to show up. I tried calling in sick, was told it was "unacceptable" and that I had to come in anyway. I later got fired for working too slowly, because I was sick. That same place made me push the issue when I noticed the 'fresh' chicken had a smell and had a weird, blue color. They didn't accept that it was bad until I told them a third time and refused to prep with it anymore. They still cooked and sold the stuff I'd prepped before that. (I'm not saying which company it was, because every store has different management some try to do better for their staff/customers.).

It's depressingly common. I'm currently over a year into litigation against a school that did this in PA, CEO said similar things regularly, i'm told average is 2-3 years to reach a settlement, in the best possible scenario. In the meantime, most employers won't touch me with a 10-ft pole. Also their only legal obligation in the end is for them to pay the difference between what I would've made at their job vs what I actually made instead. Would sure be nice if Biden and congress emboldened the NLB, and/or Shapiro and the newly Democratic state house made right to work laws a priority. As long as the entire system is stacked in their favor, employers will continue to act this way.

Exactly. Universities have raised tuition far in excess of cost of living causing the youth of America to do deep into debt instead of being able to grow the country. It has become a business and the kids are just consumers with no price limits.

In the ER you are entitled only to a medical screening exam. This can be from anyone licensed to do one. I’m an ER doc and Private equity backed contract management groups swept in and forced out every democratic physician owned group in our city in a 2 yr period. All started cutting physician hours and stretching their responsibilities. Queue the influx of PAs and largely under qualified/educated (fault of the system, not them before they jump on me) NPs. If you demand to see a MD/DO they may oblige but by no means have to and speaking from experience, any demands made to be seen by a certain person will start off the encounter on the wrong foot. That being said, if my loved one came to the ED for something serious or rare, I would insist they be seen by a doc😅. I would probably be better at knowing whether they were appropriately triaged though. I and for some things, say laceration repair, I’d actually prefer the NP to one of my Physician colleagues based on who has more recent reps.

It’s stupid, but it is what it is. I had a patient from Netherlands once, and I had to explain to him that I’m not asking his religion for discrimination of whatever it’s just standard practice, something that I needed to write down in the medical record for accountability. He said he’s an atheists, so I ask him if I can just put him down as protestants as they usually don’t have any restrictions for drug prescriptions or whatever, so it’s less of a hassle. He agreed and that was that.
Or, and hear me out, they’ll end up like me where they’re forced to bear the full weight of a lifetime of mental and psychological abuse from these kinds of parents and then turn to drugs as a way of coping and it’ll fuck them up even more until they’re 30 and have no idea what life will hold for them but know that it won’t be good probably.

1. Non-registered donors (“new donors”) take a couple of weeks to process before they can donate blood for the first time. There’s no certainty any of them will be a match for the child or eligible to be donors, and even if they are, they can only donate one unit of whole blood every 3-4 months each. If the child needs further transfusions before the donors can donate again the problem just comes back.
Because Erdoğan has demanded that it be the official name at the UN and for diplomatic matters. The English name is still "Turkey" but people who think that that makes them look smart use "Türkiye" now even though they shouldn't. Erdoğan and the Turkish people certainly wouldn't use "The United States of America" when speaking in their own language if Biden made the same demand at the UN. Actually, no Turkish people uses "Türkiye" when speaking in English, they're 100% aware how cringe it would sound. Reason for that demand from Erdoğan: "I'm a strong leader See I can force them to say "Türkiye" ".
exactly. every country uses their native names for places, because it's easier for them. imagine every country now demanding to use their way of writing or even their letters is just dumb.

Absolutely. Sometimes nothing happens, sometimes they don't like your face, want to make an example or want you out because your discourse threaten them and that's it, they'll throw things like "Attack on the Turkish identity" at you and you're done.
To be fair, wether one is religious or not, I think it is fair to try to respect everyone’s beliefs and assume that not every individual shares a congruent faith who believes in “god”. I can’t say “ all Muslims are X or all Jewish people are Y or all Christians are Z” without making a blanket statement inference. Religion has been the cause of many a people’s problems since the dawn of man but there are individuals who exist who follow a religion and are genuinely good individuals. And let’s not forget, it’s nor relegion itself that creates all this heinous, barbaric moments in time but also man himself who uses his religion and hand to bring down another human being. It takes both a concept / belief/.. aka religion.. and a modern day materialized body of flesh creature (human) for such atrocities to even happen. Many people have religion and want to live peacefully. It’s those in power who use it to their own discretion at the expense of the own people the govern that is the issue. When that women was killed in Iran (or wherever it was) by the religious police recently it became the people vs the government. Both sides mostly consisted of people sharing the same belief yet warring with each other. Going to war with people of religion would be an endless war. We can complain about it or we can find a way to live with each other. I.
The point is, this ideas can spread mostly because religion creates a fértile enviroment for then, if we teached people to think, to analyze and use method to build world views we would be faar more advanced as Societies (but to be fair its not a religion but a power thing). Instead we get irrational humans with ground beliefs that defy reality and logic.

These types of generalizations are completely unhelpful and only serve to drive Serbs away from the EU and towards Russia. Obviously the government of Serbia would not be involved in this type of plot, the risks would be far too great even if they felt inclined to do so. However, it's no secret that a substantial of the Serbian population has a pro-Russian sentiment and thereby serves as a potential recruiment pool for Russia.
Secondly, by saying things like "Ofcourse Serbia will help Russia", one is artificially pushing them towards Russia by creating sentiment among the pro-EU people that Serbia is "bad".

That does not mean "Serbia" is helping Russia, it means some Serbs may have been recruited by Russia. Big difference.

Crazy how back then us and the American used to be allies and now American kids are trying to justify hatred for Serbs because an Austohungarian national killed the Austrohungarian heir to the throne in a forcefully annexed region, which Austohungary used as an excuse to murder 3/4 Million Serbs in an attempt to expand their empire.

By voting against it in the UN? By not recognizing the breakaway regions of Crimea and Donbas? By Selling weapons to Ukraine? How exactly is it helping Russia?
Obviously, there are exceptions to this and some people more in the center or right also "speedrun". However, they more than sufficient to prove the rule, rather than contrast it.
in every thread that isn't even remotely related to the US there's at least one American that never left his hometown living his life existing his existence as a global politics expert fighting on the very frontlines of cyberspace from their mother's basement using the vast knowledge they've gathered from esteemed political subreddits to remind us: that no matter how many children die of hunger and medical malpractice in Africa or how many women are oppressed in the middle east and Asia (for the most serious and hereditary crime of being alive), it doesn't matter how widespread yet barely talked about corruption is in almost every European country, America is the worst country on earth.

Look! A republican asking for solutions. Your party has zero solutions, they arnt in that game. The only solution Your people want is a " final solution ".
Realistically, the corrupt officials will be replaced by other corrupt officials. There's too much money involved and too much power concentrated in key committees.

It's not just the fact that thousands of people died building these stadiums in the middle of a dust bowl that will just rot away after the tournament is finished, but the fact that Qatar also has backwards religious laws around women, homosexuality, and alcohol, the fact they've already went back on their word regarding a deal about beer in stadiums, and have already harassed and threatened to destroy the camera of a Danish journalist before the tournament even began, spells disaster.

Regarding the clothing laws, if they came to the West for a tournament and we said they had to follow our "culture and values" and expose their shoulders, arms, etc., they'd be up in arms.

Yes. There likely is at least some written communication between Gym/his lawyers and the Jan 6 committee providing his excuse for not complying with the subpoena. Throw the language back at him.

Really? What a waste of time, yes the Democrats went after Trump for January 6th but if the tables we're turn Biden would be in jail and not running for office again.

Exactly. Biden should cite the precedent they set of ignoring subpoenas and just ignore whatever else they say from there on. It’s like dealing with a toddler. Their tantrums don’t matter if you ignore them. They only become a problem if their parents cater to them whenever they throw one. The dems should let the GQP scream in a corner. Eventually they’ll tire themselves out and the American public will tune them out.

that’s actually physically accurate. While everyone has preferences, the vast majority of the time coffee tastes best warm/hot but not freshly boiled. After brewing it’s best to let it cool for a minute or two for the best flavour. It’s to do with thermodynamics and how individual coffee molecules behave at certain temperatures.

Considering that the Imperium and the Imperial Guard more specifically were, basically, based on an exaggeration of WW 1 and 2 Soviet tactics and army composition, the similarities aren't really that surprising.

50? This is permanent damage that will degenerate the country into another North Korea for multiple GENEREATIONS. Russia will never recover from this unless their entire state and political system, includibg the according people, are eradicated from the root and rebuilt. Which will never happen, given the history of the country.

If former President Donald Trump decides to use his newly reinstated Facebook and Instagram accounts he will be free to post election conspiracy theories and QAnon content without the likelihood of his account being banned again.
When it comes to other controversial topics, like casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election or sharing QAnon content, Meta says that it will take some action, but it won’t remove the offending posts or restrict Trump’s ability to post new updates.

IF china created a land mass and actually had a steady population on that landmass, it very much would in very real legal terms extedn their teritorial waters. there are also habited islands they claim ownership of that the philinines and other nations ALSO claim ownership of. IF no one else contested those claims.. be it through use of force, or trade/negotiation with the other countrys that claim ownership. then again there would be a very real argument for extending their teritorial waters.

This is hopefully the last and only time I ever say anything good about this monster, but in the most important moment of his entire life, faced with the most monumental decision he will ever make, he acted against a lifetime of programming and did the only right thing, when he had the opportunity and incentive to do any number of wrong things.

And here the answer is no - not as a nation. It is said there were no official Polish institutions (like governmental bodies), which supported Germans (in particular in antisemitic activities), that Polish (underground) institutions persecuted a collaboration with Germans in that regard (known as szmalcownicy), and while some Poles were responsible for such crimes- still they were crimes, and there are also numerous examples of completely different approach (like e.g. Irena Sendler).
Imperial Japan should repesent a very different warning; the horror of unaccountability, a refusal to take responsibility at any point, and how it just ends you up in the exact same horror show except no one wants to admit they got there because everyone who could have done something about it shirked the responsibility until it was too late.

You are right. In Poland we often remember the good, tolerant parts of our history, but we get very defensive when antisemitism, pogroms are mentioned.

I do agree that pre-war Poland could have done more to combat antisemitism, to foster integration. But I also don''t believe that any kind of policy would stop the industrial genocide brought by Germans.

Far too little far too late. Where was this energy in 2016? Where was the energy when the Republican Party literally had the ability to remove Trump from office? They had their chance to distance themselves from his rhetoric and chose not to. So why now?

They are all "I" and "me" instead of "we" and "us" when defining their version of America. All privilege and no responsibility. Which explains how Trump came to represent their party.

Yup. This is why many advised McCarthy not to do this; because it sets a precedent and opens the door to GOP getting swept right out next time they lose the House. Well, he did it anyway. So...he will reap what he sows.

Problem with that is it will lead to a pyrrhic victory - Russia can in theory send several million people and build several thousand newish tanks over the next few years. But doing so will completely demolish their economy for decades to come. It would be a prolonged death of Russia as a country as it means spending 50% of it's GDP on warfare rather than on... literally anything else. Doing so also means abandoning all other fronts and letting West to set the rules for countries like Armenia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Venesuela, Syria and so on which will be devastating long term as some of these are major energy resources exporters themselves.
Yes. Also like the Civil War faction but mostly like the country itself. There's been several Russias in the past (the most famous historical example being Kievan Rus) but Belarus was named Belarus before the other White Russians came to prominence. .

Considering Belarus political stance there also wouldn't be NATO assistance. Even for Ukraine we only started sending over gear few weeks into the conflict when we have realized it's actually possible for Ukraine to win and they were aligned with west. Belarus is not. It might get it's chance if Russia gets defeated in Ukraine and something happens internally that gathers their attention. Like their tsar dying creating a power vacuu,. In that case it could be possible (but still risky) to potentially do so without a massive loss of life.

Ultimately, America functions as a "Representative Democracy." We vote in officials who represent our ideas, concerns, and desires within the government. Even in the US, voters sometimes directly vote for laws in referendums. The representatives that the citizens elect make most choices for us because it is simply impractical to expect millions of people to meet at the local town square to discuss budgets, taxes, and construction. We elect the representative whose ideas match closest to our own to deal with these.

Sure, Article 5 doesn’t require military intervention, but the Polish people are the second-most Anti-Russian populace in Europe. If their President said Russia killed Poles with a missile, they’d be baying for blood. This response avoids that and saves face for everyone except Ukraine.

This is a bad narrative. The legal system is perfectly capable of acting quickly. Nearly everyday there is a new video of a police officer legally executing a citizen for an imaginary breaking of the law sometimes within seconds of encountering them.

Depleted? We have more weapons than the entire world. The budget is sky high. The weapons will never be depleted, unless of course the military budget is being siphoned away by people not actually spending it on the military, which is exactly how Rome fell btw.
Relevant excerpt: "Archaeological evidence suggests that the Israelites primarily emerged natively from Canaan. A number of scholars do not believe that the exodus has any historical basis at all, while only those on the fundamentalist fringes accept the entire biblical account "unless [it] can be absolutely disproved". The current consensus among archaeologists is that, if an Israelite exodus from Egypt occurred, it must have happened instead in the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt (13th century BC), given the first appearance of a distinctive Israelite culture in the archaeological record. The potential connection of the Hyksos to the exodus is no longer a central focus of scholarly study of the Hyksos, but this supposed connection to the Exodus has continued to inspire popular interest.".
For such a massive event that would have had social, economic, and cultural consequences ranging for hundreds of years across the region, there is zero archaeological evidence to back up the biblical accounts.

Are you insinuating that being attracted to trans people is perverse? I doubt it, but nonetheless your sentence frames it that way. But to your point, I think you're unhelpfully discounting what is actually a fairly important pattern in culture; closeted/unfulfilled people seeking access to the objects of their desires by indirect methods, because they don't feel like they can use direct methods. This often times manifests as becoming prominent social figures which allows them to compensate for their otherwise undesirable or dysfunctional personalities in order to get the things they want. Sexually abusive priests for instance. Do you honestly think it so unfathomable, that corrupt republicans would take advantage of their strangleholds in their territory to satiate sexual needs, regardless of the moral or legal aspects? This exact thing has happened many many times in this country already. And many times has a closeted Republican who is an outspoken bigot been outed in the midst of sexual deviancy.

One of the highlights of my senior year in high school (2000-2001) was reading Newsweek every week in my social studies class. 20+ years later I still remember their quality reporting on the 2000 presidential election. A damn shame what's happened to it.
The long and short of it is that Japan knew the war was lost but wanted better terms of surrender (they didnt like unconditional surrender at all), and were hoping to either get Russia as a neutral party to negotiate a deal between Japan and the US, or simply to stay out of the fight because they figured the brutal fight for the main islands would make the US rethink their goals and be willing to negotiate something less than unconditional surrender.

Honestly... I'm not so sure it is at this point. I mean, I guess there's biological and chemical, but Russia has launched kinetic missiles with no warheads for lack of conventional missiles. They're in dire straits if they want to win the war.

Not so. Every day Americans hear about and/or are affected by decisions of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, we now have a constant drip drip drip of reports about the current bench: Kavanaugh’s history of sexual abuse and rich white frat boy bullshit. Alito leaking decisions to supporters. Thomas’s wife fostering an insurrection but yet Thomas sitting on cases involving the same election. Barrett the inexperienced religious nut. Somehow the Chief Justice can’t figure who leaked the Dobbs decision. (I call BS.). Ergo, Americans no longer trust the Court. This already is not sustainable and the new documentary will likely push this court deeper into mud.

They are things like (paraphrasing from memory here) "It's not so bad, we have only a few cases and we'll get them taken care of" he cannot acknowledge how much of a threat it was, he has to say that he'll fix it because it is so minor, nothing to worry about. He staked his identity upon it. Then the Reich right wing media had to carry that perspective. Downplay how bad it is. Upshow how easy it is to cure it (just take hydroxychloroquine!).

Why? This change puts men and women at risk. Covid vaccines like all vaccines in general are safe and effective. Don't let the loud minority voices rule the military. do what's right.

If they're putting other prisoners to work in tank factories, I'm sure they could use them for logistics as well. I mean take this guy: doesn't really matter if it's true that he was in prison for illegal logging, but there are probably plenty of people from poor, rural areas that end up in prison for petty crimes like that. I know in Belarus you can go to prison just for being unemployed. And Russia has a 99% conviction rate. Russia is a HUGE country tens of thousands of square kilometers of woodlands that are barely inhabited. I don't think people there who are trying to make a living as loggers are necessarily hardened criminals that will steal everything they can get their hands on the minute you turn your back on them. Especially after having endured prison and being given the chance of earning a pardon.
Yes actually. Keep throwing Russians at Ukraine until they push through, and take land. They’ll just keep throwing soldiers until the they win or run out of soldiers. Or until someone makes a leadership change.

So yes, it is? That's what it sounds like. It's kind of ridiculous to me how we have special grand juries, special counsels, etc., all which are these elaborate processes that take forever and require insane amounts of resources and time... all for basically a report with which one person or some other tiny group of people use to make a final decision - which they can opt out of, anyway. It's all so redundant and promotes the idea that delayed justice is no justice. We seriously need to streamline our justice system. It's incredibly bloated. And I definitely appreciate that "the wheels of justice turn slow" and that it's intentional, and one of the better facets of this country... but it's almost as detrimental, IMHO, and the highest and most egregious criminals know it and abuse it. /rant.

> On 30 January 1933, Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor to head a coalition government; Hitler's far-right Nazi Party held two out of ten cabinet seats. Von Papen, as Vice-Chancellor and Hindenburg's confidant, was to serve as the éminence grise who would keep Hitler under control; these intentions badly underestimated Hitler's political abilities. By the end of March 1933, the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933 had used the perceived state of emergency to effectively grant the new Chancellor broad power to act outside parliamentary control. Hitler promptly used these powers to thwart constitutional governance and suspend civil liberties, which brought about the swift collapse of democracy at the federal and state level, and the creation of a one-party dictatorship under his leadership.
Not a single big fish was punished for 1/6. I actually don’t give a crap about the idiots who entered the Capitol. I care about who in the government planned it and was involved. They are the traitors (and I do not use that word too often).

Reality is constantly changing. The only way you arrive at the conclusion that standing still is the best solution is if your not really looking for a solution but rather conserving a bias.
Despite no longer being general secretary, Jiang still remained in charge of the military during the first year of Hu Jintao's term. Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference. A WikiLeaks transcript showed Hillary Clinton informing her private audience that China's foreign policy was ultimately controlled by their military establishment, not Hu.
They are doing OK? At least in the big cities. There's a difference between outlook and current status quo. Economic activities that generate cash flows are still going the same, paper money perhaps not so much. I've always told my relos off hand to sell up and move abroad if possible. Too much wealth tied up in real estate sitting under a huge demographic bomb.

Not necessarily. While the Saudi royal family is a very authoritarian regime they do make a strong effort particularly internationally to ensure that what they do does not overly affect the economic situation of the country as that would directly harm their personal wealth which is one of the leading drivers keeping them in power quite frankly. China sees maintaining its political strenh as that force.

The testimony came in a Senate intelligence committee hearing that examined Russia’s intrusions in the 2016 election campaign and its intentions, with America’s top intelligence officials testifying just days after they released an unclassified report blaming Moscow for the hacks.

They don't care. Their side wants to rewrite our Constitution and undo any remaining vestige of a democratic republic. They are fully for the Oligarchy of America, which is similar to Russia (hence the support). In short, they're traitors.

not only that but in 2016 the Russians hacked both the RNC and DNC servers, this is a known fact, but then they only released the dirt on Hillary and Dems, so either the RNC server's were clean as a whistle, or there was a little of compromising info on the GOP that the Russians have used to maintain Right wing support among the.

Violent? Probably, but if he has lost influence with Republicans I don't think he is that dangerous, or at least not AS dangerous as he has been over the last 8 years, to the average person. If the worst he can do is throw violent fits and tantrums in private then that is a problem for people who choose to hang out with him.

Russia will not likely have sane leadership until sanity is restored to Russian culture, and even if the years of reality-distorting propaganda was to stop immediately, it will take many years for society, and government, to be deprogrammed. Just look at Putin - the most powerful man in Russia, with access to the world's information via the internet - a resource, like many aging Russians, he does not use, and was therefore entirely oblivious to the reality of conditions in Ukraine, and genuinely believed they were waiting for Russia with open arms. He's now faced with reality, and like many Russians, has just doubled down. And still, he browses the web through little binders of printed off info his advisors give him.
So there was like 7 min video of incident in vk (russian social network), where soldier argue with officer and telling him people don’t want to die without neither proper equipment nor any proper training, closer to ending of video officer tries to physically escalate either by unexpectedly closing by or throwing a slap (don’t remember exactly) for what soldier just push him away, after this physical interactions stopped — so soldier was literally sentenced for “beating” which is just one push which did zero harm to officer (except his ego).

Experience and diplomacy ave usually undervalued in politics. People do not stop to think that it takes years and a lot of effort to build relationships, to understand what motivates the other players, and months of day in and day out attendance in hearings to understand complex matters like waterways and transit, space programs, global trade and tariffs and so on.

Exactly. King and Sanders have something to offer the Democrats. She's holding nothing they want. Play ball with her, she loses. Don't play ball with her, she loses. A Democrat has about an equal chance of winning whether or not Sinema runs independent, so they need to run a candidate. Any chance is better than no chance.

Wow, turns out the vast majority of Republicans/Republican-leaners will vote for the more right-wing candidate and the vast majority of Dems/Dem-leaners will vote for the more liberal candidate, leaving Sinema with a small contingency of enlightened-centrists/moderate Republicans who are mostly cool with LBGTQ people/Andrew Yang stans/“Third Way” PAC enthusiasts/big pharma execs…who woulda thunk it??

Ah yeah. Give me more Germany bashing in the comments. Let us all forget that the Ukrainians can't hit a target with HIMARS without US confirmation or why the US haven't delivered long range rockets much ealier . /s off.
20 years of letting their military stagnate, 20 years of trying to appease the Russians because of cheap gas, and now the Germans still have the gall to defend their abysmal foreign-policy record even as Olaf Scholz continues to suck Daddy-Putins dick while spending nearly a whole year coming up with excuses as to why Ukraine cannot be provided with the most numerous model of tank in Europe, with manufacturing/maintenance infrastructure only a few hours away from Ukraine.

If America exists as long as most of us hope it will this will not be the last time conservatives whip up a violent movement to shatter our Union. We'll be lucky if it's the last one we see this decade.

Possibly? It's already come out in that the main reason they were pushing Georgia, of all the states with close results, so hard is that Georgia is part of the 11th Circuit, and Clarence Thomas reviews emergency petitions from the 11th Circuit (each of the 9 justices is assigned a set of circuit courts that they, alone, are responsible for approving or denying emergency petitions from).

Well, there's 20 permanent House committees and 4 joint House/Senate committees, and each one has somewhere between 9 and 30 members from the majority party, so if it's a sad intellectually impoverished majority like Kevin's yeah a lot of the congresscritters have to do double duty.
George Santos is a joke. He hasn't a once of integrity, let alone any pride or dignity. He thinks his job is there for the taking and how he got there is inconsequential. The message to lie about every aspect of your life and steal what you need in order to get what you want, should be alarming and pathetic to everyone. But, it's just one more message coming from the Republicans these days that will harm them in the end. His presence drags them all down. They have absolutely no foresight whatsoever and the foreshadowing from the midterms seems to have escaped them. I think GS's constituents are ticked and feel duped by him. I hope that they boo his ass off every stage, out of every venue and every public place he goes into. He sucks.
I know you mean well, but the whole "Apartheid state" thing is part of the problem. It erases the actual problem (policies of the Israeli government that harm Palestinians) and replaces it with a national identity. Criticizing Israel's policies acknowledges that they can and should be changed. But if Israel is an Apartheid state, it cannot change while remaining Israeli; that's simply what it is. In other words, you have no recourse but to destroy the state. Which, oddly, also mirrors what the Israeli far-right claims (that they can't make the reforms necessary to ensure the Palestinians' peace and security because it would constitute national suicide) AND what Hamas claims (that they will not accept any outcome other than Israel's total destruction). It also erases the possibility of a two-state solution, wherein Palestinians have a state that is uniquely theirs, because in the Apartheid analogy, Apartheid was dismantled by creating a unitary south African state. But the historical context there was completely different (I could list the reasons but this is getting long-winded already); suffice it to say that it's a very round peg in a very square hole.

It does play into a common right wing talking point. That the Jews are purposely buying off politicians (they go further saying that the money is also being used to destroy American cities.).
Presidential election year turnout, decent map, 12 Republican incumbents sitting in Biden districts, possibility of a new NY gerrymander, Trump might be the Republican nominee (dead weight) or he might be a 3rd party candidate flaming the GOP (even worse).

Oh, Gosar and Greene don't care, but the motivation is purely vengeance. They're going to do something similar for Biden and Harris--I'd guess they're getting impeached at least three times. Most people aren't that interested in committee assignments.

One time I was the victim in a drunk driving accident and the police got me mixed up with someone of a different gender from a different state who had a bunch of warrants... I shit you not this took me 10 years to clear from my record in the police and court computer systems. Did I go before a judge you ask? Why yes I did! With my ID, and printouts from the DMV of my driver's records from Nevada and the other state. The judge meh, flips through the papers concludes I must still have an additional driver's license in the other state. I said 'I brought you the printout of my driver's record from that state your honor. I even have the post it note from the police chief that told the officer he made an error and to give me my license back. And the actual ticket with the wrong number and my ID to show it's an error.' He wouldnt listen or look again because he had made up his mind to side with the police and the error. So I basically asked him to do his job and look at all of the official documentation I brought... and I was then immediately threatened with contempt if I said one more word and removed from the court room by the guard for disrespecting the judge.

There are some votes the founders worried about would just become mob rule, not of the educated and civilized, but the misled, furious, and fooled. America was always meant to work together, the schisms of the two party system falls apart when one side is honestly imo just trying to do harm or being willingly undermined or compromised for other nation's gains. My two cents at least.
The US has spent last 80 years or so in mostly unjustified wars, and as soon as there is a "good" war where the lines between good and evil in a conflict is so clearly defined, where one party is the clear aggressor, bombs hospitals, civilians and infrastructure, rapes , pillages and tortures, commits forceful relocation (aka kidnapping) of entire populations and tries to erase an entire culture. These are warcrimes, and probably crimes against humanity as well, which should honestly disgust most people in the west. Especially the party that supposedly has 'good christian values', but instead they potentially want to abandon almost a century old doctrine of defending democracies and western values.
He's an empty husk of a man, with zero principles left of what little he ever had. This jackass wants to cancel my vote for Senator if GOP doesn't win here in NV. Screw this guy.

It is not even young at this point. As a millennial I will be almost 40 in 2024 and I want student loan forgiveness. I have been told over and over again that people get more conservative as they get older. It is weird that they are spitting in the eye of millennials who are approaching their "older" line in the sand. Maybe they are counting on a massive midlife crisis for an entire generation.
It is not even young at this point. As a millennial I will be almost 40 in 2024 and I want student loan forgiveness. I have been told over and over again that people get more conservative as they get older.

That's interesting, thanks for sharing. I've not seen many from Western sources. Even in my country (Bosnia), it's spelled with a K, albeit closer to the original (Kur'an).
The official Nazi school curriculum prominently featured biological evolution, including human evolution. 3) Nazi racial anthropologists, including SS anthropologists, uniformly endorsed human evolution and integrated evolution into their racial ideology.

And? It seems you don't understand this basic geopolitics move. Turkey stands in the way, so that other nations have to make concessions to them. They don't give a fuck about sweden or their contribution to Nato specifically. It's just about leverage.

So all the food banks, homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, schools, environmental organizations, blood donation centers, community centers, senior centers, hospitals, mental health outreach centers, disaster relief, pregnancy resource clinics, adoption agencies, and everything else Christians do should be banned?

First off, nope. At this stage, thinking somebody as isolated as Sweden joining a defensive pact "increases conflict" is the dumbest shit one can say.

Sweden being in Nato does not increase conflict, also Turkey is just using their chance of blocking to have political leverage. Thats it.

Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, like most Marxists, clearly embraced biological evolution and considered it important in underpinning their atheistic worldview.

This is just plain wrong. Both sweden and finland partake in exercises with nato military. They are very close in military cooperation and diplomatic relations. So when a new war in europe started they obviously thought "Well we're gonna join eventually anyway, why not now".
It's also unfortunately urban planning. Take a look at the ongoing drama with expanding Heathrow airport in London for a good logistics comparison. You can't just "move" people and you must move a lot of people either temporarily or permanently in order to restructure infrastructure. Watar mains, gas pipes, plumbing, roads need to be laid and houses rebuilt. All in all people as a whole hate their lifestyles being uprooted and when you have people who's families have lived in that little house and fought for keeping that house across generations due to rapidly decreasing real-estate availability and rising housing costs for a new home....good luck convincing them you'll "take care of them" if they agree to relocate for infrastructure adjustments when the country is in the state it's in (that's ignoring trust in politicians to even carry through in their promise).
I dunno. I've travel India a fair bit... Kerala up to Mumbai, and most of Rajasthan. It's an incredible place... but also an incredible amount of rubbish, everywhere I went. Probably the least was Hampi, but as soon as you got to anywhere with roads and houses around, just the same, rubbish everywhere. Not sure it's fair to say that western media makes it look bad... It's not really hard.
Pfft. Even with the most extreme ruling possible, they are no longer in a strong enough position in state legislatures to overturn a Presidential election, and when you look at how their internal divisions are now starting to cost them control of legislative chambers even when they hold majorities of seats, I think their position will only weaken further.

Thank you. People were calling me delusional before the Elections for pointing out all the flaws with the idea that the GOP was about to sweep the map and cement permanent minority rule. Fear of that is useful insofar as it provides a motivator to vote (in stark contrast to the complacency of 2016), but if it threatens to spread the sort of blackpilled doomerism that causes people to assume nothing can be done about the situation, then it becomes a real problem because that is when people stop voting.
This makes my blood boils I don’t care that he makes jobs or whatever, he probably has private jets and so many mansion Yet when I was making 40K I ended up with less than 30K that I could see. How come someone can pay $750 on taxes?? What’s wrong with this “democracy .” I feel like instead of going forward, we are going back to pre French Revolution times So mad.. so many big corporations doing whatever the heck they want, killing us with toxic food, stealing from us, paying us crap even though the price of living has increased an outrageous amount in less than 100 years, YET people still care about which pronoun other call them!?
Hey may have donated his salary in previous years (and allegedly plus a little extra to account for taxes taken), but he only did that for the first 2 quarters of 2020, there's no report that I can find that he donated the second half of that salary. So by my count there should be at least $200k taxable income for that year. He straight up lied to the IRS about this.

This is still concerning, because it looks like the new recombinant XBB strain evades humoral immunity from earlier Omicron strains. I got it within a month of getting over an earlier COVID infection, despite being up to date on my boosters. With vaccination rates low in China, and with the spectre of XBB rising, I'm concerned that China will experience back-to-back waves of infections, with the second wave coming as soon as the end of January, if the current wave continues to be powered by earlier-emerging Omicron variants.

Relevant article. Basically it sounds like GA Democrat politicians have been paying attention and are prepared to keep Democrat voters aware and motivated. Which is nice.

I paradoxally want their Republican to win so that the Democrats will get their asses together to keep Hershal Walker out, because I fear that complacency over control of the Senate will destroy voter turnout in the run off.
This is why honestly to some degree, policies do not matter. You have boebert who is dumber than a sack of potatoes, utterly useless, and an utter waste of taxpayer dollars. Without passing a single legislation and doing a damn thing of relevancy, she is still in a close race. I wish i could be paid as much as her to sit around doing nothing, spending my time on Twitter.
Those remaining areas have 50% unaffiliated voters in voter registrations. That is what is what is throwing off the NY Times. The NYT isn't used to west slope voter distribution and are guessing that the remaining votes would split along the dem-rep registered voter percentages. They won't. Unaffiliated voters are the reason Boebert is behind. For instance, Mesa County has 106,000 registered voters, but only 15000 are dems. 40,000 are Republicans. 48000 are unaffiliated. But, the election is roughly 55-45.

2nd, it's obviously, childishly impractical. Most buildings can't just accommodate a new bathroom being added after the fact. So that's just off the table. And if you think just adding a specialized trans or non-binary stall to existing bathrooms like how handicap stalls exist, you don't understand the issue. The stall isn't where the problem comes from and, once again, puts a target on trans people's backs while not actually solving anything. It's a "solution" so cis people don't have to think about or understand the root of the issue.

Blatantly violated federal anti discrimination laws. When are people going to realize Republicans don't care whether a law is legal on a federal level or not? The absolutely vile cruelty is the point. They want members of the LGBTQ+ community dead.

A separate “other” stall is absolutely horrifying and dehumanizing. It’s like negotiating with a terrorist and “meeting in the middle” because BoTh SiDEs This literally solves nothing. It’s also completely nonsense that “well if you have a dick women will be uncomfortable” If you’re seeing anyones junk in the bathroom, you’re doing it wrong. If someone is going around the bathroom visibly showing their junk they need to be arrested regardless of gender or what bathroom they’re doing it in.
There literally only needs to be seven Republicans who side with the full Democratic voting bloc and those 218 (I'm not sure about the one Democrat who died before taking office) could elect the speaker. It's not 218 Republicans who get to elect the speaker, it's 218 total members of the house. It's always been you vote for your own party, but if a Republican has the guts to have the MAGA crowd against them - Democrats and centrists Republicans could pass legislation and wouldn't matter what the nutter MAGA people say.
2. Votes on bipartisan bills that have support across party lines (like a clean debt ceiling resolution) could be brought to the floor as there'd be no Hastert Rule in play.

>Bret: When people get on a bad path, whether it’s drinking or gambling or political or religious fanaticism, they tend to follow it all the way to the bottom, at which point they either die or have that proverbial moment of clarity. I’ve been waiting for Republicans to have a moment of clarity for a while now — after Joe Biden’s victory, or Jan. 6, the midterms, Trump’s dinner with Kanye West. I had a flicker of hope that the Kevin McCarthy debacle last week would open some eyes, but probably not. Part of the problem is that so many Republicans no longer get into politics to pass legislation. They do it to become celebrities. The more feverish they are, the better it sells.

Absolutely. And in this piece they completely refuse to accept any responsibility for their role in the fascist rise within the party. Yet they do still both say that the party has gone too far and deserves to be abandoned.
Imagine that you live in a bad neighbourhood. People keep robbing you and your neighbours keep buying the stolen stuff. This has been going on for ages. Then one day you buy some stuff at a suspiciously low price and one of your neighbours comes up to you and says, "That was stolen from me. If you're going to benefit from my suffering, least you could do was help pitch in so I can buy a new one!" You might be thinking, that that's not fair.
India's nationalism somehow surpasses even Turkish nationalism, I'm sure the Indian nationalists will respond rationally and logically and not with nationalist ideology.

4. When India will be much stronger in 2040-2050, they'll adjust their rethoric and start being anti-western, and because we are going to reach an important level of economic integration between the west and India as we did with China, our leaders are going to be faced with the same problem as the USA with China and Germany with Russia.

3. Opposition is even more suspicious of NATO than the current government and thus will only egg on Modi to support Russia.
The west, western media, and social media are painting far too rosy a picture of what's going on over there. Super glad we are sending serious tanks now, but it's many months late. We should have sent these at the beginning. It's ridiculous to think that Russia was going to let Ukraine win this with anything other than a complete and total military defeat. And that takes a lot.
Soledar is militarily insignificant. The West is looking for them to take take back strategic land in the south, not asking them to give up land just to give it up.

It almost sounds like he's describing a game of Command and Conquer. "All Ukraine needs to do is exploit that gap in their line with a tank rush and they're going to be set!".
I'm actually not quite sure how I came across that way, because I thought I didn't just make my point, but HAMMERED ON IT, but you got 5 upvotes, so it probably means that I wasn't clear in some way. Maybe the post was too long and it got skimmed -- apologies, I know I can be long-winded.

It's plain as day. The exceptions are not exceptions from appellate jurisdiction, making it original jurisdiction. The exceptions are from appellate jurisdiction to no jurisdiction. Original jurisdiction was already defined previously. If the drafters had meant it the way you're wrongly interpreting it, they'd have written the original jurisdiction portion to say so. Something like, "In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, those in which a State shall be Party, and any other areas Congress may deem necessary, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction." That would be an exception allowing for congressional discretion over original jurisdiction. But that's not what they wrote, is it?

Why would that matter? All that would change would be the name of the tyrant they try to prop up. The support so many of them showed for Trump even after he tried to send a bloodthirsty mob into Congress shows how utterly broken and despicable the Republican Party has become, and their longstanding habit of enacting anti-democratic voting policies wherever they get control shows that this isn't some isolated incident, it's the end goal.

That’s a great point. All these years standing there with my palms facing upwards saying, “this is crazy, right?” And then to see tens of millions cheering this madness on it’s all too easy to begin questioning reality. But yes, just total shitheads; exactly as it seemed.

Yep. Add to that: disdain for education, because they have never seen the difference quality education can make in your life. Hell, I had a hillbilly in law that couldn't understand why I would take a check from the insurance company for a car he was sure he could get running again (it had flooded). Like, having comprehensive coverage that actually paid me what the car was worth was just outside of his experience.

Exactly. And care for chronic conditions is even worse, and probably more important. Everything is handled through "the clinic" or your GP. And lots of people just don't get even that because they can't afford it, but they don't really understand that if they did get care, it would help. Like, they just dismiss the idea of seeing a PT as impossible (both because there aren't enough in the county and they can't afford it) but they also don't really believe it would help. The pain they are living with is seen as an immutable fact of life, part of growing old. Replace "PT" with "regular visits with endocrinologist for diabetes care" or "visits to the cardiologist to identify why walking across a parking lot is getting harder" or whatever and you get a bunch of people who see quality health care as like, non-essential.
One of the far right parties already talking about canceling trans healthcare (in Israel it is known as "The Committee") which is in charge of surgeries, hrt, and the change of the gender mark in trans folks ID. If they get their way and the committee gets out of the general universal healthcare or even demonized it can lead to a lot of problems for trans folks mostly because the general public just don't care enough about trans people here, they just think of them as part of the lgbt community and that's it.
Thank you. And no, I wouldn't get directly mad at my friend but I would carefully try to explain why a behaviour is leading to him getting bullied and therefore affecting me as well.

I also want to say that as a Jew it's important to remember that if you feel it's hard to be Jewish in America as a direct result of Israel's actions, then you blame should not be directed at Israel, but rather anti-semites who don't understand this dynamic and use "Anti-Zionism" as a flimsy cover to assert their antisemetic double standards on you and make you feel bad for being Jewish. Why should you be made to feel guilty about being a Jew? You didn't vote in the Israeli election. And also take a moment to understand that if you think everyone hates you because you're Jewish and American, try to imagine what it would be like as an Israeli and have countries much more powerful and populated than yours as your neighbours who would like to see you wiped off the map (I'm mainly referring to Iran). Now is the time to be proud to be Jewish. Not embarrassed or guilt-ridden.
The Justice Department signaled Friday it’s unlikely to share information about ongoing criminal investigations with the new GOP-controlled House, in a move that’s certain to frustrate Republicans in the chamber.

The some of his policies if I recall are ending the war on drugs, making immigration easier, and voting reform (such as ranked choice voting, which would have prevented the run off by doing an instant run off right there and then). His website goes more into detail though on other policies. I linked it above.
Why the libertarian national party doesn't just pick the one congressional district in America most favorable to them and get someone in Congress to carry their flag and actually propose legislation is beyond me.

Forcing the run-off was the whole goal. It’s to show that people are discontent with the 2 party system, because they are. More people are registered independent now than either democratic or Republican. Providing an alternative choice is what his campaign was about, and 81,000 people took that choice. If Warnock and Walker wanted to prevent a run-off so badly, than they should have been more caring about the voters who supported Oliver. Even now, Chase has offered a platform to Warnock and Walker to walk to his voters to try to win them over in the run-off, yet both Warnock and Walker haven’t even acknowledged it. They ignored a large amount of voters in the election, they deserved what came to them. I’m happy to see the establishment now waste millions of more of their dollars trying to fight over the seat.

Production with negative side effects (whether it's industrial fishing which decimates populations and dumps plastic, industrial farming which consumes oil and produces methane, or energy production which harmfully combusts a temporary resources) is the problem.

Looks like The Book Of Revelation to me. Everything from the mark of the beast to a new Jerusalem. The falling towers of Babylon and the 7 years of tribulation which we are currently in. 2020 to 2027. The Covid Years. The rising Dragon and Angels Trumpets. Cast ye into the Lake of fire if you are not chosen in the Book Of Life. The Antichrist will save the world and fool us all. That would be Artificial Intelligence...

I lost a home to a hurricane when I was a child. I was raised by just my mom. My lungs were shredded by black mold and didn't recover for years. We were donated a small camper while our new home was built. We relied on community and government, though more so on community, we only got $500 for immediate needs from the government. We had about a years supply of food stored up. We had a new home four months later. That's how my family rebuilt.

The law says that the required Saturday voting should float a week earlier if blocked by a holiday, but there is almost zero chance that any county would be ready at the end of this week since they have to close out the current election (including the audit), advertise the early voting dates and locations (at least 7 days in advance), and complete logic and accuracy testing of the equipment with the runoff ballot package (which also has to be advertised and public).

This isn't that uncommon. States can float holidays to celebrate at different times of the year to extend a break. You see it at universities also esp for the day after Thanksgiving and the week around Xmas or New Years. Should they be celebrating that particular holiday at all is questionable. But that's why they move holidays.

Just like Sarah Huckabee Sanders won the governorship of Arkansas, when she couldn't even handle the white house press corps, but her daddy's money and that magic (R) next to her name got her elected over someone who studied nuclear physics at MIT, and has a PhD in URBAN PLANNING. What could have been better for Arkansas?
He basically said the same about Trump after the attack on the Capitol, then reversed course soon after - not because he was presented with compelling evidence justifying the attack or confirming election fraud, but rather the realisation he would lose his Senate seat if he continued down that anti-Trump path. So why does anything this person says make news. He stands for nothing except himself.

"Exxon’s science was highly adept and the “projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models”". they use past tense, implying that the models used to be at least as skillful as others. had they used present tense, the implication would have been that they still are. the study itself, which is linked in the article, specifies "the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007.".
In exchange we largely ignore costly externalities such as mass extinction, loss of coast lines, more wildfire, stronger storms, bomb cyclones, an endometriosis epidemic and a generally unhappy population but yeah, we found the cheap fuel and ExxonMobil shareholders made a profit.

Yes? It's saying that Exxon's own scientists were skilled and knowledgeable and came to the same conclusions as other independent/government scientists, not that they were somehow more skilled and knowledgeable than modern scienctists.
Since 2017, Beijing has carried out a sweeping crackdown in the northwestern Xinjiang region under the banner of counterterrorism, undertaking campaigns to forcibly assimilate the mostly Muslim ethnic minority group. Experts estimate that Chinese authorities have detained more than 1 million Uyghurs as part of the crackdown, holding them in centers and reeducation camps and drawing international condemnation.

China consistently rejects these allegations. Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, claimed Thursday that “Xinjiang enjoys security, stability and a sound momentum of development. People there live a peaceful and happy life.”.
Oh, I don't disagree with you about student loan forgiveness (as I said, the arguments against it are pretty much disingenuous). I was just pointing out that the forgiveness was directly written into the law creating the PPP loans. Honestly, though, you could argue that forgiveness was written into the law regarding student loans. Even under the law as written in 1965, the Executive branch was given the power to waive or modify student loans however they wish. There really weren't any requirements regarding this. The Heroes Act then gave specific circumstances under which the loans could be waived or modified. It does not, however, say that those are the only circumstances where it can be done.

Congress cannot give away their constitutional responsibility over taxation or spending. You may be right on it should have been dismissed but it hasn't. I believe the SC is going to say that Biden overstepped but we will see.
Carrier Strike Groups are already extremely vulnerable to subalmarines both nuclear and conventional. Virtually every naval war game that has Subs versus Carriers. Ends up with the subs getting a kill. After the end of the Second World War. The allies had various captured German ships that had to be destroued afterna few years by treaty. As well as loads of surplus ships that could be destroyed. So the Americans started dropping nukes on them. The ships turned out to be far more resiliant than anybody expected. The problem was largely that the ships became radioactive. But if you expect to be attacked radiologically than you can "pre-wet" the ship. Essentially before, during and after the attack you have a load of high power sprinklers covering the entire outside of the ship. So the radiation doesn't stick to it.
From the article: "The Poseidon torpedo is a nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle" capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions. Its nuclear propulsion system gives the Poseidon virtually limitless range.".

Weed saved my life. I think a lot of people fuck about with it, but it isn’t like that hurts anyone. Make it illegal to drive high. Fire my ass if I’m at work high. But for Christ’s sake (who made weed for us if you’re Christian and believe God mad everything) let me smoke my goddamn weed on my own time. Mary’s cbd:thc patches are easily the best non-opioid pain relief I’ve had the pleasure of trying. Smoking before bed is one of the few ways, absent sleeping pills that make me walk, that let me have a solid quiet night of sleep without crazy dreams and sleep paralysis. Weed and therapy has saved me physically and mentally. Fuck D.A.R.E for trying to tell me this was an evil drug. Fuck anybody for trying to tell me this shit was immoral or unchristian or irresponsible. I’ve watched people fuck their lives up because of prescriptions. Weed has plenty of shit to educate people about, but it’s a far cry from dangerous.

They know they can't win this war in a neat and tidy way. It will either end with them losing and facing a shameful defeat with only losses to show for it, or they utterly devastate and overwhelm Ukraine and at least take the territory even if they nearly depopulate it.

There are no historical examples where the bombing of civilian targets has forced a country still capable of offering credible military resistance to surrender. None.

Anyway the point is that Russia's missile strategy is certainly a move, but for them to believe it was really the best use of their limited stockpile of missiles is to suggest that they still don't fundamentally understand the war that they are fighting or their position in that war. Taking out their electric grid is something you do against a military you are are already beating, and are just trying to expedite their surrender. Otherwise the best you can hope for is to slow the AFU down less than you could have if you targeted them directly.
To say all news travels at exactly the same speed is not true tho. News during the election cycle is always going to be much faster than news outside the election cycle. The current situation also cannot be viewed in a vacuum. While it took a while to get the documents back from Mar-a-Lago, the use of the FBI to seize the documents painted the issue in a vary public light. This will naturally charge the next instance of unreturned classified documents. While the general public may not have been as interested in the Trump document issue until the FBI showed up, that template would not translate over to the Biden document issue because people are now alerted to the potential danger of classified documents just lying around in a former president or vice president's private areas. Also, the Trump document fiasco happened just one month before.
Hahahahahaha. How many stashes are we up to with Biden? 3 maybe 4. Scattered all over the country. Even in closets next to his corvette. Top secret Documents on Ukraine This is huge! He wasn’t even president when he took them.

I guess? Except that the majority of biomass is plants, so it doesn’t seem so odd to separate out some things just to get a sense of scale. I mean, all statistics are really useless unless you’re trying to make some point about something. If you don’t care how much of x and y there is, a statistic is pointless. It’s really just sort of an eye opener - 96% of all mammalian “things” (by weight) on our planet are people and our food. It’s like saying 25% of all animal species on earth are types of beetles. Kind of cool but if you don’t care, then it’s a useless stat. I personally think it’s kinda crazy how successful beetles are but you might not.

Absolutely. A country would have to go in and wipe out the gangs, maintain law enforcement responsibility for decades to keep new ones from forming, pump a ton of money into the country to rebuild infrastructure, promote a stable system of government, improved education, work to root out corruption and the whole time the people that benefitted financially from the old system would be screaming bloody murder while eventually much of the domestic population would tire of your presence.

We just want peace and a stable country to share the border with. Haitians would hate it if Dominican troops were sent to their territory.
People have made a point to drop their membership (which was automatic at birth, prior) but I personally feel it has merit to, at the very least, retain my right to vote for church council - which isn't immune to political extremism. But that's an aside!
Just saying, although I can appreciate that asking a religious man to invoke religious words towards something that is against his religion is a somewhat more sensitive situation, the idea of "its his belief" is a dangerous path towards outright discrimination.

There are practical matters, such as keeping and caring for property and facilitating burial grounds, which still ties the church to law more so than other membership organisations (its purpose and form of organisation, for instance, are still regulated by law).

Lmao no. That's not what happened, at all. Business has a right to refuse service, but there's always an . The baker wasn't comf baking a cake for LGBT couple, it'd be like me not baking a cake for a black wedding because they're black. That actually illegal business discrimination.

They, or the church as a whole, simply are not under strict obligation to host wedding ceremonie for anyone, really. It's been a while since the church held dominion over the legal act of marriage and with separation between state and church largely complete, this is kind of a non-issue that primarily concerns members of the church.
So you're saying that Russia is doing the very thing they've accused Ukraine of? I'm shocked. They've never done that before. (\Said in the most monotone, un-shocked voice possible.).
Ukraine was also accused of hiding american biolabs that created viruses, owning infected pigeons and mosquitos that were trained to infect specifically russians, using small nuclear arms, satanism, terrorism attempts (that one time when russian police arrested "terrorists" who were carrying such dangerous stuff as ukrainian flags and Sims 2 disc) and etc.

Agreed. My point has never been about whether it's good or bad to use them though, more that I don't find Russia's word reliable enough to believe it was Ukraine using them. That's not to say Ukraine didn't, just that when Russia claims something it is often the case that Russia is trying to blame someone else for their own actions.

Hahaha. I smell manure. Ukraine destroyed their butterfly mines. Russia refused to sign the agreement to dispose of them and kept them, while Ukraine disposed more than 500k. No doubt Russia is using them in this instance, as earlier in the war. Russians are so full of bs these days that no one will trust a thing these granny raping poops say for the next 20 years. In the meantime, I will be looking for Poutin’s death notice on the front of the newspapers.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, shakes hands with commander of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine General Sergei Surovikin, awarded with order of Saint George of the Third Class, during visit to the headquarters of the Southern Military District, at an unknown location, Russia.
The issue with WMDs is MAD. Most people do not want to die. Most Russian politicians (including Putin) know that the moment they fire off a WMD the Kremlin will get levelled. We'll all get levelled. They want that just as little as you or I do.

Equally intolerable is Ukraine retaining control over the newly discovered oil and gas fields that can easily catapult them to the 2nd largest producer of either on the European continent right behind Russia, which means they could seriously undercut Russia's (and by extension Putin's) petrodollar profits, a fire threat given that Russian GDP is over 50% dependent on pil and especially gas exports.

The current leadership of Russia, and any Russian who continues to glorify them? Absolutely. If the government is replaced, though, treating the citizens as complicit will just drive the new government to resent the rest of the world, until it repeats the atrocities of the previous one. Even if it means allowing a small percent of sleazeballs to escape consequences by switching what side they claim to support in public, it'd be worthwhile to engineer a social environment that leaves the masses content with the new status quo. So I'd say, if their government gets properly replaced rather than just turned over to a new wave loyal to the ideals of the old, that everyone continues the hatred and vitriol but directed at "Putin's Russia", giving the new country an out. Don't ever let them forget that period of their past, but much like today's Germany is politically distinct from nazi Germany, those who choose not to behave like the old regime should be rewarded for their self-improvement, at least by sparing them some of the hatred so long as they control themselves.
Japan? No, never was, and people don't fucking care because everyone (aside China, but fuck China) moves past it instead of sitting and waiting an apology.
In the event that the current Russian government falls and sees some sort of return to democracy, freedom, and respect for neighbors, there will be a desire among some in the west to embrace this, to trust Russia, to expand trade with them and be friendly. But this already happened before and then Russia went back to the bad old days. And it can happen again. If Russia sees a change in leadership and a turn inward, the west mustn't get overly trusting - instead it should keep decoupling from the Russian economy, expanding NATO up to Russian borders as much as possible, and investing not in rebuilding Russia but in boosting the neighbors bordering Russia. If Russia still tolerates it, then a slow cautious thaw in relations can occur, and if Russia seethes with rage and quickly goes back to the bad old days again in response, well, the west will be more ready and more of Russia's neighbors will be defended by the NATO nuclear MADman umbrella.
A hypothetical. What happens when NATO gives all the weapons and Russia just takes over or Ukraine switches course?
Two fucking years before tRumps defeat a Wapo columnist foresaw everything; tRump sewing doubt, pressure on states not to confirm, the declarations that the election was rigged, then constitutional shenanigans to keep Trump in power until everything was resolved, which by that time he would be firmly ensconced as a fascist. Luckily, Mike Pence for once, as well as a couple of Republican secretaries of State,ii had some balls, but it was close, very close. And all these new laws as well as the gerrymandering will keep a white (soon to be) minority in power much longer than they should be. The poor and lower middle classes unfortunately take the economic beatdown via reduced safety nets and rigged tax rates, and that won't change until you marry that to those same people effectively losing any voice they thought they had in elections. It is a recipe for a revolt.

Wait, let's give credit to him for some of those other things: grifted millions of dollars from the US Government through his hotels and resorts, grifted millions of dollars from the American people directly by constantly campaigning instead of leading, aggressively/militaristically reacted to peaceful protests across the country causing several riots, encouraged paramilitary domestic terrorists to act more boldly, verifiably worked with foreign governments to funnel money into his personal wealth, worked with foreign governments in an attempt to undermine our elections, most likely traded our government secrets with other countries for personal gain, undermined our foreign policies and pulled us out of beneficial agreements for his own personal gain or for the gain of his allies in foreign countries (like Russia/Saudi Arabia/North Korea), did pretty much anything he could to restrict or limit our country's ability to respond to a global pandemic resulting in hundreds of thousands more deaths OF HIS OWN supporters than necessary, with the assistance of his supporters in Congress and the media he undermined the legitimacy of our elections, he pursued several avenues to steal the 2020 election and spread lies and misinformation for the months following the election, he then sparked an attempted coup on our nation's capitol which resulted in several deaths and may well lead to a second American Civil War.

I've not generally heard "wasting money on ineffective construction and implementing policy so cruel it was probably a violation of international law" referred to as "getting control", but I guess we have different definitions.

Did he? Seems like he made a "manageable problem" into a "humanitarian disaster" and then he wasted a FUCK TON of money on a wall that was cheaply built and funneled cash into the pockets of the likes of Steve Bannon. He also started a "light genocide" of legal asylum seekers by separating parents from their children and "housing" them in basically human kennels allowing many of them to die from disease and starvation. We have different definitions of "control.".

Yeah I’ve heard, and it’s definitely no coincidence that eggs are a stand out in price increases due to that, but it’s not the only skyrocketing staple food. Like I said, idk how big of a part of the problem this is, and no matter what the answer to that is in reality, it’s an exasperation of a wider lack of oversight. I personally think that grocers and healthcare should not be allowed to be a for profit businesses. People have to eat, so we either end up subsidizing the population and having our tax dollars go to the grocers, or we subsidize production and our tax dollars go to private mega farms. I don’t have a good answer for how to fix that. But the reason I see this being an issue with food especially is the demand for food as a general category can not drop. With these pricing systems that turns into a form of tacit price fixing. I’ve been hearing that Trader Joe’s, sprouts, and Whole Foods all have eggs in at reasonable prices. The official reason is that they use different suppliers, but I think this type of pricing model contributes to it. They haven’t seen increased sales on those at those stores because they all cater to the upper middle class, those folks don’t start eating more eggs and beans when the water is looking choppy. I also don’t see much conversation at all about Kroger buying out a bunch of other brands when people who are being realistic are acknowledging there are more food shortages ahead. That should be raising alarm bells.

In New York old line Democrats who depended on support from police unions, etc., lost their seats. Democrats who want to win have to offer a vision that's worth fighting for — a "just transition" that invests in an economy that actually provides what we need, like affordable housing, education, transportation, and healthcare, and lets people make lifestyle choices without getting banned or jailed.
Same. I’m an elder millennial that loathes so much of the nonsense our generation does. I can’t tell you how many of my friends and colleagues sat out 2016 because “both candidates were bad.” I’m so sorry for our fuck up that led to Trump, but keep up the good fight Gen Z, and keep showing my dumbass generation how it’s done. Your anger is very much appreciated. Bravo!

I can’t tell you how many of my friends and colleagues sat out 2016 because “both candidates were bad.” I’m so sorry for our fuck up that led to Trump, but keep up the good fight Gen Z, and keep showing my dumbass generation how it’s done. Your anger is very much appreciated. Bravo!

she’ll win. vegas voted for her, and we’re just waiting for those results, mostly. my little podunk, mostly red and rural state has extremely concentrated liberal cities (reno/sparks and vegas/henderson). as for the governor’s race, everyone here is super critical of sisolak because of how the conservatives have driven home the message of how “badly” he handled the pandemic. he did what he could with what he was given (which was bullcrap help from an inept federal “leader” of orange persuasion). i guess it’s “let’s try something new” time, and the state will soon find out how corrupt joe lombardo is.

OK? But my original reply was pointing out that there will be a much larger market in programming the communications constellations than in the cleanup satellites. Not really referencing the original article.

They plan on tweeting Musk with an offer of a million Chinabucks so he will pretend his satellites are suppressed. Much cheaper than launching satellites of a technologically sophisticated level such that they’ll need to buy them from the U.S.
The bill was incredibly unpopular in Scotland and considering devolution never gave the Scottish Government the power to to so this in the first place it's obvious to a blind man that Sturgeon wanted this to happen so she could have her little showdown with Westminster.
Aside from the fact that the bill is extremely unpopular with the electorate which was shown by repeated polls and section 35 being written into the Scotland Act meaning it is part of devolution there is nothing in the bill that safeguards the people most affected by it, Women.

Incorrect. The reforms pertain to healthcare and state record-keeping, which are entirely devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The reforms passed by 2/3 of Members of the Scottish Parliament, voted in by members from all political parties in the Parliament, including Conservatives.

Im not lying at all. Ofcourse it bloody passed with majority parliamentary support, that's literally how bills pass. My point was that it was incredibly unpopular with the electorate. Which every single poll conducted since shows it is.
Some nearby marshland has acted as a refugia for the local oyster population - there are small clusters that still exist thanks to duck hunters buying up and protecting marshland in the 1900s. So to seed new oyster reefs out on the sandbars and banks, they are taking advantage of the natural ability for oyster larvae to attach to oyster shells, by collecting and bundling spent oyster shells from restaurants and laying them down as a natural holdfast on which oyster larvae can grow. The process is called .
Among the nuclear armed nations, Russia is involved in a war and has a first-use doctrine of using both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons; China is increasingly threatening towards Taiwan and is clashing more with the US than ever; North Korea is developing new delivery systems that is threatening and destabilizing a region; and, not too long ago, there was an actual war between India and Pakistan - two avowed nuclear powers.

I fully agree. I so wish more people knew about the amazing things we’re rolling out even just in the renewable energy sector.
This is the single reason neither Lukashenko or Putin have pushed the button on a second front opened by Belarus yet, because they'd have to divert a ton of Russian forces to enforce Belarus' military participation and fight partisans behind the lines.
Southam leaves 5.6 million. 2.75 are women. Sooo, is he going to take 60% of the male population between 15 and 65 into the military?

His military force is only about 50,00, with some weird paramilitary of about 150,00. Scary, depending on their mood, no?.

So here's a thing, neither Russia nor Belarus nor Ukraine have entered full mobilization yet, but if Belarus and Russia do enter full mobilization, if they do mobilize millions of soldiers, we could potentially be looking at 10 to 1 or larger numerical advantage for Russia. I know that some EU countries (mine included) are making list of all Ukrainian men and boys who escaped Ukraine, in case of full mobilization. They are literally making list of boys age 16 and up for potential conscription.

Not necessarily. The Russian (and by extension, Belarusian) way of war has a different set of rules. They only have to give guns to the blocking troops. Prisoners are useful as meat shields and bio-mine detectors.
Only difference is, at the end, they won't be looking at their inventory going: "Huh, I was able to get through this just fine without having to waste it.".
Russia is a poor and corrupt country and definitely cannot afford to produce a meaningful amount of modern vehicles, but it is not very hard to design and build a tank that is better than a Abrams or Leopard 2 in many ways if you have a tank industry, a pile of cash and can start from a clean slate instead of dealing with the constraints of design decisions made before you were born.

>The Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments is an independent, non-partisan body established by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to provide merit-based recommendations on nominations to the Senate of Canada. The body was established in an attempt to end partisanship in Senate appointments. Individuals wishing to be appointed to the Senate may submit an application to the board for consideration. The board was established on January 19, 2016 and is made up of three permanent federal members and two members from each of the provinces or territories where a vacancy is to be filled‍.[1] On January 19, 2016, the names of the members of the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments were announced. The chair is former deputy minister Huguette Labelle. There are two other federal members: Ms. Melissa Blake from Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Honourable Francois Rolland from Montreal. Two provincial or territorial members are also appointed to represent provinces and territories with current or anticipated vacancies in the Senate. This board makes up a short list of candidates to be considered for Senate vacancies, based on merit instead of partisan politics.[2] However, the slate of recommended candidates is not binding on the Prime Minister who will make the final decision as to who is recommended to the Governor General for appointment.[3][1]Since the process was established in 2016, all 60 appointments (as of July 2021) were made from recommendations provided by this Board.
Guaranteed? Let's say your company has 1000 workers. The possibility for you having one of them selected is: 43.24%... every one hundred years! Or 2.89% every election. So now you want to tell me that a company of 1000 people can't work with such odds? Really play a bit with the numbers and you will see this is a non-issue...

The Department of Human Services would administer the People’s Housing Assistance Fund Demonstration Program, which would provide 12 monthly $1,000 payments to individuals who met the following criteria: experiencing homelessness, at risk of homelessness, severely rent burdened, or earning at or below 60% of area median income.

Have you ever dealt with someone who’s addicted? I’d argue a very large majority of these folks will absolutely spend the $ on drugs or alcohol. What these people need is detox, treatment, rehab, and counseling. If they can prove they are clean then I’m all for helping them get back on their feet. But as soon as they start using again, yank the $. I bet 10% at best will use this money to actually try and improve their lives. Addiction is hell, I’d know because that was me. Cheers.

Edit: his first two administrations "was marked by the consolidation of social programs like Bolsa Família and Fome Zero, leading Brazil to leave the UN's Hunger Map.[9] During his two terms in office, he undertook radical reforms, leading to growth in GDP, a reduction in public debt and inflation, and helping 20 million Brazilians escape poverty.[10] Poverty, inequality, illiteracy, unemployment, infant mortality, and child labor rates fell significantly, while the minimum wage and average income increased, and access to school, university, and health care were expanded.".

This is not true at all. Most of Lula's ministers are political appointees. To be clear: I voted for Lula, and having ministers by chosen by politics is fairly common here, and important to make sure that Lula can govern with support from Congress. But let's not pretend like all ministers are there because of merit. Haddad, Alckmin, Renan Filho, Tebet and the ministers from União Brasil for example... they are there because of politics. Not because they are the best choices.
The folks who don’t work in service need to understand how this would actually play out in practice. I work in a tasting room with about the same seating capacity as this restaurant. We have the option to collect payment info when we take reservations, and thus the option to charge no-shows, but it happens at our discretion. Slow Wednesday and a party of two doesn’t show up? Fine, Godspeed, you haven’t actually inconvenienced us. But a group of 8 no-shows on a Saturday? You bet your ass I’m charging you; I’ve had to turn away walk-ins because you agreed to show up at a time and now you’ve cost me that business. It can be a very case-by-case decision, and nobody should be condemning this restaurant for putting a system in place that allows them to recoup some losses.
Exactly. Scarcity isn’t conducive to calm. A restaurant controls the atmosphere just like they do the menu. It’s a huge part of the overall experience.

Once the chargeback is filed the merchant has a chance to respond and then the cardholder/issuer can respond back if the merchant did not accept it at which point the merchant has one last chance to accept it before it is sent to the credit card network for a final binding arbitration(the number of steps can vary by network but that's the general gist). There are significant fees incurred on both sides to end up doing this so the overwhelming majority of disputes are resolved before this.

Wow. Did George ever live in WI? Many years ago I was in the drive thru at a McDonald's in Wisconsin and a young Hispanic worker greeted me at the window with the question, "Do you watch Nickelodeon?" and "Do your kids watch it?". I was puzzled and said yes and he proceeded to tell me he was in Hanna Montana and rambled on basically saying the same thing and telling me how to watch him. My kids and I just thought he was special needs maybe, because the staff just sort of ignored him holding up the line to discuss it. It was a really awkward encounter. How weird would it be if it was him?

Probably ritualistically shaved his testicles. There’s nothing like a shorn scrotum, it’s quite breathtaking.
Boomers will never get it. They were gifted a country that was in the perfect state for them to excel and have the best quality of life this country has ever seen and think it was all their doing. Gen-Z is realizing they are going to be part of the modern slave generation and on top of it deal with climate disasters the boomers can't even fathom because they'll all be dead soon anyway, and as the most diverse generation the country has ever had have less freedom while under Christofascist rule. For the next 50 or 60 years of their lives. Republicans know their s\it is not popular, and while boomers are stupid enough to fall for the culture war BS, younger generations do not because they aren't all glued to the Fox News nightly grand slam of Ingraham, Hannity, Tucker, and Gutfield pumping them full of hard right propaganda as they drift off to sleep that would make Putin jealous.
But... If we lose the house, that's a huge loss. I agree dems are doing better than historically expected. But R's in control of the house turns the government into a massive clown show and absolutely nothing gets done. Even a 1 seat majority for the R's is too much.

2. They say there will be no more mobilization, but the previous mobilization never ended and could just be picked back up allowing them to have a second mobilization wave without having to legally declare a second one while many high ranking local officials have asked they end the first wave and they have refused.
Most likely it will happen. Major russian social sites and forums just today had 2 types of news - Putin/Peskov saying that mobilization will not happen again (even as it is officially not even ended yet, so it can just be resumed, instead of started again) and posts about how those who left the country are traitors/cowards/losers. But that begs the question, if mobilization will not resume, why so many efforts to discourage more people from leaving the country specifically now? And yes, many people report that they were told to visit military organizations in January, just to "make data in databases more precize". When one guy sent his wife with all documents, and she said that every data needed is there, so no reason for husband to personally come later, they just dismissed her.
I could have told you that the vast majority of BS and lies that gets passed around in the US is through word of mouth. The right wing media puts out messages that are designed to get people to talk about them and the people who listen usually trust the person they are talking. If you are not aware of what is going on, it's very easy to fall victim to it.
Companies don’t go out and hire unqualified underrepresented minorities to fill diversity quotas. They change their recruiting practices to actively seek qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds. Not having a team solely made up of type-A, 30-something white dudes is honestly a smart hiring strategy.

It’s also federally illegal. I wish they’d start withholding federal funds to the asshole run states when they pass laws obviously illegal at the federal level. That’s how they got the drinking age raised to 21 everywhere was basically withholding federal transportation funding.
Larkin called a private emergency executive meeting to discuss “unelected personnel”. The city council then voted out Zimmerman (the sitting mayor), which moved Sarah Leland, the vice-mayor, up to the mayor position… which she immediately relinquished and nominated Larkin to be mayor since she had no vice-mayor to take her role… which the council then approved… effectively ousting Zimmerman and replacing him with Larkin through a series of council votes.
Yup! Every family of mine who claimed to be a libertarian was just a Republican who thought the Iraq war was a bad idea (in hindsight of course - they gleefully supported it for all of Bush’s term) but still voted straight ticket Republican in every election.

Ukraine has reason to let it live for now. Let it live until they push into Crimea so the Russians have a way out. Sure it means the troops can be used to re-enforce Russian lines elsewhere but you generally dont want to leave an enemy no escape route unless your plan is to literally eliminate them.
Huh! That’s interesting. I’ll keep that in mind. I live in Alaska so we don’t have fleas but I’m finishing a project in Idaho and they are down here. I’m not wanting to import any back home. I’ve heard if you get them into your house they can take up residence. That’d be such a bummer. Ditto with picking up bed bugs while traveling. Thanks for the tip.

By not hitting Russia proper, Ukraine proves to the Russian population that they aren’t as barbaric as the Russian government makes them out to be, completely invalidating the majority of Russian propaganda. Making Russians doubt their government and their actions. They can keep Russian war support low, making the Russian people unwilling to cooperate with their government when it comes to the war and makes soldiers more unwilling to fight, meaning they’ll surrender to Ukrainian forces with less of a fight.

How? Ukraine lacks a navy and has very little air power. Russians have dug in deep in Crimea since 2014 and can be resupplied by rail, sea and air. I cannot imagine Ukraine taking back Crimea by military force, it simply lacks the capacity to do so. Ukraine may be able to take back all the rest of the Russian occupied areas, but Crimea would be a meat grinder for them and Russia will not give it up and will just commit it's entire military to keeping it if it has to. It will only be handed back to Ukraine under diplomatic means IMO.
We've already failed. A lying, traitorous, racist, wannabe dictator made it into the highest office for four years. He installed a majority on the supreme court and stacked many other positions with under-qualified, immoral loyalists. The most watched news station in the country became the front arm of an ongoing, nation-wide disinformation campaign which couldn't be any more anti-american if it were run by Putin himself. Also complicit were (almost) all members of Republican leadership, and some of the wealthiest people (and maybe countries) in the world. They attempted a multi-layered self-coup, and the guy calling for termination of articles in the constitution while having dinner with anti-Semites is still the leader of the party.
Oh God no. Did we learn nothing from 2016? Many people, including me, were just certain that Clinton would crush Trump. How could anyone vote for that buffoon, we thought.

The Fairness Doctrine was able to exist for so long because it was very difficult to enforce, and thus it was hardly enforced, and it was an agreement to which broadcasters had to abide because the radio airwaves (and this includes tv which also used bands of the radio spectrum - I have a radio that could pick up the audio from my local tv stations) were seen a publicly-owned utility to be administered by the FCC. You want a broadcasting license? You had to abide by the FCC. That's out now. This is also why there was never a Fairness Doctrine for print.

Not to say you’re wrong for feeling that way, but that sentiment is exactly what both the Republican Party and certain foreign governments want you to feel. They want people so disgusted that they want to throw the baby out with the bath water. They want you to lay the blame for the disfunction, inaction and disruption at the feet of our entire governmental apparatus in particular, American democracy in general, and all our politicians equally, no matter how aligned they are with your interests or how effective their lawmaking or policies. They want you to look uncritically at the whole mess and ignore the people/organizations that are directly responsible for both the chaos, and the narrative that the chaos is everyone else’s fault and unavoidable. It’s an been an incredibly effective approach to derailing this country, tapping into our most deep-seated societal fears and (so-far) repressed fascistic tendencies. Characteristics that have long been sidelined and papered-over by polite society, aspirational ideals and moderate voices who understand the necessity of governing. What’s replaced it is orchestrated disenfranchisement, manufactured outrage, and political nihilism. These people want to fiddle while Rome burns, but have zero appreciation for, or understanding of, what the world will look like when it does (except the Russians, they’d probably be cool with it in the end).
Interesting. I didn't think that the 20(well there are only 6 holdouts now) had any connection beyond a desire to get as much as they could out of McCarthy. What makes you think that they've got connections with Russia?

why do I say that? I'm a Type 1 diabetic adult, but I've read far too many stories of CHILDREN dying because their parents refuse to inject insulin (with the same asinine reasoning the anti-vaxxers did for Covid) and pray to Jesus while their children are eaten alive by ketoacidosis. It enrages me more than any other thing on this planet.

I was only 20yo at the time. Years later I remembered how she made kid-me carry a No Blood card in my wallet, especially when she knew I was going into possibly dangerous situations. My mother would've let her only child die for a stupid cult that knocked on her door and smiled when she was socially isolated and vulnerable.

so you can bet that despite how ridiculous it sounds, there are lots and lots of Russians that believe that there is a Jewish man who is head of state in Ukrane that is also simultaneously a Nazi, and that they are in fact in a war with NATO.
And, despite the fact that NATO forces are not actively in the war, the mere fact of supplying arms, support, and sanctions to support a Nazi regime is further proof of how its Russia against the evil of the world and is in a war with NATO.

Big time. Two of our largest industries are Defense and Energy. All of Europe is now buying American gas instead of Russian, and we are selling weapons like hot cakes, not just to Ukraine, but to many panicked nations in neighboring regions. And that’s just the financial side. Our sphere of influence, our soft power, and our ability to project it has grow exponentially in the region as well. Not to mention Ukraine is slowly whittling away at one of our primary adversaries for pennies on the dollar compared to a direct American involvement in the war. This has been a great win after 4 years of Trump ruining relationships with our allies. A great win for democracy. A great win for NATO as a collective. I’d like to believe that by setting this interventionist precedent, we have also deterred other rivals from their nefarious pursuits cough China and Taiwan cough. With luck, Putin dies, we see pro Western regime change, and can begin discussing on the nuclear disarmament of Russia as a condition to be reintegrated into the global economy. Hats off to the Biden Administration on this one for a job well done.
Really? Russia has been in Ukraine almost a year, and victory is still uncertain. Throw 15-20 more countries at them and I don’t see Russia having a chance.(assuming they don’t go nuclear).
I remember in high school being absolutely astounded that there were beautiful old cathedrals and bell towers and Colliseum in Italy that were graffitied and carved all over with names, and that people could just climb on Roman ruins in parks - then it kinda clicked that the locals mostly viewed it as “boring old buildings or rubble” unless they could make some $ from tourists.
That’s it. It doesn’t matter how fucked up Egypt is, people want to see the pyramids. We learn about them in school, and they’re a constant source of curiosity. They’re one of those things that ends up on a lot of bucket lists. People are going to see the pyramids no matter what’s going on.

You can see pyramids, not the pyramids. Mexican pyramids are cool, but Egyptian pyramids are what’s in everyone’s mind when they think pyramid. We saw them history books, movies, video games, etc. They’re probably the most iconic historical location in the world. There will always been an attraction towards ancient Egypt and the pyramids.
My comments are just saying that we haven't learned our lessons. If Russia collapses, it won't be rebuilt if they start behaving. It will just get worse. The point on the cause of WWII being the poverty in Germany as the aftermath of WWI should be a giant red flag in this situation now. We are entering a very similar situation with a decent amount of encouragement to give them what they deserve. The lessons have not been learned. In fact instead if there is war or domestic instability, then the international world will pull that country apart while taking sides to fund and support, allowing more internal unrest. Take Sadia Arabia's civil war as my giant example of how internationally we've not learned anything. Nor will act in a way to invest in another country's well being if we still see them as a threat.
Unlikely. North Korea is dirt poor and if anymore countries stop buying anymore stuff from them, the famine will be even worse and yet still they remain yo be slave to a fat manchild.
I remember as a kid growing up in Toronto the dangers I faced just walking to school. It was 2 miles (3.21 K) uphill and there was always the risk of a moose attack. There was also the risk of wolves and you were completely defenseless with the snowshoes, which we wore year round. Ever wonder why visiting Canadians will take their shoes off at the door? You gonna wear your snowshoes indoors?
Ambassador warns: "Very addicting substance known as Tim Hortons has resulted in unprecedent epidemic sweeping across the country" and warns "they're even disrespectfully covering the chip portion of the Russian invented fish and chips with cheese curds and gravy" while "using deceptive politeness and genuinely explaining they are sorry even when it probably wasn't their fault in the first place".

Every school day the class size dwindled. "What happened to Sally?" "Wolves got her walking home." "What happened to Billy?" "Bit by a rabid beaver." It's a tough life when your schoolbooks are constantly pecked by the millions of Canada Goose.
It's not that they're that stupid. It is that they are that easily misled, lean into confirmation biases, and their ideological bent requires loyalty to the leader. When a lot of their copium was starting to run out, they turned on one of their fellow Trump supporters and accused him of being an FBI operative leading conservatives into a Honeypot. Ray apps had to go into hiding because of the death threats from MAGAdittoheads and they are still floating the conspiracy theory and asking (bad faith JAQing off) why he isn't in jail wow good old-fashioned Christian homeschooling Patriots are rotting away under house arrest. The leaders of the conservative movement are not stupid but they do play into the confirmation biases other intended audience and use that audience distract conversation the same as they always have. This is the problem when people confuse shock shock comedians do the 3-hour set every weekday for actual news.

The other head of state is Macron. Andorra is fairly interesting from a sovereignty standpoint. And theirs a lot of weird religious shit that's survived into the modern day. One of the modern incarnations of the knights hospitaller has its own diplomacy corps and official observer status at the UN. Despite the fact that it hasn't been a sovereign nation since 1815. I've got no idea how they pulled that one off.

It’s just bots. There’s a lot of progressive activists who are tech literate and can get on github and download Reddit bot scripts and deploy them. Do many people really care about what Andorra does about anything? Not really, so the message needs amplification.
Over 3 million voters in Florida voted for democratic candidates in 2022. We need more from the national party. I’d like to encourage the national democratic party to bring forth more goals than abortion access. It is embarrassing. Support medical procedures people decide in private and move on. Let’s finally do the right thing and expand representation in the House. Taxation without representation is what we fought for to create this nation. Let’s give the citizens of DC, USVI, PR, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana’s a full vote in the House. Let’s work with our South and Central American and Caribbean neighbors to figure out how to help them create opportunity and security to keep their residents in their nations to stave the migration patterns to the USA. Let’s end our embargo with Cuba. Marco Rubio is obviously going to be re-elected, let’s go for it. Let Florida turn red over Cuba. It is already red. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain. Let’s also talk more about the high cost of health care and how unfortunate it is for small business that they have to provide it for full time employees. Wouldn’t it be freeing for small business owners to not have to pay for it when a federal system already exists and could be expanded? These are things that make sense at a national level.
Extreme gerrymandering. They redrew my district and added a few to the state in areas they knew they could pick up easy wins. The maps were literally drawn by the governor :
In other circumstances, people like to talk about donor countries. This difference to the receiving countries leads to a break. This is happening now.
This includes associating Soviets with modern Russia, UN votes, vetos and speeches, arms sales, seeing Russia as a successful and honest country, and being completely forgiving of all and any Russian steps against Indian interests (big one is their massive relationship with China, but also them restricting foreign investment from India and others and cancelling arms sales).

They do not. There's respect for the fact that Russia has been more reliable over the decades, but no one is in love with the country. People do not go about discussing Russia, what a great country they are, consuming their media etc. Heck, no one ever even thinks about them and their cultural exports to India are basically nonexistent. I'm from India, so I think I have a pretty good idea of how people feel about this. Again, it's not about the love for Russia, it's more about skepticism of the west due to past actions and what is seen as condescending attitudes of the west.
I suffer from a mental illness, and not one of the more 'media friendly' mental health diagnoses such as depression or anxiety. I'm well treated for it (schizoaffective disorder), as you can hopefully tell from my relative coherence. I'm posting this article partially because of an interaction I had the other day in this subreddit, wherein a commenter joked that C-SPAN callers were undiagnosed schizophrenics, and I was downvoted for asking them not to make a punchline out of the illness. I'm sharing this article and this story to hopefully help humanize those with even the less savory mental health issues, and maybe give someone pause before the next time they joke about "schizos", call Fetterman a 'vegetable', rush to attribute violence to mental health issues, or in some other way do their part to ensure that those with serious mental health issues and/or disabilities do not take part in public life.

Interesting perspectives. Without being too insensitive to the challenge Fetterman is facing, one wonders whether there are some national security considerations worth examining as it pertains to politicians suffering mental illness. I think we’ve got enough issues with how our leaders perceive reality even without taking mental illness into consideration.

To finish, it seems appropriate to reflect on the topic of this particular article; despite knowing that there were credible reports stating that issuing these bullshit notices to vulnerable people was harming them, not to mention illegal, she herself formulated the media crisis strategy, which involved publishing broadly the names and details of people who disputed the notices in the media to deter anyone else from coming forward.

Thanks. It still just blows my mind that even governmental records weren't considered good enough in terms of proof. I realise it was a federal policy and I worked for the state government, but if even governmental records weren't considered good enough what chance did most people have of being able to gather sufficient proof. I realise it's just more bad faith on top of bad faith, but it was absolutely set up so that people had no chance.

I've done disaster work and there's always uneven focus given to people and recovery of certain areas, most of the DSA (disaster survivor assistance, think door to door registration for assistance) I saw and took part in was targeted towards wealthier neighborhoods, and when we did low income neighborhoods people had less time to work on actually getting everything together, filling out the paperwork or following up and less attention over all was given to them. Although I am surprised the owners of the multi million dollar houses weren't offered SBA loans, which were low interest loans offered instead of grant money to people who made above a certain threshold. Maybe the SBA program is newer than 2012, but it's still surprising they got the grants.

The people are broken into submission and resigned to their fate. Many know they won't live long enough to collect their pension so they drink their lives away. Yet there are some who gladly want Putin to restore the Soviet Union as they desire a return to when their lives were a little better. There are also people who believe all the propaganda from the Kremlin.
There are people who have taken the pro-Putin propaganda to heart and really ran with it. They may be members of nationalistic groups online.

Getting back to those ultra nationalistic groups online. They are kind of like American QAnon believers in the sense that they've swallowed the Kremlin propaganda whole and are really nationalistic. Some of them will settle for nothing less than the total conquest and destruction of Ukraine and the Ukrainians. Some actually are baying for their blood.

Exactly. Navalny was poisoned, recovered, decided to return to Russia and now is suffering daily inhumane treatment in prison. What for? Wouldn't he be able to do much more good if he stayed free and abroad?
Imagine a version that is unbound and unrestricted in terms of access to data and ways to gather more of it. Running on hardware that is 10-100 times more powerful to boot.
I wonder if it has anything to do with politicians actively targeting specific groups or the Guardian and BBC giving breathless coverage to the most wretched voices available or the promotion of its most famous author who actively campaigns against trans people until her PR team tells her to stop cause a kid got murdered.

This argument does not swing in YOUR favor. It swings in the pro-trans direction. So it’s funny that you’re making it, thinking it adds to your point. You shot yourself in the foot with this one.

It might be that fighting these idiots, the primary "weapon" is to show that the "Christian" conservatives aren't Christian, and that the military conservatives no longer follow conservative principles (how is it "small government / best government is that which does the least" to have a jihad against people who don't fit into white cishet norms?). Pointing out that some of their talking points are from Moscow is helpful to show that these people are dangerous, but doing the first two things is "enough" .. or should be... should have been if done earlier.

Digitize everything. People should be able to pull up records without going through ridiculous forms and filings only to be rejected for no good reason. Every vote by a politician, every line of every draft of a bill, every word uttered on the debate floor, every outcome of a committee discussion, all of it there for anyone who would have it. (except in cases of national security and even then there's a timeframe for release). There should never be any voice vote or raising of hands where you can't tell exactly what your elected officials voted for. Total transparency in that regard.
Companies aren't people they neither have friends nor interests. Nestle is made of individuals who have friends, needs, and all the fallability of any other human being. However under the cloak of a massive multi-national company individuals can freely exploit whatever they want with near immunity/anonymity and people will never know who they are or hold them accountable because everyone believes it was the company doing it all along and the governments of the world helped them do it.

You just lost your job. Your wife needs insulin. Your kid is starving. Are you going to turn up your nose at a custodial job paying minimum wage for 10-20 hours a week? Do you think the employer cares about your circumstance? Likely, they'll just use that info to give you the shifts they can't get others to cover.

And like a child who indiscriminately rejects anything that might challenge what they believe in or what argument they're trying to make, these conservatives blindly disregard and dismiss all information that threatens their worldview, their argument or narrative, while on the other hand, they gravitate towards and mindlessly embrace whatever information confirms their biases, their pre-conceived views and their prejudices.

RIP USA. There are no more elections in the US. The political machine now has direct control over the population. This is precedent that we be followed in other states. Mail in votes will never be removed (even though it was unconstitutional in PA). And elections will never be secured. We cannot even secure voter id laws. Don't get me wrong, I will be voting Trump, but watch the enormous fraud take place and everybody says, "this is fine."".

Every time, every god damn time we see right wing violence, it's turned into a conspiracy of some sort, or it's downplayed, whitewashed, like these people are fucking blameless, perfect, incapable of wrongdoing, which is an egregiously absurd notion, it also helps them lay the blame on others, and again, this is exactly how a child behaves/thinks.

What's more, whenever an act of political violence occurs, and it's some right wing nutjob behind it, or some mentally unstable person who has been radicalized by far right ideals, conspiracies and propaganda, it's almost always either a false flag, a cover up, or some deeper conspiracy. How convenient right? The party of personal responsibility can't seem to... Take responsibility.

If only people voting for the GOP actually saw how these priorities actually help them, it would be amazing. (Mainly because I want the Overton window to shift so we are more on par with other first world countries.).
A few years ago (2013-2014 I believe) a real life socio-political experiment began when Wisconsin went decidedly GOP under Scott Walker and his gerrymandered kabal in the legislature the same year Minnesota went decidedly Democratic with Dayton and bicameral Dem legislatures. Similar sizes, similar economic engines, similar climate -- side by side.

Edit: gerrymandering is legal under the constitution. Just can’t do it based on race etc. if the GOP gerrymanders, the Democrats must also do it, or they will be unable to represent their constituents in an effective manner. This is how you end up with a democratic governor who is essentially worthless when a GOP veto proof legislative body controls a state. Reference NC as an example.
Oh I'm not saying marijuana doesn't have a place in medical treatment of numerous different conditions. I cannot think of any legitimate medical reason you would light it on fire and smoke it, and therefore, it's silly for people to pretend the zip they picked up to spin into a backwood is part of a legitimate medical treatment plan...
I firmly believe that in the not so distant future there's going to be evidence that comes out, unshocking to anybody who's not a moron, that lighting marijuana on fire causes sickness like lung cancer... Because lighting anything on fire and breathing the smoke does.

Seriously. I’ve often considered the types of selfish justifications politicians could make for legalization, beyond anything monetary, and one of the most obvious to me is pacification of an increasingly disgruntled populace. A closely associated line of reasoning, what you describe, would be legalization to offer a more comfortable condition of experience while we’re subjected to the impacts of their perpetual corruption. Put another way, if you’re going to f us, at least use lube.

mmmmmmmmmmmmm idk. I think that was put in place to sew distrust in the election process in general. Regardless of how insane the claim is it is a conditioning tactic for his base. If they believe that, how could they even stomach losing an election? Trump is a non-sensical asshat but this may have been something he did purposefully.

That’s actually insane, speaking probability-wise and disregarding politics. I bet the republicans who didn’t vote are feeling pretty stupid and the democrats who did pretty awesome.
OOO, I'm waiting to turn negative points, for a comment on the same topic in r/Europe. The issue is not only in the dumb wind turbines but in general the Sami community as a whole will be abused. I'm not Norwegian but I live in a village where there are Sami, and as far as I know in the past the Norwegians didn't treat them well. Territories have been taken away for NATO training grounds, or for industry in Sweden and Norway, I guess the argument for industry is the same as now for "eco-activities". In the 80s, the constitution of Norway was written, I think, that the state should guarantee the preservation and development of the Sami way of life, and not work more because of the money generators that interfere with the reindeer herds.
What a shameful response. This take isn't just misguided and dumb, it's straight up evil. The obvious fix is to put the wind farms somewhere else so as not to interfere with indigenous lifeways. This should have been a basic part of the due diligence done during the planning process.
So the software dev field is a bit complicated here, but to generalize it, the more credentials or higher skill the job is the more insulated it is from market effects. It's why the ice cream shop down the street is offering almost 80 percent more than it was 2 years ago but software devs are probably seeing something like a 10 to 20 percent increase (I'm speculating,) but that pressure still exists. At some point there's a potential software dev that stays working IT, a potential IT guy who stays working doing computer repair, and a computer repair guy who stays working at the ice cream shop because of the upward pressure of the wages from the bottom, so it also creates a shortage at the top.
1. I know 6 people who don't have jobs all 6 have said that they aren't willing to work for minimum wage. All 6 have a significant other that works. Money is tight but not that tight.

Oh and I'm getting tired of western countries playing the immigration card for damn near everything - there are certainly benefits but instead of investing in training, education, and paying more so the nation's population can fill the gaps at living wages, many western countries just poach talent for (relatively) cheap labor, depressing wages for citizens while failing to address training and education their own people.

Notable too that the tech industry has been on absolute fire because of growth companies in the inflationary cycle, there's a reason big tech has been doing TONS of layoffs disproportionate to the market recently, and why the number of openings rose so quickly in the last 2 to 3 years (and it's not just remote work/covid.).

It's demographics. People working versus not working, by age. So as population declines, there is an unbalanced number of older people who don't work but still need services. The shortage is the younger people who work.
Afghanistan and Iraq was less about bombing something into the stone age, and more about trying to slowly change a regime and build a pro-democratic government, which failed. Likely because they didn't really care all that much, it was just very profitable for defense contractors for the war to continue, the danger wasn't all that high compared to other conflicts, and those defense contractors can foot tons of money to campaign donations, keeping things brewing.

It's also not very clickbait. Ukraine doesn't have air defenses competent for defending against ballistic missiles, and Russia has been prioritizing strikes on Ukraine's energy grid to freeze the country into submission. Combine the two, and Ukraine could be having a HORRIFIC winter...
The appropriate reply from Biden should be that "I went to where I was wanted and needed. When Democrats proposed regulations they were always turned down by the GOP. And in fact it was Trump who eliminated the regulations that would have prevented this disaster. The person you and your neighbors voted for. So I am doing what you have asked and not involving myself in the mess that you helped create for yourself. When you wish to discuss proper safety regulations and pressure your leaders to talk to us about reasonable measures we will be happy to sit down and talk. But I am just following your wishes right now in that it was your decision to support politicans like Trump and the Republican party who didn't think these type of regulations were appropriate.".
We’re debating people who still want to think pilgrims/settlers and indigenous Americans (Indians, for the culturally challenged) actually started the thanksgiving holiday. The capitalist propaganda is deeply rooted in the minds of Americans. I don’t know how to counteract that but it’s the clearest challenge to American exceptionalism I can think of.
> A few miles away, another prison employee, Crystal Minton, accompanied her fiancé to a friend's house to help clear the remnants of a metal roof mangled by the hurricane.

Exactly. I’m certain once Trump doesn’t get the RNC nomination he will split off and run as an independent. I can’t wait to find out what percentage of the right will be maga loyal to the bitter end.
The seven main sources of energy that are found in India. The sources are: 1. Coal 2. Mineral Oil 3. Natural Gas 4. Thermal Power 5. Firewood 6. Hydro Power 7. Nuclear Power.
7. Obviously developed countries would help by the way of financial assistance to poor and developing countries in their journey to renewables not just for the historical emissions but also beacause it goes a long way to help prevent a global catastrophe.

So, if developed countries are really serious about phasing out fossil fuels, why not all fossil fuels, why should developing countries be forced to spend money right now while developed countries can sit around using their gas powered plants for longer period of time.

If only coal is phased out, developing countries would need to construct gas/ petroleum based power plants till they have sufficient renewable infra to substitute, or go on massive infra spending on renewables right now.

In short, India wants phasing out of all kinds of fossil fuels simultaneously from both developing and developed countries.
Yeah 100% you can’t just have departments of people allowed to subjectively decide if you can or can’t exercise your 2A. I’m all for requiring training and class work, background checks, waiting periods, strict ownership requirements and liabilities for storage security, etc etc, but shit like this is nonsense and does not increase public safety.
No. Proponents of the law will point to shall issue wording while ignoring that cops get discretionary power in who gets a license. Until the permit process is developed and in place there can be no gun sales in Oregon. Just getting the infrastructure could take years. There are no public ranges for people to use and no money for the permit system. It makes people pass the same background check twice. All in all, it seems like a feel good law more than an actually useful law.

Compromise? As someone who lives in Oregon and have closely followed gun control in the state since 2014, there is no compromise desired by the controlling party and their donors.
Just think about how Donald Trump won the presidency by just thousands of votes across multiple key states. Think about how huge a difference such a small margin made. There is no such thing as a disposable margin for Republicans if they want to remain relevant on the national scale going forward. Unity must be total. Donald Trump can make that impossible. There can be no unified social media message if anyone opposed to Trump controls any amount of the messaging. The GOP can't survive Donald Trump going rogue. It especially limits this brand new House majority's life expectancy. And if the Trump wing is small and unable to dominate, they will still set fires that will hurt other Republicans.
Exactly. Any democratic win is now fraud. Apparently, dems always cheat but they’re really bad at it. They cheated enough not to lose as badly as expected but not enough to maintain power in congress.

Compared to the other Cold War era reconnaissance platform, the SR-71, it’s quite simple in principle. The materials are rather exotic, and the mission package are quite in depth, but just the aircraft without everything else - it’s engine, wings that seem to go on forever, and a lot of clever solutions to problems of high altitude. Sure, it’s quirky - like, you need a spotter to help you land, and you have to wear a fucking space suit to fly it - but contrast that with the SR-71 which had special turbine + ram jets, a tendency for sonic booms to form inside the engines requiring these movable cones, and was generally always trying to kill her crew with unstarts and the like. I’d argue the U2 is a much simpler platform and that is why it outlived the SR-71. Shit, the SR-71 took special jet fuel, needed TEB to light the burners, and had a fleet of special tankers that just carried JP7 only. I’m saying all of this as the SR-71 being my favorite aircraft of all time.

I can and will still vote for the Democratic candidates down ballot. I just won’t tick the Presidential one.
I also have to say that I've seen a lot of well-meaning people mistake the arbitrary nature of gender for sex. Gender is arbitrary and biological sex, for the vast majority of human beings, is not. Intersex traits that would result in meaningful sexual ambiguity are (not, as some have said, as high as 1.7%). That doesn't mean it doesn't happen, but it's not the case that human sex is as fluid as gender, or that we shouldn't still think of biological sex as dichotomous in the general sense.
Exactly. These people cannot out reason their opponents, so they prefer to yell over them repeating the same points. Other person gives up, and they think they won.

I do have to say though, that I can completely support transgender people ascribing to whatever gender they want (including no gender), using whatever bathroom they want, and getting gender-affirming surgeries (after all, what are breast implants and hair plugs but affirmations of one's gender identity), while thinking that women should decide for themselves whether their athletic organizations will allow trans women.
If you're worried about a pandemic. Now would be the time to begin prepping like any disaster. At least a couple days of non perishable food and water, crank radio, flashlights, batteries, blankets, first aid, etc. If you arent willing to prep then you arent that worried.
If you dont think a couple days is enough, prep for however long you think you need to. 72 hours is the rule of thumb for general disaster preparation. You could prep for 3 months +.

I dont know. What I'm saying is, if you're worried about it, start preparing for it. If you arent willing to prepare for something, then you arent that worried, you're just looking for something to doomscroll about.

60% mortality. And it is extremely lethal among sea lions in nature and minks in captivity. The mortality rate among chickens is north of 90% in 48 hours. But regular influenza is pretty moderately contagious , about half as contagious as the original covid. Current variants of covid are much more contagious and less deadly. Covid revealed much stupidity , but most people (more than half) wore masks and got vaccinated. That level of compliance would kick influenzas ass. Or maybe pandemic influenza is more contagious, but we have little direct evidence of that. The space of possible plague is large, and covid ain’t shit compared to what is possible… even inevitable over long time scales. But H5N1 is probably manageable, with reasonable precautions .

Absolutely. The only way I can make any sense of the Russian government and its actions is when I think of it as a criminal organisation of some sort. Its only goal is to enrich itself and expand its influence. And putin is the main [Thief in Law] (.

I still think the commanders themselves are competent (not genius by any means but competent) but years of Zerg rush working and fighting vastly less well armed opponents has given them false confidence about their abilities and putin taking personal command of strategy (pretty sure I read that earlier in the year) and ordering non-strategic or heavily armed cities to be taken along with the well known vast corruption in the logistics and procurement departments along with laughable supply lines has hampered any hope they did have for a victory.

But, to be relevant, she must not file criminal charges against him. As soon as she formally accuses him of DV, his rights are automatically suspended, pending acquittal or dismissal of the charges. As he has been accused, he is now entitled (and obligated) to respond to those charges.
Still, the key factor here is that "due process" is necessary to suspend a right, and "due process" must include the right of the accused to meaningfully respond to the accusation. That right is present in a criminal case; it is not present in the process of acquiring a restraining order.

For that situation to be relevant to the matter at hand, she will have to file for the restraining order against him. There are no legal provisions for him to meaningfully respond to a restraining order. He is not entitled to counsel. He is not allowed to offer evidence, cross examine witnesses, or call his own. The only thing he can do during a hearing for a restraining order is stand there and wait for the judge to issue the order.

I’m not an expert…. But I do work in an area where funding projects and projecting future revenue is a big park of my job (lead innovation for a large company) so these options routinely fuck my ability to do my job well (i need funding for projects with no short term ROI). From my understanding, the alternative is a stock buy back… essentially… you go public to raise $$ and are expecting to give a return on that investment as long as the lended $$ is outstanding… so you pay the $$ back via a stock buy back, that way you no longer are responsible for what is essentially interest on a loan.

Absolutely not. Right after reading the Constitution in its entirety, organizing the Biden Laptop committee, organizing the anti-FBI committee, filing their articles of impeachment against Biden, and doing something with "anti-woke" they will hop right on that budget! And vote to increase it by means of tax cuts for the hyper rich.

Exactly. That wasn’t a rebuttal. This wouldn’t have flown in a middle school debate class. It was a generalized whine session, call to arms that could have been pre-recorded weeks or months ago. Just another angry white woman in the south sucking the tit of family connections and entitlement.

I'm a fiscally conservative/socially liberal republican. I have never been at a lower point than I am tonight. The President of the United States is literally a "weekend at bernies" prop that that the dems keep shooting up with drugs and rolling out on a hand truck to the American people and 1/2 of the country actually cheers. On the right we have the absolute shit show of an election(or whatever the F you call it) for the the speaker of the house and now this, Sarah Huckabees disjointed rebuttal to the state of the union.
so he wants to stop people from being taught the vague term “ideologies” that he doesn’t like bc he considers them “political”…it’s wild to see that now everything is becoming political. Science. History. English. I bet even math will become political soon. They’ve amped up their war against education and it’s scary how blind people are to see it. Supporters will say “you shouldn’t be forced to learn about that” “they’re forcing people to become liberal”…NOBODY is FORCING anything on anybody. What a fucking shame these people think that their students / children aren’t able to THINK for themselves. Do they think that no conservatives come out of college conservative? I can bet there are, didn’t a lot of those conservatives in government get a degree from “liberal” universities? What happened to them? Aren’t they LIVING PROOF that people can freely think for themselves and make decisions on what they want to believe in? No, Florida just wants to dictate and control what people are even exposed to or hear about. They want the GOVERNMENT to control what professors teach and HOW they teach it. When will climate science become unreachable in Florida? That could be considered an “ideology” of the right-wing who thinks that climate science is just politics to control the world. I’m fucking tired of how blind people are to this demagoguery. The right will literally say “ government is too big, it can’t make me pay taxes to fund somebody’s education or housing or food” but will then say government has the power to control women’s body and choices, control what books you’re able to read or what classes u can take or the content u learn; these people have actual brain rot. These people really are just full of anger and resentment and hatred.

...And the National Archives asking another former President to return documents they know he still has not returned, told he doesn't have them, then told he has them but they are not securely stored, told he has now locked them in a room that is supposedly controlled access, has his property raided to recover them where documents are also recovered located elsewhere, is told the documents aren't classified because he declassified them without telling anyone else who is part of the declassification process and supposedly did this back when he was still President, told them a special counsel is needed to review all documents recovered before any of them can be reviewed by the investigators since they may have non-classified materials, and may still have more unrecovered documents stashed away in a location that is extremely difficult to get a proper warrant to check since it requires exhuming a grave located on private property.
I try to get democrats to label republicans correctly that they are a communist cult. They act like a modern communist party you would find in commie Russia or China. Not even getting into their Russia and putin love. Liberals tell me they aren’t communists! They are facists they are authoritarians they are semi fascist. These labels do not work. The republicans don’t care when you call them that. Americans don’t know what you mean when you call them that. We need to call them commies morning noon and night instead of the fucking gop. Because they will call us communists just like trump did and Desantis will. They will call us that with zero evidence while they cup putins balls. Democrats won’t call them communists because it may not be exactly historically correct and there are some on the far left of the spectrum we might offend. Fuck that call republicans what they are a communist cult of weak men with massive daddy issues.

>On Monday, the New York Times published an explosive story revealing that George Santos, a New York Republican elected last month to the House of Representatives, had made what appeared to be brazenly false statements about his background, including assorted claims about his business career. He had boasted of being an accomplished investor and financier who had worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Yet each firm noted it had no record of his employment there. He had said he graduated from Baruch College. The school said he had not. His personal finances seemed odd as well, and he had worked at a Florida company called Harbor City Capital that was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021 of running a $17 million Ponzi scheme. Subsequently, he supposedly made at least $3.5 million from a mysterious company called Devolder Organization LLC that he started, that had no public profile, and that was dissolved soon after it was created. This marked a dramatic shift from his first run for Congress in 2020, when he reported earning $55,000 per year. The day after the Times story appeared, Santos took a curious step: He revived that mystery firm that he had claimed as the source of millions of dollars of income, and he listed as its address a Florida property associated with a former top official of the company that allegedly mounted that Ponzi scheme.

"Fine, after denying it for 40 years we will finally admit climate change is real BUT we're going to claim it's not caused by people so there's nothing we can do. Maybe in 20 more years we'll admit it was us all along, you know, when it's really too late.".
"Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations. However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50% since 1970 (Living Planet Index).Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends.We show that, of taxonomic–geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations). The remaining 98.6% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend.".

Now? We bought our first home this year in the Twin Cities and there's a good chance we never come back. We've talked about it and with how Iowa continues to devolve into a nightmare. Why would we ever want to try to raise a family where our child would go to a declining public school system, have few protections or even really be safe if they were a girl, LGBTQ, or a child with special needs? Hell if we even tried to start a family and she has an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage she could die or get in serious legal trouble because the state is trying its best to become Gilead? We used to lead the nation in education and were one of the first states to allow gay marriage. What has happened to this state is abhorrent.

Russia's blustering has reached the point of absurdity. If I were advising strategy for the U.S. & Europe, I would contend that they are indeed a paper tiger, and to call their bluff. For every announcement that Russia makes threatening vague, but grave consequences for the support of a NATO country, (like releasing video of an icbm missle with multiple warheads being loaded into a silo), I would counter with a brief and consistment statement which states NATO will continue to provide any support they deem fit to assist Ukraine to regain their illegally annexed land. Period.
They won't even need the US. Greece has enough Exocet missiles to make every russian vessel, boat, canoo and jetski into a fish hotel. For the shit Greece gets its anti air umbrella is probably the most capable in Europe, and have a reserve system capable of amassing an army large enough to make everyone sweat within days. Russia scares no one militarily. Unless they want to rule of a world of rubble by nuking everyone they can't expedition into Europe any more than Tuvalu can into Australia.

I ordered a rifle at a hunting show in Reno in the mid 90s after watching the manufacturer's video of a shot taken at an Iraqi tank commander from a long distance, crumpling him, then several seconds later his crew throwing their mess kits in the air as they dove to the ground when the sound wave arrived.

Fair enough. Also, US was in Iraq illegally, but not Vietnam. Vietnam was technically still under French rule, and the French invited them. That said, I prefer it your way. Law is a silly thing, and the US had no business in Vietnam.

I am a gay man. I am right leaning but libertarian. I agree with gay marriage and weed legalization but I disagree with Democrats on some issues. I guess I am politically homeless. I did vote for Biden in 2020 not because I liked him but because I think that Trump has little respect for the Constitution or rule of law, ( confirmed by his recent comments) and his irresponsible handling of COVID-19 and his irresponsible rhetoric and behavior on the issue.

How is it not? I mean sure, in a better world those shouldn't be things. In this world, however, one party straight up hates LGBTQ people and constantly tries to legislate their rights away.

When one party constantly votes to harm LGBTQ people and the other does not, the term 'identity politics' becomes completely meaningless.

I’m a pro-life atheist. By which I mean I think abortion is immoral, but I still think it should be legal. I have no belief in god. I will judge the shit out of people killing fetuses though, because there is no way to determine when it goes from being a “bundle of cells” or a “fetus” to being a “baby” with any certainty. And I hate that the left has just totally gone crazy and said that “don’t have sex if you aren’t ready for a baby” is such an evil thing to say to people. It’s your body your choice when you have sex too, we aren’t dumb animals. As little as 10 years ago my stance was the same as Biden’s and was viewed as acceptable by pretty much anyone, nowadays both sides have hunkered down and gone insane on the topic.
Demanding unwavering loyalty to their organization. They forget and ignore that they are civil servant employees hired by their employers (voters) to do the job they were hired to do, are paid their employee wages by taxpayers, and are accountable to citizens.

The documents provide a rare window into the inner workings of the cable news network and show how publicly Trump-friendly personalities were privately repulsed by the president’s post-election actions, with Carlson referring to Trump as a “demonic force,” according to the filings.
Fox News’s most prominent hosts and top executives agonized behind the scenes in the weeks following the 2020 election as they watched allies of Donald Trump appear on their own airwaves promoting false conspiracy theories about a stolen election, according to internal emails, text messages and depositions excerpted in a new court filing.

Fox’s decision-desk analysts were days ahead of other news outlets in making the controversial call, which infuriated Trump and his supporters — including many Fox viewers.

Dominion is using such messages to make the argument that Fox was motivated by competitive pressures from smaller pro-Trump cable stations like Newsmax that threatened to lure away its viewers. Carlson, in his message, specifically warned that Newsmax “could be devastating to us.”.

The entire missile strike seemed pretty inconsequential, yes, they hit some of our energy infrastructure, but we are used to it by this point, the situation with electricity didn’t get significantly worse from it. They even fired 2 of their “hypersonic” Kinzhals at Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia, which we can’t intercept, they hit their targets, but so what? It didn’t really change anything. I guess it just shows how upset Russians were about tank deliveries that they decided to fire their wonder weapons at us. Well, at least North Korea has Russia’s back, they will console them about the “evil west trying to inflict defeat on them”. I would be very concerned if my country’s best ally was North Korea, but it seems Russia welcomes it.
Interesting. I suspect you're right though. Russia is trying to regain control over the operation from Wagner. I also don't see how anyone could "take over" the command of the whole operation and not immediately make changes. Putin would be furious if no changes were made, even if making changes would not result in any sort of real victory.
Taiwan seems to be doing exceedingly well regardless, and something tells me that the CCP doesn’t really have the balls to change that status quo. By the time they need to, they won’t be able to.
It's dangerous when so many people support a movement that has no logistical planning laid out for the public to see, people should know what they're getting themselves into, which is one of the reasons why Brexit shouldn't have happened the way it did, there should have been several years leading up to it so all of the false promises would have time to be shot down by people who do actual research, that's one of the reasons why Scotland's independence vote is so dangerous, because no one has a clue what it could actually entail yet many vehemently support it.

And let’s be honest here. Anyone who says it should be 75% wouldn’t agree to recognize the result if a referendum ended up being won by the Yes side with 75.1%. They’d say it was too close and should now be 80%. It’ll just never be enough.

I see it a bit differently, during the whole Brexit thing the conservatives were proposing all sorts of ridiculous stuff that wasn't feasible by any means (NHS reduced costs, rights to fully stop illegal migration just like that ect), but also weren't part of their campaign promises, just misinformtion that would slowly seep into people's minds and make them think it's good without actually having any solid evidence. Scottish independence is the same in that way, as there is no evidence that they can rejoin the EU, as they lack a massive amount of things needed to do so, also people never mention how big of a hit it'll have on their economy as a whole, most of what gets mentioned is things like your vote meaning more, how the UK left the EU, how Scotland should make their own rules ect, but just like UKIP it's all fanfare to make the public support the idea, without having any actual evidence that it'll play out any better than Brexit did. It's dangerous making such massive decisions, Brexit showed that, and there's no reason Scotland should make a similar mistake.
If Ashli's mom is angry, she should be directing that anger at the 2 male insurrectionist who broke the window of that door while screaming, threatening, and physically intimidating the police officers who were trying to guard it. Then, once the window was broken, instead of either of the 2 men who broke it trying to climb through it, they get nervous because they can see the secret service agents holding guns and yelling for them to stop--so they turn around and BOOST Ashli up and through the window. When she gets shot, they panic and run away. Funny how those men were so brave until it came to actually climb through the window that Secret Service guns were trained on while they yelled at the terrorist to stop or be shot.

Exactly. I'm not saying they deserve leniency or that, frankly, Ashli didn't get what she deserved. Just saying it's sad their reality is so far gone and that demagogue, fascist, wannabe strong men are willing to use them that way.
That's not what I was referring to. I am referring to the fact that third parties can't get on ballots with fed funding because they need to surpass some arbitrary threshold of votes in other primaries. That is not a free democracy. The green party under Nader had to gonthrough many many elections before it was accepted. (Screw the Green party btw) On top of that the DNC and RNC control spending and the media so that third parties don't get their voices heard. No matter which you spin it, it isn't set up to allow outside voices a role in our "democracy.".
My pet theory is that what isn’t being articulated is that once the democrats abandoned labor and traded it for heavier identity politics (neo liberalism), a lot of workers who harbor angry bigoted stuff anyway are spite voting to send a message to the democratic establishment that isn’t being heard and gets turned into sOcIaLiSM. This didn’t happen in a vacuum. The Democratic Party is infuriatingly inept and the Republican Party was cunning in helping engineer all this. So now you have workers actively screaming and voting against their interests they cared about in the first place, and that conclusion is nothing that anyone hasn’t said before. But how we got there is worth understanding and I’m just theorizing.
Yeah remember that one young athlete which was under sweedish or finland flag and after he won medal he presented Z symbol and praised the war or shit like that? Fuck'em.
I think, if we let North Korea compete, which is basically a pseudo less developped 1984 state, China who is actively conducting a genocide, Russia was fine after invading Georgia and bombing Kurds and other innocent civilians in Syria, the US didn't get any reprimand from the IOC after invading Iraq and Afghanistan, then holy shit let's not make the russian people unable to participate in international events, how can that do anything but spark a renaissance of soviet era hatred towards the west and even more far right movements to take off?

Meh, I don't know what to make of this. You would hope that the state sponsored drug cheating and match fixing would have gotten them banned (stuff that directly impacts the competition). But no, now there's a war that has the eyes of all the first world countries on it and they're probably going to get banned. I'm not saying they shouldn't be banned but the hypocrisy of the IOC is too much to take anymore. Maybe it's time to just drop the olympics entirely and people can watch what they want to watch.
US military is no stranger to waiving criminal records and allowing an option to enlist in lieu of prison for certain crimes. Not like what Russia is doing now but mercenaries are often pretty damn nasty and get away with it because at the end of the day it takes some nasty people do nasty things to other nasty people. The military itself has a huge rape problem that got worse the entire time I was in and continues getting worse since I’ve been out. I’m not equating US military to Russian military that would be ridiculous. US military are professionals and Russians are clowns. But at a macro level we call a lot of other countries out for things we also do. Shady mercs being one. And I will not defend contract mercs regardless.

Not necessarily. Where i live (this isn't the case every where) you can vote on either side of the primaries. So I know people who voted on the conservative side during primaries, but Dem in the general.

He really ruined political drama. How do you have a show about bad people in power when we are seeing much worse examples in the news every day? Frank Underwood seemed like a terrible person to have as a leader until Trump shows up and makes him look like he belongs on Mount Rushmore.
Do you remember polonium poisoning? Polonium is a terrible poison which is very likely to kill the poisoner while simultaneously having uncertain effect on the victim depending on how well it's applied. It's crazy expensive because the only way to get it is if you have access to a nuclear weapons program with very particular refinement capabilities. It's much easier to use a bullet or a knife or a club to kill someone. The only reason to use polonium is if you want everybody to be absolutely sure who called for the murder. Putin may grin and claim he's never heard of polonium, but that's just diplomacy, unimportant in his worldview\; Telling his dissidents they're going to die screaming of radiation poisoning if they become intolerable, even if they escape to a NATO safe harbor, is politics.
I.e. there's a lot of deaths from heart attacks and drug induced heart attacks, and falling off and out of things.

Dude seriously? That's seven hours I'm going to have to mod that game just to reinstall it, play it for 2 hours, and then forget about it for a year or so.
There would need to be monetary incentive for that. The only ethical way of doing so would be for all member states of the UN, or at least the richest ones, to chip into a conditional fund (the condition being no more deflorestation/reflorestation) of enough value to offset the incentives of developing the land. That's not likely to happen, so environmentalists are trying to look for other methods to do so, like carbon credit, reforesting unused lands outside the amazon, and incentivizing eco-friendly/better industries and agricultural production (biomedical research, nature tourism, more sustainable forms of farming).
I know what you’re talking about. It requires fire, so your claims of it being “man-made” when they just burnt soil. The ingredients were made by the rainforest. And I’m not giving the name, because you’re not nearly as smart as you think. And selfish morons, when given the name, will run with it as far as their imaginations will go. Some fucking dipshits in Wyoming will think that it would save their shitty farm that they’ve ruined by failing to rotate crops.
That being said, Trump's presidential announcement couldn't have been placed at a worse time and was met with crickets. He didn't energize anybody and has exactly zero momentum. I imagine he's hoping to recreate his bullying the other candidates in the primary debate stage thing. Who knows if that works twice though.
Let’s be real here; the DOJ is going to do a half-assed dog&pony show trial with Trump, the worst punishment he’ll get is fines & a ban from holding office again, the GOP & enough Americans will be satisfied enough with that punishment that Trump will stop being a major issue in politics, and meanwhile even more dangerous fascists like DeSantis will continue grabbing the power levers in this country while the Democrats stand by and rake in their cut from the donor class in exchange for not stopping it. And Kanye’s mental health spiral will help keep the rest of us distracted after that.

they are called "Dark Ages" because there was a big gap of knoweldege in that period. There are TONS of historic documents in the Roman era which quite suddenly stopped. The decline in literacy also caused a decline in historic documentation. I.e. a lot of the time every early monestary had their own writing style, making deciphering them near impossible. Only after Charlemagne was a more standard scripture developed across Europe.

Lol ok goofy. Tell that to the women that are dying because they can’t get abortions. Men are always trying to control women’s bodies with religion. A man should have no say in what a woman does with her own body.

You are making assumptions and call me scientifically illiterate? Read the study for what it is and the RESULTS speak for themselves. You can make assumptions all day long. If suicide was government assisted and available, you’d have atheists lining up all day long sadly.
It's crazy to me that 1 - women there risk getting killed just for demanding basic rights, and 2 - the men who support them are in danger as well, such as their World Cup team. It really shows me what I take for granted every day.
if you want non censored intel from inside iran, which is trusted, you can use r/Newiran, it includes videos from the said time with uncensored footage of what people are suffering from inside iran, without any lies, unlike the r/Iran and r/Iranian subs which have shown to delete and ban people over posting content about the protests in masses, I'll leave you with this intel source, and if you can share it around, the more people know accurately about this, the better.

They get raped. They ask for abortion pills from their families. They literally pick the pretty ones to take to jail. They get beaten by men much stronger than them. Ffs they coukd go to prison for not wearing a piece of clothes on their hair. It's not SAME risks.

the national football team has in it multiple footlickers of the regime, they basically have bowed down to them disgusting fucks up there, have had interactions with them, were funded by them for other things, and have posted support for those said disgusting fucks historically and STILL DO, they celebrated scoring goals in some matches, while people in iran were mass murdered in mahabad and other parts of iran.

And no. That’s not what I’m trying to say. I know this is a fight for both men and women. They are both a part of it and they have both suffered under this regime. This goes without saying.

the 1st match they stud with iran as a form of 2 faced facade, but now we have seen them not do it, for multiple matches, it is not because they were threatened is what Majority understands from it inside iran because of their history with those disgusting fucks and people are right about it, we literally due to that celebrated america winning in the WC 2022 against iran, and that so hard that you could hear it in each city just by being in any neighborhood or street of any damn city.

Forgive my lack of knowledge on this. If I am wrong then I'm sorry. Is there any chance they've had a change of heart? I thought they were threatened by the government after that first match.
Hey bud, want to come backcountry splitboarding? We will wear beacons so if one of us becomes buried the other has a 20 minute time trial to dig the other out before brain damage and/or death!
hmm... interesting. not sure if the virus would survive in a mosquito. The mosquito sucks blood only once and then generate its offspring. So the virus has to transmit to the offspring before being transmitted to a host again.... well anyways I ask chat gpt...There is some evidence that mosquitoes are not able to transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes, and the virus does not replicate in mosquitoes. While it is theoretically possible for a mosquito to pick up the virus from a person's skin or blood and then transmit it to another person, this has not been demonstrated to occur in real-world conditions. The primary mode of transmission of COVID-19 is through person-to-person contact..... ok so the answer is maybe...
It won't open a Pandora's box because they can simply rule that the Republican uses of the precedent are constitutional and the democrat uses of the precedent are unconstitutional. You have way too much faith in the conservatives on the supreme court.
It's all connected as well, there's no denying it, culture, local and state laws, political ideology, socioeconomic status, upbringing, environmental influence, what type of information and media is being consumed, these things don't exist entirely independent of one another, and together they influence gun violence. Laws often change to reflect one of these variables, or are influenced by one of these variables and vice versa, it's all connected, the implication that the nature of gun laws have nothing to do with rates of gun violence ignores this very fundamental idea. Its not gun laws alone, but that also doesn't mean gun laws bear no impact on these things.

If only the world were so black and white. A 18 year old secretary in 1940 unlikely knew much of the Holocaust. And ask yourself, what lenhs would you go through to protect your family, friends, self under an oppressive regime. Its easy to say on Reddit "oh, id do the right thing.".
Citizens in Germany were subject to rationing, especially as the war progressed, and working in the concentration camps gave better rations than the alternatives - especially with a profession easily replaced like typist. Concentration camps were far from secret, and were actually touted in Nazi propaganda. And the public well knew being sent there was a death sentence, and that there were mass executions going on.

And knowledge that being sent to a concentration camp was essentially a death sentence was also fairly well known. It helped keep the population subjugated. Many also knew that mass executions were going on, even if the existence of gas chambers was not as well known.

Exactly. I’m Jewish and I would probably have believed it all if I wasn’t Jewish and was a German at the time. There was no internet, and nazis gave out radios and used propaganda on Germans for 20 years. If that was my only source of news I probably would’ve believed it until evidence showed otherwise. It’s important to know how this happened.
In a lot of ways, he's pretty fucked. If he backs out of the war, he's as good as dead, if he escalates to nuclear weapons, he loses China and India and probably sees NATO intervene. And his forces seem to be losing or holding in conventional conflicts, but he has an extreme faction at home that won't tolerate that and wants escalation or someone who will escalate. He's basically spinning a bunch of plates and hoping nothing goes wrong.

The article here is wrong to put the blame on Biden since the GOP has blocked immigration reform and efforts to deal with this more seriously. Truthfully there are limits to what he can do. However I do think it's a crisis. These huge influxes are really straining local cities who just don't have the shelters to handle them, and that means people are inevitably left behind or in the streets.
It doesn't seem that the resources are properly allocated since cities around the country have been declaring emergencies over influxes of migrants. Even California's governor said the state is at a tipping point. We already have a huge backlog of asylum applicants.

Seriously. The reality is conservatives never really care about what their criticism is about. As long as it is anti-democrat, that's all that has ever mattered. They literally don't have a platform besides being anti Democrat.

Could he? Would he? Bush could claim to be a moderate because he billed himself as a compassionate conservative, at least during the first election (which he lost but had the SC give him because of FUCKING FLORIDA!). Ron and the GOP have moved on to making cruelty the point. The country isn't split 50/50 Dems Republicans, there are independents and Fairweather non-voters. Is Ron going to pivot to the "middle" in two years, ans are those people going to believe it? Speculating so far in advance is really hard but like I said, the bloodthirsty cruelty seems to be a motivation for him not to even want to pivot.

Well, yes. The Republicans' only platform is tax breaks for the ultra-rich. That's literally the only thing they want. But, no one would ever vote for them if they were honest about it (just the ultra-rich). So, they have to put together a coalition of people who are willing to vote against their own best interests. Almost all their voters have to be idiots. It's no wonder they have a stranglehold on the least-educated voters. They also court all the 1-issue voters. They don't give a shit about abortion - they are rich and can travel to get one. They don't care about guns - if banning guns lowered taxes on the rich, the GOP would be leading the gun-control fight. They don't care about religion, or any of it. All they care about is getting to 50%+1 - so they can lower taxes on the ultra-rich. They will say and do anything to get there. So, they have no choice but to make people angry - so that those people will vote for them. They have to be like social media, chasing whatever's popular and gets them the most support. They've got to trick people into thinking the left is evil - so that people will vote against their own interests.
confrontational? That seems to be a nice way of saying divorced from reality and ignoring the rule of law. The republican party is no longer a political party, it's a cult.

1. It would set a precedent and rally supporters of DC statehood. While Puerto Rico has very likely to vote Republican, DC is an absolute lock in for Democrats.

Except Puerto Rico would be overwhelmingly likely to vote Republican. Latin cultures tend to skew conservative. They'll overlook a lot of problems with the party so long as it sticks to social conservatism.

But it is my experience that theology tends to make people into atheists, or at the very least, agnostics and atheist in all but name (with the rare exception who swings the other way around).
The only two people in church I know who have read the Bible are one, a super zealous convert, and two, a militant atheist who got offended when I mentioned the bible. I guess the pastor probably read the bible too.

Under our current brand of corporate feudalism, where companies use public funds to privately purchase stock buybacks and thousands of jobs are sacrificed regularly to pad a company's bottom line for the 500th time, this means anyone beneath the poverty line is functionally a slave and likely going to suffer at least several existential crises over the course of their working life.

I lot of the time the fee is the company passing their credit card processing fees on to the customer. I ran the online store for a nightclub and the owners had me add a processing fee to all online orders because their processor charges a 3% transaction fee, and the store host also charges a 3% fee. Once they realized nobody was complaining about the online fee they started charging the same processing fee at the door. Gas stations have been doing the same thing forever.
Those 2 benefit very small segments of of the population as a whole, the student loans policy would target a subset of a minority that turns out to vote at around 48%, of that you need students who understand how much of their payments go to interest, a much smaller group, and an even smaller group who will remember in 6 months that they used to pay $60 more per month in loan payment, and yet an even smaller of that who actually bother to vote Democrat. You can probably put all that people in a gym auditorium.

They show up to court two or three days later and tell the judge that their son clearly needs help. The judge will appoint the public defender and tell the family that their son committed a very serious crime and there's a chance he could go to prison.
He's going to tell the family and the kid that the best chance is to try to negotiate a plea for minimal punishment and commitment to a inpatient psychiatric facility. They'll say that sucks, but it makes sense, I mean, he did do it right? And he's going to go and talk to the prosecutor. They'll haggle and the public defender will come back and say hey I got you a pretty good deal, you'll do at least 30 days in Juvenile detention but after that you can get out once there's a bed in a residential facility available. Then you'll go there, and you'll probably stay there for 6 months. But you're going to be on probation for 5 years, and if you violate the probation you'll probably go to jail.

This is a direct result of the tea party "scandal" during the Obama years. The IRS received a massive amount of claims to be tax-exempt from tea party groups then when they had to devote people and resources to these claims and start denying them republicans screamed they were being unfairly targeted. This resulted in a huge pain in the ass for the IRS, few friends work for them they talk about people going through all their work trying to find stuff. One friend specifically got pulled into a meeting over the abbreviation TP which obviously was for Tea Party and not Tax Payer. She knows someone who actually required surgies from joint injuries when the investigators demanded he had to look through hardcopies of files for literal months to try and find bias. They denied multiple request to use digitized files and in all those weeks/months of work he turned over nothing substantive.
Classic “conservative” economic theory. Any time the annual budget deficit gets under control pass massive tax cuts. Blame resulting deficit increase on democrats. Rinse and repeat. Our taxes are the lowest they have been in 100 years. Deficit is the highest. Hmm.
People like to forget that “the West” is not a monolith. Some parts can be pulling their weight, while others (like, as you mention, Germany) can be wringing their hands. This is particularly applicable within Europe, where there is a distinct East/West divide, and I have a feeling that’s who Zelensky is referring to with this statement: Western Europe.
You mean me? Yea I’m entitled because I’d like healthcare such as most first world countries have. Yet Ukraine needs a MORBILLION dollars. How stupid are you? Tax dollars should go towards your own community. If the military wants to support other countries let’s take it out of their ridiculous budget. Hopefully you aren’t being serious.

Blocked by who? Every single NATO member by deciding not to invite Ukraine? They wouldn't have passed the membership action plan to join, which is why they weren't invited to join the membership plan. You should look into the status of Ukraines government before 2015.

Yep used to work at one, I have PTSD from my childhood, seeing my cousin murdered, and working there for 2.5 years, it finally got to me and I had a mental breakdown and I had to leave. Also used chemicals that irritated my skin and lungs so badly and the only thing they would give me was a face shield. I had a broken wrist one time and my supervisor expected me to the the job of 2 people with one hand. One of the jobs I had was pulling the lard out of the carcass, the fat that covers the ribs, I had to pull those out by hand and it's causes a ton of trauma to your fingernails and causes them to fall off. My would fall out all the time.

Easier and quicker protein delivery in the body is better for repairing and building muscle (among many other things ), which is why whey protein isolate is the gold standard in terms of protein quality and efficiency. Plant protein isolate is still good, but definitely not on the same level as whey protein isolates or even the inferior whey concentrates.

We've literally had them for well over a decade now. Do you not understand this, it was such a success they've been able to run it for hours at a time as well even on the first test and was a potential choice of the ABL system(which went with a much more powerful chemical laser setup). The JHPSSL system was a wild success, feel free to look up all the wonderful papers that were birthed out of it. Obviously you'll find quite a few redactions and the actual.. applications of the tech in the actual devices fielded aren't available to the public. But anyone with any passing interest knows about it rofl.
It's basically already fully developed. They made sure to show it off to Biden when he visited. They want the Americans to be involved inorder to get business from them, and better their chances of selling it to European country's. It also means that American dollars goes to further r@d for the tech wich Israel is involved in. It's kind of like almost all American fighter jet pilot helmets are made by an Israeli company.

I’ve been all the way down this path. Here’s where it ends “I don’t like his style, but he says it like it is and my life is better for it” then they shut down.
My name is Gilles Paris, and I'm a journalist who spent seven years in Washinon D.C. reporting on American politics as the White House correspondent for France's leading newspaper Le Monde. I had the task of explaining to French readers, who still consider themselves very rational, how the United States could have elected Donald Trump as president after Barack Obama. This was no mean feat, even with a White House accreditation, especially during the pandemic. I also took advantage of my seven years to travel to 47 states (still missing: Hawaii, Alaska, and Maine) and fall in love with the R.V. way of life!
Her years as a senator and her status as a former Secretary of State in addition she was highly educated as a lawyer and former partner in a firm even having made her start as an aide kn the Watergate investigation. She also was well familiar with Washinon political machine so she had congressional and cabinet level experience, I don’t think anyone else running at the time could claim this.
If you put this to voters in individual states its going to go in favor of abortion rights. Literally the minority controlling the majority. Even in red states there are conservative voters that are moderates and they lean left on this issue. The evangelical right has pushed the GOP so far to the right on this issue they've lost moderate Republicans. Even before Kentucky and Kansas we've seen voters undercut the GOP legislatures attempts at fckn over voters. Seen voters in states vote on something and then the GOP legislature either trying to undo the vote or just attempt to ignore it all together. Right now GOP legislatures are looking to push through legislation that strip voters of their power to vote on initiatives and referendums. GOP reaction to being a shrinking minority is to openly manipulate our democracy at every level to insure they can hold on to power just a bit longer. McConnell worked to manipulate the makeup of SCOTUS to give evangelicals what they wanted in return for voted. McConnell doesn't care about gay rights or abortion rights or gun rights because they're just red meat to keep voters in line. He needed SCOTUS to rule on cases small, big that aided in some way to helping donors maintain power, influence, and to keep stealing from voters in every way possible. Read the SCOTUS docket throughout the year and see the cases that the public fails to pay attention to. These cases do damage to all Americans. Worker's rights is one big area that is gutted by right-wing judges across the country and in SCOTUS. Every case has the potential to open doors or shut doors with different results that hurt us for years to come.

Their condemnation of Trump sitting down with infamous dinner guests is testing the waters. They are looking for real life indications that their party’s midterm election losses really do signal Trump fatigue. So far so good.
> The Justice Department’s success in removing Trump’s legal obstacles to its investigations may also be moving the country toward the resolution of one of the most fateful questions haunting any modern political campaign: Will an ex-president who is running for the White House again, and has a history of inciting violence to further his anti-democratic ends, face criminal charges?

Yes, I am aware of those. I don’t think state level cases especially the NY case have the potential to turn loyalties away from Trump and towards DeSantis. I think the NY case worst case scenario for him is its potential to negatively impact Trump’s businesses. I think criminal charges and a trial will result from the Georgia investigation but trumpanistas have already effectively cast that as an individual’s vendetta against Trump and his loyalists, just as they did with the members of the Jan 6 committee.
That is a perfect plan but I seriously doubt that is going to occur. Ukraine has short and sweet supply lines, they won’t the further from the Dnipro they get. If Russia blows the damn, bad time for Ukrainians. The current CO is not going to let Crimea fall. It would be a shame if he did too, how many Russians died over the centuries to get crimea in the first place. Whilst I don’t necessarily agree with that logic or feel like defending it that is of course the logic of Russia. If Russia has to give it up because it got it thru imperialism then I suppose the USA should give Mexico back it’s lost territory as well. I don’t think any of that makes sense either.
Did you see the video of the Russian newscaster who said that if he supports the retreat he's discrediting the territorial integrity of Russia and goes to jail (Russian criminal code section 280 article 1), and if he denounces it then he's discrediting the Russian armed forces and goes to jail (Russian criminal code section 280 article 3).
The tradeoffs just aren't worth it, especially now that missile and radar technology (and the ability to share that data) has come so far where modern jets have no problem engaging outside of visual range, making dogfights essentially obsolete.
They could and they did. Don't forget about the ballistic missile attack early in the war on the Ukrainian barracks. Russian ballistic missiles have good accuracy, they are just limited in the numbers. If they had the Intel on a AFU barracks, they'd hit it. Thankfully, they don't.

it is why the US invested millions in programs like the dragon lady or blackbird, and billions upon billions with spy sat + ground stations + an ASSLOAD of trained analytics that understands what the picture returned means (IE is it a command center with HVTs or troop sleeping quarters or just civs) for this capability.

Whoops, my bad. I was thinking about the Russian populace’s general view of Putin, so no /s needed. But yeah, for B_O_S up there, he needs it for himself.
I just checked. It was Michelle Obama on Colbert on last Monday’s show (November 14th - available OnDemand) where she said she warned everyone while he was busy debating Hillary Clinton, that he was not qualified to be president. That chaos would ensue. That the office of the president is “no joke.“ Tragically, that’s exactly what happened. If she said it, she really was prescient. And every time they talked about chaos and how they used that as a fulcrum to get elected, I can’t help but think of Sandra Bullock’s 2015 movie, “Our Brand Is Crisis.” Obama pointed out during her session with Colbert that the last several election cycles where people used that to scare people to vote for the Republican candidate citing all the havoc that is going on in our country currently, it did not fly at all.
Oh, please. "She allowed it to be eviscerated?" Was she supposed to murder the people voting against it? (No, that's Trump's gig).

The primary leaders of the Mujahedeen formed the Islamic State of Afghanistan following the defeat of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The biggest outcast from the Islamic State of Afghanistan was Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who now instead of waging war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan waged war against his former Mujahedeen allies.
The Taliban, literally Students, came about from Kandahar province under the leadership of Mullah Omar, a former low or mid level Mujahedeen, against the failures of the Islamic State of Afghanistan (both its ability to establish any sense or order, the constant fighting, and the fact that, like Hekmatyar, they found it was too liberal). There isn't really a direct line between the Taliban and the leadership of the Mujahedeen, again, as the Taliban rose up against the now divided leaders of the Mujahedeen. The former leaders of the Islamic State of Afghanistan then tried to form a resistance, known in the West as the Northern Alliance, with their most prominent leader being Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud, along with Hekmatyar, was among the foremost of the original Muajhedeen.

Exaclty. They are Pashtun and many Pashtun do not care there is a border separating Afghanistan and Pakistan. They straddle the border and move pretty much freely between the two countries. The two groups are officially different groups, primarily with different missions. However, they are ethnically the same. One group runs the Afghan government now and the other is fighting against the Pakistani government.
Kind of like that video where the journalist (may have only been a protester rather than a journalist, I don't remember) got grabbed at a protest, dragged into a van, and tortured right there on the spot where people could hear her screams from outside the van. Then they disappeared her.
Immigration is not significantly motivating unemployment and housing problems in Canada, and even if it was I don't think that these problems are of the magnitude to justify policy as hateful as you are suggesting.

Not really actually. It's not that bad. In Russia if you are not physically present to receive the order yourself, you are not required to comply. However, they will certainly monitor when you return and serve you immediately. So he shouldn't go back if he doesn't want to participate in the war, but luckily his parents are likely in no danger.
Joining Garcia on the board is fellow conservative Bridget Ziegler, the wife of the Florida GOP’s chair and co-founder of Moms for Liberty, who also recently donated to DeSantis; Mike Sasso, an attorney who donated over $9,000 to Florida Republican candidates, including DeSantis, last election; Brian Aungst Jr., a Central Florida attorney; and Ron Peri, who founded the ministry “The Gathering,” which regularly spews nonsense about “Christian Nationalism.”.
I mean... idk. I grew up around pretty much exclusively republicans. I was 15 when 9/11 happened. Before that, they were also racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, gun loving, white business owners, or down on their luck momentarily broke millionaires. They decried "welfare queens" while taking disability, social security, writing every personal expense off as a business expense that they could, etc. They viciously joked about "violent thugs and criminals" (black people) and illegals while hiring undocumented immigrants under the table, committing crimes ranging from DV to SA fraud to theft, drugs to murder and suicides. I knew and saw a lot of violence, criminality, hatred, and not a lot of brown faces from the direction they were coming.
"Why do you want stupid western decadent crap like 'MacDonalds' or 'Ikea'?

Are you a traitor to your country? Russia produces the best quality merchandise and food, we don't need Western crap anymore. Accepting it at all was a mistake, just like the collapse of USSR Who needs Ford car when we have Lada, or the new elite car for Soviet citizen- the Putinobile No, we'll be just fine without that junk. Now go to town square in 5 minutes as Putin is due to deliver speech about a 'small' amount of Putinobiles exploding. All is good, Glory to Russia".
Exactly. Putin has managed to create an embittered and westward turning enemy with an enormous land border with Russia who will never forget. Great legacy, vlad.

This is still not a great solution for Putin because every day the war goes on they lose men and materials that could be used to support the Russian economy, and eventually Russia is just going to run out of many materials to wage war with and they'll be literally unable to even defend themselves against the potential invasion let alone continue and invasion of a foreign country. By that point Russia would be screwed and the hardliners will have lost everything they care about.

The biotechnology company Biogen and its regulator the Food and Drug Administration worked in concert, ignoring internal concerns from the company and skirting the agency’s own written guidance, to allow the Alzheimer’s treatment Aduhelm to receive accelerated approval and hit the market at a cost to patients of $56,000 a year, according to a scathing report released Thursday by two House committees.

The “unusual” collaboration, which resurrected Aduhelm three months after Biogen had canceled clinical trials, unfolded through at least 115 meetings, calls and email exchanges between the company and the FDA in a year, said the report by the Committees on Oversight and Reform, and Energy and Commerce.

So did I. You see, there was very little actual violence given the extremely large scope of the protests. And BLM protesters were deliberately being provoked by "law enforcement" and beaten and gassed and detained en masse and kidnapped off the street. And it is all on video.

The freeze peach absolutist could have bought 4chan for likely under a million. Instead, he bought twitter for 44 billion. He doesn't understand that moderation is the only reason for the difference in value. He sees mods as the enemy; people who cost something but give no value, He doesn't understand that it's the mods who create 85% of the value of twitter. Without mods, twitter would consist of a few thousand nazis and pedophiles, and no one else. Have fun, Elon.

Standing requires three elements: injury, causation, and redressability. The plaintiffs have to show they were “injured” by the doctor performing the abortion- this is already an issue, how is a random citizen harmed by a doctor performing an abortion? The easiest and most common injury is financial, but again, how do you show financial harm by a doctor performing an abortion?

The easiest and most common injury is financial, but again, how do you show financial harm by a doctor performing an abortion?
They have to further prove that the doctor caused the “harm” or “injury” against the plaintiff by performing the abortion, that is, that the abortion directly caused the harm.

No he wasn't. He was there and voted in favor of the sick leave. When that amendment was voted down, he then voted against the main bill. I hate Ted Cruz as much as the next guy, but get your facts straight.

Fundamentally, our legal and political systems evolved out of British colonialism, which was and is brutally effective at subjugating entire nations, while an extremely abusive and extractive ruling class get away with all manner of crimes against humanity.

Yeah. In fact, on another post on this sub about this same subject I just had someone block me after I simply made a few points about why there might be some drawbacks to Congress imposing seven sick days. Now I can't even read what they said in response without going through a workaround. People think everybody should always agree with their opinions in total and that there's no reason to even discuss anything else.

The problem is that neither party wants to totally destroy the restaurant and agricultural industries (among others) which depend on undocumented workers to do jobs Americans won't do under conditions Americans won't accept, that the Democrats don't want to make life even harder for the undocumented workers that would be impacted, and that the Republicans don't want to highlight how many huge Republican-donating big businesses they've been tacitly letting ignore the law while at the same time making it seem like all the blame deserves to be on the worker seeking the same kind of better life to which many of our ancestors had far easier access under far more open immigration regimes.

You can use the carrot or the stick. If you punish the corporations taking advantage of illegal labor, what happens to the laborers themselves when they lose their jobs? Doesn't sound like it'll be a great day for them, either.

Again, I can believe it. But I suspect the noncompliance is among the restauranteurs less likely to be well-networked with people like you.
There is some truth to this for anyone reading. Banks ignored small accounts due to the influx of people applying for PPP (both rounds, but specifically the first). You had to manipulate the system to get in the first round of PPP, so the loans (can we stop calling them that? I'm calling them free money from now on) were overwhelmingly given to those with better connections, higher status at the bank, and overall larger accounts. Some of them were even refusing to process applications for accounts already at their bank (except the largest) and were using the ability to get processed as an incentive to go after new customers. So, they were treating it like cell phone carriers - you switch to our bank, you get processed (if your account was large enough), but if you already were at our bank, you get nothing - unless you have a very, very large account and can actually get someone important enough on the phone.

You mean cripple further. That economy has been ruined for the coming decades. But change has to come from within. There is only so much the west can do to get the people to actually take action against their billionaire oppressers. The amount of destruction Putin and his cronies have caused in the past years cannot be ignored any further. Syria, Chenchnya and now Ukraine. It has to stop.
Furthermore this whole "forcing the whole world to play along" can have terrible consequences since not only are other nations forced to cut economic ties with Russia thus loosing valuable money but it would also cause them to feel resentful against The West, seeing their actions as forcing and strong-arming them into doing what they say or lose economic goods from The West which on top of making their sovereignty feeling violated along with how hypocritical it is for NATO to call Russia a terrorist state of the invasion of Ukraine while refusing to do the same thing for US due to Iraq results in these countries feeling alienated by Western powers and making them see The West as no different from Russia which is NOT what Western leaders want.
You should have supported them when China broke all agreements and imprisoned the opposition and installed their own political leaders. Now, they have no chance of coming back.
The \west\ also turned its back on economic liberalization by promoting anti-free-market intellectual monopolies. Copyright and patent steal from us all and must be abolished. 50% of all corporate profit is now through intellectual monopolies raising prices above what they should be naturally in a free market. Corporations \hate\ free market capitalism and have worked hard to achieve regulatory capture and propagandize us to believe copyright and patent are about helping poor starving individual artists/inventors and not the billionaires.

I don't know about that. China's economy since 1958 deviated from the Soviet "centralised economy" to a "de-centralised but still totalitarian" economy and there was no intention to ever give up on that totalitarian aspect of managing the economy on a macro level.

No, I don't. No one can predict how long Xi will rule. No one can plan for a life without him in power. The future is unforeseeable by that definition.
MTG has been a fundraising machine. The more extreme and obnoxious she is, the more money she gets. She supported legislation that would ban the display of Pride flags and what she called “hate America flags” at U.S. embassies. That got her a lot of donations. She also said the Black Lives Matter flag represents “a group who wants to erase our history and bring mass destruction to our country through Communism.” That brought in donations. She said, "The Equality Act that we are to vote on this week destroys God’s creation. It also completely annihilates women’s rights and religious freedoms. It can be handled completely different to stop discrimination without destroying women’s rights, little girls’ rights in sports, and religious freedom, violating everything we hold dear in God’s creation.” She got a lot of donations after that. She said, “Teaching racism and promoting sex, homosexuality, & normalizing transgender to children is mental/emotional child abuse.” More donations.
Not everybody is running and gunning from MTG's ultra safe seat. She'll do decades of damage in two years to the GOP if they let her do this.

Not to split hairs - I agree with your broader point - but there's a reason they didn't listen to Barry's warnings in 1981: they were still following Barry's lead from 1964. It was his campaign that birthed the Phyllis Schlaflys of the world who helped form the very same "Moral Majority" he rightfully railed against in his later years. , but it does a decent job of drawing connections between Reagan's rhetoric in 1980 and Barry's rhetoric 4 presidential cycles previously. His famous quote about how every good Christian needed to kick Jerry Falwell right in the ass was spurred first and foremost by Falwell's opposition to fellow Arizonan Sandra Day O'Connor's nomination to SCOTUS - something far more personal to Goldwater as a sitting US Senator from that state than broader disagreements on political views.
If and when the FBI (hah?) comes out and clearly identifies domestic terror threats, and they are unilateral, then the conservatives can just point back and say "see? they are coming for us, we told you this would happen, we are all going to be called domestic terrorists and they are coming for you now.".

In that decades-long shadow struggle, the United States, the Soviet Union and occasionally China poured military resources into protracted wars around the globe, engaging in bloody proxy conflicts from Korea to Vietnam to Afghanistan.
There is no doubt that China’s entry into the war in that manner would transform the nature of the conflict, turning it into an epochal struggle involving all three of the world’s largest superpowers and their partners on opposing sides: Russia, China, Iran and North Korea aligned against the United States, Ukraine and their European and Asian allies and partners, including Japan and South Korea.

Inflation is not the sole metric to determine whether an economy is healthy. The UK is performing solidly worse than the larger EU countries or the US. If you take a look at real GDP % change, the US economy has grown by 4,2% since Q3 2019 while Canada and the eurozone have grown 2,1% respectively. The UK on the other hand? Its GDP has shrunk by -0,4%. The UK economy is performing worse than its neighbors even if its inflation may be slightly more manageable than that of other countries. But honestly, that shit does not really matter. The rest of us Europeans are fucked as well, even if just slightly less so. The fact is that the world at large will almost certainly be in a recession sometime the next year. But because the UK has made trade that'd otherwise help enrich both itself and it's neighbors nigh impossible the way out of it will be unnecessarily long and cumbersome.
Seriously? Literally no one in the UK thinks he meant deploying the military as strike breakers. If the article was somehow unclear for you then you can google it and watch the actual BBC interview.
I suppose, at least, it would be helpful to identify any potentially dangerous mutations as early as possible.
China isn't unvaccinated. China has a serious problem with the elderly population being under-vaccinated which is the most at-risk group, and their vaccines are less effective, but the vast majority of the entire population will have a vaccine and two boosters minimum.

2. Herd immunity would not necessarily be conferred against mutations. Mutations are different from the original strain; some are so different that they can evade our body's existing defense systems. This is why as the pandemic continues and more mutant variants arise, pharmaceutical companies are designing new vaccines, because the old vaccines are not as effective against new variants. Your body's immune system is no different. If you caught COVID near the beginning of the pandemic, your immune system would know how to identify and destroy that original strain. But it may not know how to do so against Omicron or any potential future variants, depending on how different they are. In other words, future mutations would still have just as much of a chance of infecting you and producing symptoms.
This is all theater for Russian watchers. Doesn't matter how subhuman the speaker is, doesn't matter how improbable the outcome. The worst thing you can be in a Stalinist Dictatorship is weak, the second thing is disloyal. Its the same in the ccp too.
Also, if the Russian army is fully crippled in Ukraine by the West, then they would be open to retaliation from eastern european countries that would want revenge for the Soviet times, and put Russia through a century of humiliation. Russia should remember how Europeans are like when dealing with a weakened nation, since they did it to China last time.

Also, this is shaping up to be Russia's century of humiliation. I think the PRC remembers what happened in their history, and is taking pity on Russians right now. And besides, the last time Russia was getting their asses kicked in a war in Europe, with their economy destroyed, they turned to communism, so why would the CPC want to stop that?

so.. Russia right now is threatening UK, France, US, other NATO nations with nuclear destruction.. I'm fairly certain there are large groups of Chinese nationalists that would celebrate those countries suffering.
After the Roe leak, they told everyone to calm down, this is a states rights issue, nobody was going to try to ban abortion nationality.
It's complicated. I don't know his dad, but I do know people that I consider to be intelligent that got sucked into the propaganda machine. The "news" organizations that purport to inform them actually just lie to them and tell them scary stories about "the others" (basically anybody that's not a straight, white, conservative, natural-born citizen). After listening to nothing but lies and fear-mongering for years, these people have no real data left to make intelligent decisions. It's all bullshit that was specifically manufactured to control them. As long as they choose to stay in the right-wing propaganda bubble, they will stay this way. This is why the right-wing propaganda machine has demonized every other source of information. You can't listen to CNN, MSNBC, or NPR because they're the "mainstream liberal media" and they lie to you. You have to stay here and listen to Tucker because he tells it like it is. So, they're trapped by the fear and ignorance that was planted in them by the people they trusted to inform them. This isn't even touching on things like their social media presence or how they've taken over churches.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. What is that saying, never attribute to malice something that can be explained by incompetence?

First - both the EU and NATO immediately became the targets to reach for us. We started working on those goals as soon as we got the politics, money, etc somewhat sorted out.
Furthermore. In hindsight a lot of things we were taught in Swedish schools during the 70's and 80'd seems so wrong. And all the spies and informers, mostly with contacts in GDR, that were present everywhere in Sweden, sometimes in high places, is really scary to think about. All info about them have been made top secret in Sweden for many, many years to come. They are old now, but still walk free among us.

Finnish politics towards Estonia has sometimes been so-so in the past (unfortunately, our diverging histories and different experience with USSR has coloured our views differently until recently - IMHO Finns were too naive towards Russia, even though outside of Eastern European countries that suffered under soviet influence and occupation, Finland is probably one country that mostly had little to no dreams about Russia) and that has caused issues between the two countries, but it cannot be denied that Finnish civil society and Finnish estophiles were of a huge help during occupation period and later in the 90s. Finnish cultural society organisations were used to help Estonia pre-restoration of independence, for example (Tuglas-seura is what comes to my mind).

Four - Russia was in shambles; politically, economically, societally. It didn’t have the power to influence our countries AS much as it wanted, it was busy combusting internally. As Russia was undergoing alllll kinds of issues, we worked on getting our diplomatic ties back up and running, our economy routed towards Europe, our tourism open and welcoming etc. The Baltics worked their asses off to get into the association agreement phase of joining the EU and we tried to open and close the chapters ASAP. Same with NATO. We didn’t have any internal wars like in the caucasus, we fought with corruption, but it was never as bad as in places like Ukraine. The Baltics had always been the “west of the east” in USSR, so we were already better off in many ways when USSR broke up.

D) Ukrainian society was not that anti-USSR than the society in the Baltics were. Yes, they didn’t want the USSR when it ended, but I don’t think there existed the type of hatred towards USSR that existed here. That strong dislike fueled the Baltic states to do very painful things in order to cut the connections to Russia at a faster and a steeper rate;.
Yeah Israel can continue destroying gravesites of Palestinians and taking their homes Expand the settlements, who knew that things could be so great if we just surrender and accept whatever my neighbor determines is peace. What a wonderful world!
Palestine started the hostilities. Israel was willing to reach an agreement at the camp David negotiations in the 90s, but gasser Arafat tanked the talks over a refusal from the Israeli side to grant the Armenian quarter of Jerusalem to the Palestinians despite the fact that the Armenians in said quarter have been clear that they wish to remain with Israel and not go to Palestine. Quite hypocritical for a movement supposedly all about self determination and such…but really, the main reason he tanked the talks is because he was too scared of the violent zealots in his own ranks who would have defamed him for caching to the Israelis for any agreement short of Israeli handing over ALL of Jerusalem (an impossibility), labeled him a traitor and apostate for making peace with Israel and advocated for him to be killed. The Palestinians have started over a half dozen wars with Israel and lost each one, but refuse to introspect as a society (as the Germans and Japanese did after ww2) and reflect on how their hateful, warmongering ways have brought them to ruin. They are the agents of their own misery; the cause of their own ruin. As such, they do not deserve sympathy. If they’d have accepted the offer of the initial Jewish immigrants (who came legally and peacefully) to live in harmony and work together to build a better future, they could have benefitted from the modern education and European legal institutions and educational institutions those immigrants brought with them. Instead, they looked down on their superiors as “dhimmi” and “kafir,” and preached jihad against people they viewed as religiously inferior. This hatred and prejudice, as well as misplaced belief in their own inherent superiority, has been the bane of their existence ever since. The Israelis have advanced exponentially, while the Palestinians have stagnated and even descended further into the depths of poverty and misery because of their hate and rage filled identity.
Honestly I don't even think it requires being socially conservative. Having lived here all my life I think most Kansans, even the ultra conservative ones, really just want to be left the hell alone to live their lives. Sure they may not like "the gays", but even a good chunk of my religious conservative friends and family wouldn't support going back to gay marriage being banned again. They just don't want to be forced to be put in a situation where they're personally expected to act as if they condone it or support it (because while they morally object, they also believe it's not their business). It's a fine line, but I think it's walkable. State Dems here already focus more on individual liberty rather than specific social issues. The abortion vote is a great indicator for how Kansans feel generally - my decisions are mine and the government needs to stay out of it. And for the love of all that is holy the KS dems have to just leave the gun issue alone. Any politician even hinting that they support any kind of gun regulation in the state or nationally is dead in the water. (TX has the same issue and Beto sunk his own campaign.).

That’s not what your first comment said. Your first comment said “at least half the population”, despite the fact that only about a third of this country actually voted Republican in any election in my lifetime. Which is the initial thing I took issue with. I typed a bunch more than this, but I’ve seen this kinda shit before. You’re not arguing in good faith with me, and this discussion is deep in an r/politics thread, so no one’s benefiting. You wanna see projecting? I won’t argue with you about gerrymandering or voting systems because I know you “know” more power to the voter is a bad thing, and from your perspective, the GOP spending 60% of its 2020 budget for my state (in a year where small businesses were dropping like flies) on trying and failing to repeal ranked choice voting is a noble endeavor. I know you would present my position in a similarly unreasonable sounding way. Your research statistics will look different coming from your sources than they do from my sources, and neither of us will acknowledge each other’s sources as anything other than fake news. So imma just walk away now.

They even drafted the strategic missile guard. As in, the people whose job it is to make sure that Russia's nukes don't fall into the hands of terrorists. Sleep well tonight.
Putin's best bet to hold on to power (however temporarily) now is to publicly state that "With the heroic assistance of our Ukrainian brothers, we have stamped out the last vestiges of Nazi-ism and can now return our glorious military to its rightful place defending the Motherland." Followed by a full withdrawal.

The National Guard of the Russian Federation is the internal military force of Russia, comprising an independent agency that reports directly to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin under his powers as Supreme Commander-in-Chief and Chairman of the Security Council. They are well paid and there are like 350,000 of them. They are what is keeping the creep alive.

Russia will still be crippled economically for a generation, and will never be fully trusted again by the international community, but it gives him something to sell to the home market. It might even be enough to allow him to leave power through a door rather than a window...

Their rhetorics have changed, to save their own faces in public. Their campaigns are trying to erase their pasts, they’re more aggressive now than ever about having political power. They’ve just become sneakier and people are falling for it in droves.

Sweden still has "many steps to take" to win Turkey's approval for its NATO membership bid, a top Turkish official said Tuesday as Sweden's new prime minister visited Ankara in hopes of eliminating the hurdle to his country joining the military alliance.
Legalization of nearly every "illegal abuse substances" would fix most of it, actually. A lot of reasons why certain natural drugs are banned is because of medical lobbying, in order to corner narcotics markets. Otherwise relatively safe and cheap drugs that would help to treat those with undiagnosed medical disorders, would force lower medicine costs as people avoided expensive lab drugs in favor of anything that might be able to be locally sourced. Lower costs means easier preventative care as well, and preventative care means fewer long-term mental health problems, the primary source of people suffering from addictions in the first place.
They are cool! The breeder did a wonderful interview a year or so ago. My understanding is their Thai is a more recent acquisition, and that Kagyu from coastal seeds was gifted, traded for, or bought some Thai seed from older people who have had the plants since the 70s and kept them pure. And he has 4 or 5 different ones.

Basically we're at a stale mate until the UK finally gets it's shit together and starts building the relationship with the EU so ultimately another vote to join can be taken what would be years from now and impossible to say when, if or even if they will accept us because it is a very long time away before any UK government asks that question again.
Basically we are in a shit position with a government what won't back down because it will destroy them, the EU stuck not wanting to deal with the Tories due to the Tories going against anything EU related and things won't change until 2025, then after that it would be a good time to look at that question and see how the EU and UK relationship is going what I think very much depends on how we vote.

The predictions show our economy to finally grow in 2024 but honestly I doubt out government will be much help in making this happen, they are currently trying to destroy anything EU related to try and justify their Brexit claims what everybody knows is total bullshit at this point, but they can't back down because if they did the Tories would be basically admitting that everything from 2016 they have done has been total bullshit and it would destroy the party, this is the reason they are so bent on removing all EU laws even if they are among some of the best in the world for worker rights, health and safety, regulations etc...

Polling is snake oil. Most respected polls from 2013 to the day before the referendum all pointed to ‘Remain’ wining out.

Ah yes, Kwanzaa, that lovely holiday invented from whole cloth by a black nationalist in the 60s, who assaulted, imprisoned, and tortured numerous women in various ways including stripping and beating them with electrical cords, forcing water through their nose, shoving soldering irons into their mouths, and hitting them on the head with toasters.

The map lists states with laws protecting reproductive healthcare. There are additional states where state supreme courts have recognized an implied state constitutional right to reproductive healthcare (i.e., a "state-level" Roe v. Wade decision).
The states that have passed laws protecting reproductive healthcare are probably "safer bets" than those that only have state-level Roe protections, because some of the (which includes Florida, Kansas, Montana and South Carolina) have legislatures and/or governors that are very anti-choice. For example, the Iowa Supreme Court - which previously held that the Iowa Constitution protects choice - (just before SCOTUS reversed Roe) after the state's Republican governors successfully politicized the court.

Of course not. Problem is we’re divided on what means ‘healthcare’. Those morally opposed to abortion truly believe they are fighting for a righteous cause. What we lack is a common foundation for understanding because some of us use science and the rest use nonsense.

The intruder is obviously disconnected from reality. Listen to the 911 Call. Paul Pelosi understands that he is dealing with a crazy person and is trying to not set him off. Unfortunately the 911 operator didn't fully pick up on that and relay it to the police who made the visit to the house.
It's basically a highly toxic site for years to come (thousands million+ of pounds of Vinyl Choroid, along with other chemicals is not just going to go away, that easy, imo). So I am surprised that Trump is even showing up at that place. But it's also a conservative area that consumes FOX New, Zero Hedge, Alex Jones, etc... So in their mind no one is talking about it and they are being screwed over by Biden/Mayor Pete and not DeWine (who was the one who ordered the tankers to be controlled burned, but I would like to point out that if they didn't do that then it probably would've exploded an caused a much larger environmental/health issues) , DeWine didn't declare a state of emergency when the derailment happened and now he can't access FEMA because of it. But I doubt that anyone told the folks in East Palestine about that. I understand that they are mad but they are mad at the wrong people. Trump has a habit of saying things people want to hear. So I don't doubt he will say Biden is "too afraid" to go to East Palestine and that he won't help them. And oh, Mayor Pete bad. That along with with him claiming the 2020 election was stolen and that if he was in charge he would've done something else (in actuality he would've made it much worse, IMO).

It’s a total sham. I was provided a really shitty ladder to hookup a tv mounted high on a wall at work. The ladder was so light it literally slid out from under me and I fell to the floor and had a compression fracture on my back. I got an ER visit, which included a CT scan and ZERO pain relief from pain I would put on scale of having two simultaneous tooth aches. I also got two visits to a orthopedic doctor which consisted of asking me how I was doing and a reply “let’s see you in a month”. I literally spent 60 seconds or less with the doctor and no actual treatment. The cost for all this……..$43,000.

Consider that the West has crippling economic sanctions in place, that Russian energy Europe needs is quickly being re-sourced (and this winter will be the worst of shortages), that Russia has broken its word on Ukraine so can no longer be trusted with a handshake deal, that the Black Sea would be totally cut off to them with a hostile Ukraine on their border, and there is very little Russia could offer to see those things changed.

It was worker’s comp. But I get to see the worker’s comp registers at work. Even if I am not paying it‘s BS that my employer would be charged that kind of money. I literally could have gone home and laid down for a few weeks and had the same result.

DeSantis? He held a special session to deal with the insurance crisis and instead of dealing with that issue, he turned on Disney and stripped them of self governance and their special tax status. This immediately put a huge debt on the back of local municipalities and will degrade public services in areas where Disney operates and used to provide said services. And he did it because he disagreed with their stated support of LGBTQ people, which just so happens to be a flagrant violation of the first amendment-- using government power to punish someone for their political speech.
..IF the Putin regime will fall, it will be due to an internal collapse due to deteriorating economic conditions afflicting their population. The NATO countries know this. In the meantime, expect more of these headlines about devastation coming out of Ukraine. Additionally, expect Russia to escalate matters in the winter with a strenhened Chinese supplied backing. NATO has to slowly bleed Russia out and the nukes they have become effectively useless.. Putin can't just nuke his own country .. they have over 140 million people to feed. Once Putin can't do that... He will fall.
It's just that, on balance, and particularly taking into account past behaviours, access to the pipeline, and who would benefit the most from it, someone from Russia (not _necessarily_ the Russian government) is by some distance the most likely candidate.

And then what? U overthrow a wolf that keeps other wolf's in check. It will exactly be same as iraq 2.0. On many fold worse scenario. NATO Coalition control all cities but cant control country side. Russia is too vast for an occupation like iraq. And if you leave some radicals will take over a country that has a lot of nukes or has resources to make nukes.
Thereafter, the Russian "peace keeping" mission will have no peace to keep since the Armenians they were sent to protect will no longer exist. With no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh they will merely be seen by the Azeri public as an occupying force. Then Aliyev will cry to the West that the Russians are occupying its internationally recognized territory. Russia might eventually leave with some sort of an economic/financial deal with Azerbaijan and just like that, the dictator in Azerbaijan will have what he always wanted. All of Karabakh.
Little to nothing about this is fearmongering, Azerbaijan has repeatedly, loudly, and clearly stated and acted with force on all of these aims recently, and the commenter is correct in assessing that the geopolitical landscape has shifted such that almost nothing seems to seriously stand in Azerbaijan's way short of the US. Armenians, all Armenians, are in very serious danger now and in the coming months to years.

Exactly. This entire issue/war is a direct result of Joseph Stalin. He's the person solely responsible for placing Nagorno-Karabakh into Soviet Azerbaijan despite the overwhelming majority of it being Armenian (not to mention the historical ties).
I don't knock what sort of thing you whack off to but please don't corrupt my feeble mind with it. I'm into feet, and I'll thank you for respecting that.
Similarly their is a substantial difference in a percentage of the population demanding their elected officials listen to their concerns about doing more to protect the environment, and people protesting violently because they do not have elected officials but are being controlled by another country against their wishes.

There is a substantial difference between allowing the government to enforce laws to marginalize the ability of people to peacefully protest so that the protest is not only heard and can not be ignored, and paramilitary forces killing dozens of civilians in various car bombings leaving hundreds more wounded.

That's kind of the point. A very quick glance at the government of the UK shows just how out of touch they are and how little they represent the people (for instance, think about the percentage of second/third generation immigrans in the country and their representation in either of the houses).

He's a good egg. Everyone on this planet does something dodgy, I bet me and you ain't squeaky clean. People expect these politicians to be such amazing humans it's unreal. I don't give a flying shit if they're the worst human possible as long as they're doing the right thing for the people of the country they're running that's all that matters.
I am Serbian. I don't support our current government. None of my friends support it. I don't support any kind of aggression against anyone. I don't hate Albanians. I do have opinions that are not based on the manipulative media. I believe confessions of people who have been there. Both sides. Let me just tell you that most people living in Serbia don't want war. We have had too much pain and suffering in the past. And we are sick of it. We all just want to live normal lives. We are not fcking animals as many western media portray us. Our economy has suffered terribly because of past wars. We are family people who want to be able to work and live with dignity. When NATO bombs where falling I was 10, my sister 1 year old. We didn't ask for that. We didn't choose Milosevic, and we didn't know what was happening in Kosovo. None of our parents knew. I wish that experience to no one. Please, stop talking about Serbs like we are some kind of enraged beasts that want to go on a killing spree. There is a small group of nationalist extremist idiots in every country. And please understand that you don't get all the information to have such strong opinions against Serbian people. Have you been to Kosovo? Do you know what started the unrest? Do you know what Kosovo special forces where doing in Serbian municipalities fully armed with automatic rifles and snipers? Do you know that they where badgering civilians, confiscating whatever they liked, took away what people needed to survive, destroying their businesses? Those people are poor. Do you know how many attacks on Serbs there where in the last year? How many graveyards and churches have been desecrated? Do you know that Kosovo is a holy ground for Serbs? And now a child aged 11, and his brother 21 where shot while they where taking oak branches to their house on Ortodox Christmas eve that celebrates peace and family. One more Serbian boy was beaten by some Albanians on the next day. How is that OK? They are young boys who should have a right to celebrate their traditions with their families. They are civilian, not military. I do understand that Albanians suffered too. I am not one sided or blind to their suffering. When you loose a member of your family in war that stays with you forever. It happened on both sides. But this crazy revenge... I have no words for it. Those seeds of hate are sowed by politicians. I think it is soo stupid that we let politicians and media manipulate us into hating each other. And please, visit Serbia and meet Serbian people before you judge based on what you hear on the TV. I have been to Albania, and I can only say that they are people just like any other. They live normal lives, and they deeply care about their families just like we do. I wish harm to no one. Stop the hate. Enough of wars.
Serbia’s former province of Kosovo declared independence in 2008 following the 1998-1999 war during which NATO bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, to protect Albanian-majority Kosovo.

. So unless we know both sides of the story it is all going to be speculations.Like the person who claimed in this thread that two people were killed which turned out to be a lie.
If you only see posts there when they hit the front page, where the crazy gets diluted from the Reddit masses weighign in, I'd encourage you to compare that to the 100-200 comment threads about some random crime where only the sub regulars post. It's like night and day.
If we, on a global scale, really do want to fight corruption, then the most important thing we can do isn't actually necessarily the individual reforms or laws - though, yes, those are important - but it's to reform our culture such that corruption is viewed as just generally being not okay for people to do.

1. It is very convenient to blame Russia for everything. The thing is, the root cause of the problems you listed is: lots of people are very stupid. And stupid people create ridiculous conspiracy theories just because they are stupid and have nothing else to do. Adding to that, 2013-2014 invasion of Ukraine (the one noone gave a fuck about) happened during Obama's term, who doesn't seem as a Putin's project.

Even though they have a list of what is missing they may not know the locations which makes it hard to secure a search warrant as you have to list down probable cause that the items would be located there. The reason they got the search warrant for his shitty hotel/golf course is that someone leaked that there were documents there in an unsecured manner.

Of course he is. He IS above the law. According to the judge, he won't be hit with any obstruction charges, any contempt of court charges. They keep letting him skate along without any consequence. Trump probably knows where the documents are, and he is threatening to release them unless he gets what he wants. He is using the documents as bargaining chips and will probably succeed, and no one will have a problem with it.
EU should change it laws widening it's sanctions on Russia since they have been already declared a terrorist state, there are not laws to deal with this problem but somebody should change the law and made some new laws to apply to a terrorist state. Like how it is possible a terrorist state as Russia can have its propagandist flying freely? I still don't understand it.
Romania has a deep hatred for anything russian, my grandmother told me that under russian occupation in the moldavian area they starved while the soldiers stole their food and my grandfather's sister was executed by a russian soldier by a nearby river where they washed the clothes cause she resisted the rape.

> That date was when airline agents in Frankfurt barred many Jewish travelers coming from New York City from boarding their connecting flight to Budapest, citing the fact that some of the passengers were not wearing masks, as was required at the time. But that rule was applied inconsistently, passengers said at the time, and a Lufthansa supervisor was caught on video speaking disparagingly about Jewish passengers as a group.
Exactly. If you have 16 black people waiting to get on a plane, and 3 of them are being assholes, you revoke the boarding privileges of the 3 assholes and allow the other 13 blacks to board. That is not racist. If three of them are being assholes, and you decide that all 16 of these black people are taking the bus now because 3 of them are being assholes, that is racist, and this particular incident was anti-semitic.

Already seeing the usual intentionally misunderstanding comments. A minority of people refused to wear masks so an entire group was kicked off including those wearing masks. That’s a bullshit policy.
We've seen them trying to prepare defences there the last few weeks ands there the rumors of an imminent advance by Ukraine due to happen sometime in near future to punch through to the Sea of Azov and cut the Russian land bridge, liberate Melitopol and the ZNPP and take back the rest of Kherson Oblast.

Good read. Any report from within Russia confirming what Ukraine and Western intelligence agencies are reporting is good. Disregarding this guys political views and his comments about Ukraine bombaring civilians in Donetsk, he otherwise knows what he is talking about.
The Russians we occasionally interacted with in Eve Online (internet spaceships) certainly understood the concept.

The Iranian regime spent many years building terrorist organizaitons and cells throughout the world to frighten its enemies from retaliating on its soil (this is also why they seek nuclear weapons), this caused this false sense of security which you and others may have had but you aren't safe because of its power, you are (or were) safe because Iran's shenanigans weren't significant enough to warrant said countries to smack you directly and risk escalations.

Iran's main foes that have capable militaries (Israel and the US, as opposed to KSA for example) were always able to strike Iran if it escalates to full war, the main thing that they focused on were shadow wars, attacks that stay below the threshold of escalation to war, attacks that allow plausible deniability like "oh it was just a gas leak explosion, not an attack", assassinations and sabotage.

No country is going to invade you, it would be a nightmare even for the US, but you are in risk of suffering massive bombardments and significant sabotage to main infrastructure in case of war, you're luck is that unlike Iran, its opponents not only have far greater precision weapons but their doctrines of warfare hope to minimize damage to civilians and focus on military/regime infrastructure, so you should be relatively safe.

There is. They typically call center right or conservatives fascist for not adhering to new leftist ideas like white privilege. Anyone who doesn’t agree is labeled a fascist, racist, or something else. When really it’s a show of non conformity and critical thinking.

4. This is obviously drone footage from Ukraine. So it very well could have been both. The drone is an artillery spotter, so if those cars weren't moving, they would have been blasted by the M777 gun team paired up with that drone.

Virtually unlimited. The lives mean nothing to them. Destroying expensive equipment and physically throwing them out and quarantining them from decent people is the path to victory. I really believe we could hit 500k and they would still fawn over Putin and would still want the war.

exactly. Actual restricted networks are physicall isolated with thier own routing, backbone and dark fibre connectivity, the only stuff they expose to the web is public portals for a few small things. and killing those entry ways is just blokcing external access, not the actual network itself or any of the services hte network uses.
My 8th grade history teacher told us this when we were learning about the first ebola outbreak that happened in the 70s. Scared the shit out of me as a kid.
no it’s not, i’m from Nigeria and we’ve seen what not taking vaccines can do, vaccines are government funded and at times completely compulsory, i’ve taken close to 15 different shots since i turned 10 (i’m 19 and i can’t even count the number i took as a child, they literally come into the schools and vaccinate the kids, then register them because most diseases require more than one shot, they also go house to house and mark the houses they’ve gone to so you really have no choice) i’ve taken multiple vaccines for meningitis, yellow fever, hepatitis, covid, polio etc, i wish american vaccine deniers would just come to Africa lol, the diseases that’d kill them wouldn’t even have to work hard, 3 days max but then again they can’t even visit, our embassy won’t give a visa without proof of a yellow fever shot.

Hi Lionel54321. Your submission from reuters.com is behind a registration wall. A registration wall limits the number of free articles users can access before they are required to register an account to log in to continue reading it. While your submission was not removed, users are discouraged from upvoting it or commenting on it.
The issue with those books is they arbitrarily assume that we either improve not a single step beyond where we currently are, or that we regress as a fear response to the unknown. More than that, they outright state that everyone else in existence is just as bad, or worse, than us. To the point that humanity briefly working alongside and in peace with the aliens, even though we could only do so by putting the metaphorical gun to their head, was so bizarre and unusual that higher tech species were watching us as side entertainment from their own infinite wars, waiting (correctly) for it all to fall apart once again and justify their own genocidal actions.
Have you read the bible? The bible very proudly emphasizes that they killed every man, woman, and child of a particular tribe, and praised God for it. Then another tribe. Then another tribe. The list is quite long. They are proud of it and praise God!

Another more recent example was the extensive reporting by every major network about young people “not wanting to work” in which they never ever challenged the claims of the business owners they interviewed, nor did they put in the 20 minutes of work needed to compare what these entities were actually paying people to either local cost of living or working conditions.
Yup. And ever since he got his God Complex (a loooong time ago), he is using his brain for nefarious and selfish acts.
Seriously. I have been particularly well informed on the issue since just before they started Cast Lead. NYT coverage is actually particularly bias in favor of Israel - not quite as ignant as Bill Mahr (gd, that dude doesn't even realize how racist he is) when it comes to issues involving Palestinians, but hey, who is?

How's Israel an ethnostate? 25 precent of israelis are Arabs with full rights the same Rights Jews get , the law says that Israel is culturally Jewish but not just Jewish . Also seems your problem is with the only Jewish state and not with the 22+ Arab ethnostates or European ethnostates, heck Japan is also an ethnostate but your problem is with a country that is isn't a ethnostate , your just a hypocrite.

Seem your problem is not with the ethnostate part but with the Jewish part , I don't see you condem the actual ethnostates in the middle east just the Jewish country.
Over 20 million Russians died in WW2 and Russia is still kicking. Even if there are hundreds of thousands dead in Ukraine Russia isnt going anywhere. If what you guys are saying is how it worked then so many countries would've just been wiped off the map. Man I wonder how civilization recovered after the black death, or the 30 years war where HALF THE POPULATION of a country(HRE) died. Or that time the Spanish flu killed 100 million people on top of WW1 killing 40 million. Hmmmm.
Ukraine exports about 17.3 million tonnes of wheat (5 in the world). For comparison, Russia is 1 with 33m and US is 2 with 27.3m. By adding Ukraine, Russia dramatically increases its wheat export by about 50% which would be the dominant exporter by far. This means they can also manipulate wheat prices considering their market share.

Exactly. Can't think of anyone even Russians^ would trust less to deliver on something like that than the Putin regime after its well-publicised screwing over of soldiers when it came to promised payments.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$15.5 million to victims' families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.\[63\] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.\[64\] Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.\[65\] The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Saro-Wiwa's son, was due to begin in New York.\[64\].
Good. Documentaries have many times displayed the kind of destruction the oil folks have caused in areas of Nigeria - seemingly ignored by corrupt officials etc.
I think you have the answer to that given how little Covid was mentioned in the recent elections. Democrats stayed away from talking about it, here in NY the GOP tried to some degree to use school closures as a talking point, but really that was it. Nobody was running with a platform that involved talking about protections against Covid or the like. By 2024 Covid will still be talked about, but just as one of many circulating illnesses alongside RSV, flu, pneumonia etc. Heck, it's already kind of reached that state.
I'm having trouble finding the exact quote, but it was something along the lines of people "losing their private health insurance" as a result of single payer and presenting it as if that is an actual loss rather single payer eliminating the need for that parasitic industry. It was, to me, fear-mongering. I don't mind honest debates about the cost or the efficacy or whatever about universal healthcare vs. private, but I'm sick of Democrats not representing the case fairly.

But I'm still angry at him for undermining the case for universal healthcare in the primary debates, and I'd prefer someone else run in 2024. He is not bold enough to handle the mounting difficulties this country faces.

and we're going to be bringing Kevin McCarthy, my Kevin, and Elon Musk, he could've been nicer to me but that's ok, they're gonna be doing a Strong Meeting, not as strong as I would but still pretty strong, and they're talking about how we can stop the Radical Left from Rigging 2024, like they always do, they haven't been elected fairly since Andrew Jackson, one of the only good ones, he was a Democrat, not a lot of people know that, and they said to me, "Sir, you're even better than Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe," and I said even without the Big Hat they said, "yes, Sir, you're the greatest, even better than Washinon," can you believe it, I won President on the first try, nobody gets it, and Crooked Hillary tried to Rig it hard, and she was mean and above all she was vicious but she still couldn't stop my Incredible Campaign, ever since I came down, had your Beautiful First Lady, you all know who I'm talking about, even the Fake News was there, we had many many millions for Trump, I had more votes than all of the other Presidents, 82 Billion, they said, and we're talking these are good looking Army Soldiers, better looking than Patrick Swayze, and they're coming up, tears in their eyes, "thank you Sir for saving us from Obama," I said it's not a problem, it's what I do, I'm too good ok, you have, just the other day I saw Pocahontas, she was all over the Fake News saying how she wants you all to pay even more Taxes than the Horrible Taxes put upon us all, very unfairly by the way, from Sleepy Joe and probably Crooked Hillary too. don't forget, I came in, "Sir, we're out of Bullets," I said what happened, "it's Obama, Sir, he sent them to Iran," I said how nice, here you had Absolute Perfection under Trump and then the Radical Left comes and shuts down the Banks and the Churches, we're going to have a Great Democrat Recession just wait and see, they'll be saying a hundred years from now how badly Sleepy Joe did with our Once Great Country. ok, I have to do some very important things, you can thank me now, thank me later, whatever you want, ok you're welcome.
> In this particular case, the comment "Hopefully not an [Object object]!" is a humorous way of saying that the object in question should not be mistakenly referred to as Object in this context. The follow-up comment "You need to use its toString() method, clearly they haven't thought of this" is making a joke about a common solution to this issue, which is to use the toString() method to explicitly convert the object to a string representation.

Yeah, I consider multiple direct witnesses across an entire county, and multiple direct victims that consist of entire families who claimed to have both witnessed and experienced abductions, to be wide (both literally and figuratively).

Loads of sightings across an entire county, direct experiences of multiple families who experienced an abduction at the same time.
Do you mean safety from sexual violence? \7.2% of Swedish Women reported being exposed to a sexual offense in their lifetime (self-reporting = more accurate measure of sexual violence than court convictions), while American women self-reporting as victims tops \%20.
Why? Who cares? Never in my life have I heard of a person running into any problems with this, but you can never open the newspaper without some politician or other person in power getting caught recieving money from a person who he later gave a big contract to, like the current prime minister who recieved an apartment from a corporation who he sold a bunch of socialised housing to for a cheap price. He would NEVER be caught unless someone close to him ratted him out. But even then, how would they find out? All those documents are classified.

Not necessarily. I don’t know the wording of the Colombian law, but Involuntary manslaughter would classify as killing them and not be considered murder.
Remember the main thing about modern propaganda isn't patriotic songs or posters or nationalistic sentiments, it's not about convince you to change your mind directly. It's poisoning the well everywhere else and making you distrust your peers, government, and neighbors. Once the tipping point is reached and the natural problems of a country are amplified, it takes very little poking to keep it going. The vast majority of the trolling and propaganda is automated, and there's plenty of human supervised efforts as well. A dirt poor Russian country kid with a computer can bring his family out of poverty doing this shady business online. All Putin or any dictator needs is to be able to point at America and say "See, it's not so bad here, look at them." You don't free a country with landmines. You don't invade a country to liberate them. It really is that simple and blatant.
Interesting video. I had not heard Tom Snyder speak before. And thanks for your thoughts on r/conservative. There is only so many times you can try to fight the good fight until you realize it is pointless. Take care.
I am far more concerned amount the tens of millions of voters who can neither admit Trump was ever wrong nor admit that they were wrong for supporting Trump.

and I got there first, way ahead of Sleepy Joe, he didn't even want to go to East Palestine, my favorite Palestine, the others have a lot of problems, but they love Trump there so you know it's a great place, and I gave them Lifesaving Supplies, Biden has given them nothing, here I am, right after it happened, being Presidential when Sleepy Joe is on an Overseas Luxury Vacation, can you believe it, he must be tired from all the Golf he's been playing, remember I never had time for Golf, but I love it and it loves me, but I never had time as President, I was too busy doing deals, I did Veterans, I did Tax Cuts, the largest we've ever seen by the way, even better than Reagan. Ronald Reagan, he used to be called The Gipper, not a lot of people know that.
Iirc the US army actually tried to get extra funding from Congress for research into green energy because they deemed that relying on countries like Saudi Arabia was not a reliable source of energy and a national security risk.
And then what? Let's think about the situation here: The EU's has been fairly consistent over the past decade () so to no one's surprise that means renewables are replacing some of the existing fossil fuel power plants. Subsidies cover part of the cost of construction, generation, and maintenance and they sell all of the power that gets generated to customers for money. If there's a power deficit due to a lower "capacity factor" they have to make it up by spending even more of their money to build more renewables which further eats into their profit margins. Based on the numbers above that's an effective power generation rate of 7%. I don't know about you but frankly I don't see how that is a winning proposition even if there were massive subsidies.

Yep, limiting women’s rights and Fuck over the Democrats, two items on their list. They are good, no idea why anyone is complaining. /s.
Now I think the Republicans are absolute shit and I don't give a fuck about dress codes too, but this is you general clickbait outrage "news" set to divide people by pretending it has made the situation worse for women than it is for men when it has just brought their dress code closer to the restrictive level that the mens code has always been at.

Thank you. It’s pretty disappointing that I had to scroll this far past all of the rage to see a reasonable take like this. I’m a democrat and I’m used to republicans doing shitty things, so my knee jerk reaction to the headline was pretty negative, but then I actually read the article and saw that the men’s dress code was already very restrictive. It’s still a pretty stupid law but context matters.

That has been like this for years and has happened quite a few times. Also, Demos are not forbidden because of political reasons (a judge would be removed from office immediately), but because it's a hazard that can't be controlled ,the police has not enough people or other reasons like that...
There. I fixed it for you. Modern human civilization can not function without hydrocarbons. I'm all for transitioning to renewables (+ nuclear), but it's nowhere near close to replacing hydrocarbons. transition is going to take a long time if we want to do it without collapsing the current system. There is no other way.

It’s subsidising fossil fuels by € 17,5 bn yearly, not meeting binding targets (like the Paris Accord) and ignoring court orders to protect their citizens from climate change (Urgenda), not to speak of other environmental issues like nitrogen (again that had to come to the high court).

P.S. if you want to be green, using less energy in general is the single best way to save carbon. Your electric SUV is not making anything better.

Regulation also drives corruption. Look at the FDA and Pfizer. It’s blatantly obvious some things were ignored to get the approval. The fact the public can’t see trial data for 70 years for something we were all pretty much forced to put into our bodies by our employers is pretty wrong.

Anarchists are anti corporation. If they disagree with libertarians in such a fundamental way then there's no getting along.
Swiss banks profited from the Jews gold, Switzerland made some hard decision, you can say even some wrong one (keep in mind that it's easy to judge after the facts, much harder when you must take those decisions with a war at your doors), but using cherry picked events and facts decontestualized to spread hate is really wrong, even more if done without actually knowing what you are talking about.
Just say anything. Nothing you just said was relevant to anything I said. You just threw a complete straw man to avoid admitting that if you want to deny humanitarian products you are a POS. Did you think attempting to marginalize me by being snarky and throwing out ridiculous sarcastic things like Illuminati was brilliant on your part? Weak, bro.

Like bringing up the holocaust in a post about drugs sales, while I brough up the US, and everyone else because, guess what, they sells drugs to Russians too (Switzerland follow exactly the same EU sanctions) and is hypocritical to decontestualize an article just to spread hate on one nation while closing the eyes to the others... You understand?
The USSR was formidable. Then the kleptocracy set in and everyone has been trying to steal as much as possible ever since. Most didn't think they'd ever need it. They felt the reputation of Russia was enough. I seriously doubt their nuks even work, they're massively expensive (lots to steal there) and if they really needed them, it would already be the end of the world anyway. Now, all the good stuff is gone and they have an army with nothing but leftover crap, if there's anything left at all. All that self enriching has put Russia into a dire position that could likely bring the end. There's a lot of sharks just waiting.
FWIW: Ukraine has stated that if you surrender and are used for an exchange (which is optional), they will declare you captured or injured in battle (depending on your situation), exactly to avoid them getting prosecuted once they get back.

Slim to none. There have been reports that Putin was "persuaded" to start the war by men in his inner circle, and at least Patrushev (a pretty likely successor) is definitely an even more unhinged fascist than Putin.

Four years ago, Fernando Arredondo was sitting on a plane with his arms shackled, waiting for the U.S. government to deport him to Guatemala, which he had fled with his family after his teenage son was murdered.
For Arredondo, being given the rare chance to live in the U.S. permanently was an odds-defying culmination to a dizzying years-long journey that began with his son's tragic death and included separations, months in detention, a debilitating deportation and an unlikely return to America.

When Arredondo was recently told by his lawyer that his family had won asylum in the U.S., he said he immediately thought about the forced separation from Andrea and his deportation — a period in which he lost weight, developed a urinary tract infection and fell into a deep depression.

Once Trump saw in 2020 that he was tanking in the polls he had to invent his visibly false attack on our working election system. There was little extra risk in exposing himself to criminal liability in pursuing a coup. This is because once he was no longer president all of his stunning levels of fraud became more actionable and he knew he would go down anyway. He is losing enough of what support he still had that he stands almost no chance of winning even the nomination. Even a few hardcore Trump nuts balk at supporting a guy once it is no longer remotely deniable that he is a massive crook. Who knew? Oh yeah. Everybody with decent decision-making who ever looked at his career.

No. He's not obligated to reward billionaires for anti-labor practices. Sorry. You're more than welcome to move to Texas and work for him but Elon isn't giving anyone any indication that he's acting in good faith and his unstable behavior does him no favors. Please stop. It's sad.

Musk’s megalomania aside, it would behoove all the manufacturers to standardize on a single charging system and really to standardize onto battery footprints, which would allow the battery swap stations to get off the ground.

Really? Seems like you're just making stuff up. He didn't want to involve Tesla because of their extensive history of anti-labor practices. Elon treats his workers like shit.

Legitimately. Fetterman looks like he could be an extra on season two of The Wire. People who are blue collar are gonna connect with that. When he says he knows what you’re going through, you believe it because he looks like he went through it. Most politicians come across as to polished and privileged.

Exactly. He fought for his seat and took shots at Oz. If a candidate is willing to fight for a seat, maybe that candidate will fight for for things for their constituents and won't just cower under republican chiding.

Exactly. North Carolina for example the party anointed Cheri Beasley over Jeff Jackson. No one was excited to vote for Beasley and the republican candidate Ted Budd who has the personality of a brown paper bag easily won.

Plus the Russian tanks really stink inside from all the vodka farts and pants shitting that has occured. The Ukrainians need nice Chanel No. 5 scented interiors.
I mean, yes you are right. This is more like a RC. I was referring to the actual definition of a tank. This can be considered a light tank, due to weight class and main gun. Sweden's Stridsvagn are modern, and still considered tank destroyers despite the term not being used for a while. Anyway nice chat! i can see you know your stuff.

In addition, Soviet designs are apparently very maintenance heavy, and actual Russian produced vehicles have been revealed to have severe quality issues. The maintenance part in particular has come back to haunt Russian forces, as a lack of maintenance for decades resulted in much of their armored forces breaking down, both prior to combat and being abandoned once in or near it. NATO designs, in contrast, don't have the quality issue and have been kept maintained even if the vehicles were sitting in warehouses. And as an added bonus, having NATO hardware can help easing into NATO standardization when Ukraine begins to attempt to join NATO, thanks to the Russian invasion.
These “originalists” or “traditionalists” have no idea how insane they sound. What does this mean to be an “originalist”, simply that they wish to uphold the constitution exactly as they think the “founding fathers” intended for it to be. Now, who’s side do you think they would have been on during the revolutionary war. The people revolting “the americans” or “the british”? Well, as “originalists” most likely they would have wanted to keep the status quo and would have wanted to honor the people in charge, not the people trying to change things for the better. You can see a correlation here with religion as well. Who’s side would these same people have been on had they lived during “jesus” life. The man making trouble and looking for change, or the law as it stood. Of course they would have been yelling “crucify him” along with the rest of the rabble. So here now in modern times we have religious originalists, as I called them “traditionalists”, who are now faced with change and what do they want to do, keep the status quo. They have no idea of the irony they are living through as the defenders against change, against people that they so pretend to admire. The “founding fathers” were revolutionaries, “jesus” was a revolutionary and these people are exactly the types they were fighting against. Hypocrisy could not be any clearer.

Manufacture consent. If you watched the AMA awards or the Grammy's you will notice it is all the same. The artists are the same and interchangeable. The auto tune is everywhere and most of them can't play an instrument. Its all about influencers created and destroyed by the companies. Ticketmaster and live nation control the stages, the artists and the sales.

Current inflation? No competition with Always Late(tm) inventory. What are you gonna do when I increase my price? Switch? Competitors can't take the business because they have the same upstream monopoly supplier who can't increase their production.
Eisenhower prioritzed spending govt money on the freeway system instead of a publicly available rail transport, we still suffer from poor road conditions and increasing road congestion. Sure, yes Eisenhower did good things. He also got involved with Vietnam Civil War and did nothing to stop the Korean War (it's still technically ongoing due to NO peace treaty signed), then we wasted trillions of dollars on Vietnam. Another Republican admin forms, we waste more trillions on Iraq, Afghanistan on baselss WMD lies. Republicans are crying about "money going to Ukraine" while THEY are the ones who started wars overseas and spent trillions. Then they complain about the drug cartels in Mexico and open border but don't legalize drugs so the cartels don't make as much money when the substances are illegal. These are problems created by the GOP has made to stifle and blame the Democrats. The drug war, like other wars, has always been about money; nothing to do with public health or family values whatever that means to them.

But one thing is absolutely certain, if India had favoured the US government over Russian in the past 50 years, we'd be beyond fucked as a nation. Now this doesn't have to mean "Russia good, US bad", Russia is absolutely clean white underwear with a massive shitstain of a government for what they're doing in Ukraine and Putin definitely deserves to die for what he's done not only to the Ukrainians, but to the poor Russian soldiers who were forced into the war without proper training, gear or knowledge of what they were being asked to do.
If you say so. That sounds like a set of typical libright talking points to me. There are philosophical disagreements about whether humans are inherently greedy, but Marx says the system needs to be strong enough to constrain the greed and place those without at the top. Also, you're right. Communist countries struggle to integrate into the capitalist interconnected global economy. That's why ideally ever nation would be Communist. That would also stop tax evaders.
I'll shout this for the cheap seats again... CONGRESS PASSED THE LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDED PPP LOANS That is why they happened. That is why they are legal. That is why they aren't being/can't be challenged in a court of law. The legality and procedure behind the PPP program and that behind the student loan forgiveness plan is entirely different and done by two different branches of the federal government and why the student loan plan is challenged and will fail. Congress has the power to allocate/spend money; the executive branch has no such power. And if you want to tie that to the PPP loans being unfair/failing then you need to point your little finger of blame at congress.
Not necessarily. If the Supreme Court allows the Texas ruling to stand, it opens up the government to be sued for basically every program they have. I don't see the SC blocking the relief for going through.

By literally disregarding any understanding of legal standing. A 1L from a half-decent program could explain why none of the plaintiffs should be able to present a case.
Edit: I used blanket because it matched up with "interwoven" and in my head I pictured a shit stained ball of yarn. I suppose you could use mittens or booties instead.
In 1542, the establishment of the Roman Catholic Inquisition effectively restrained secular courts under its influence from liberal application of torture and execution. The methodological Instructio, which served as an "appropriate" manual for witch hunting, cautioned against hasty convictions and careless executions of the accused. In contrast with other parts of Europe, trials by the Venetian Holy Office never saw conviction for the crime of malevolent witchcraft, or "maleficio". Because the notion of diabolical cults was not credible to either popular culture or Catholic inquisitorial theology, mass accusations and belief in Witches' Sabbath never took root in areas under such inquisitorial influence.

2. Western govt making statements only help the mullah regime's narrative that protests are a foreign conspiracy. If Iranians want to overthrow the mullahs, they'll have to do it on their own, like successful revolutions in other parts of the world. Foreign assisted revolutions lack legitimacy.

Trump will outdo himself next year in ways previously thought impossible. 18 months from now when the Capitol is literally on fire or worse, Zuckerberg himself will re-ban Trump permanently and implement the sort of progressive, pre-emptive content moderation policy that we want and enough highly-paid moderators to do it. He will personally dial the AI away from aggressive, violent engagement and to something closer to broadcast television.

Hi Total_Customer_6627. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
A bit like the 2004 American presidential election when it was felt that staying the course with an unqualified leader (and particularly military leader) was a better option for Iraq and Afghanistan than a decorated war hero who was not a miserable failure (though I'm sure we now all long for the benevolent idiocy of the bush years).
13 out of 60.... So I guess I was wrong, it's closer to 80% that dislike Hezbollah.... They are not one of the most popular party. Lebanon has an antiquated sectarian voting system, where different religions are represented "proportionally" and most parties are sectarian. Hezbollah is one of 2 Shiite Muslim parties, so they get a high proportion of the Shiite vote. Sunni Muslim, Druze, Maronites, Orthodox, etc. each have their own political parties. The high fragmentation of the government effectively gives almost any party with more than 5 seats the ability to veto legislation (similar to the hyper representation in Israeli politics allowing fringe parties with few seats to dictate legislation for the governing party). Again, complicated. Lebanon is not equal to Hezbollah, despite what the media want to push.
Don't underestimate it. Being able to rapidly reverse engineer and produce high end equipment is still a hell of a an advantage. Even if they are lower quality, the logistics and manufacturing ability is still scary. And the more they do it and learn the more they improve their industry and skill set and come up with original and superior designs.

and there I was, sitting there, very innocently by the way, had your Beautiful First Lady, you all know who I'm talking about, and all of a sudden I see my people, they're coming up to me, "Sir, Sir," I said what is it, "it's the Radical Left, Sir, they're trying to get Allen to flip," and we don't like Flippers do we folks, and I know a lot about it, I've been watching it happen for a long time, you have people who are maybe good people and then some things happen, we're talking bad things, and then they're maybe not so good, and then there are what you would call some problems, and we never have problems under Trump, but then you look at what's going on, Sleepy Joe stealing your Taxes and using it for Late Term Abortions, it's horrible what they're doing. we used to be over 100% under Trump but now, now we're Dead In The Water, ok, you can thank me whenever you feel like it, have a nice time, don't forget, you wouldn't have a Constitution without me.

Prosecutorial discretion shouldn’t include ignoring provable crimes, no matter the overarching benefit. The law ought to be followed by everyone, all of the time, equally, or else society, especially risk-seeking sociopaths, will rightfully treat the law as optional. And would you look at that, the man who held the highest office in the land continues to have utter contempt for the law, precisely because the people responsible for upholding the law in America are either feckless or contemptible.
What does the EU benefit from sanctioning China over Xinjiang though? Europe isn’t Turkic so its not ethnic kinship, and the Uyghurs don’t really have anything to give Europe that China can’t already give. Sure antagonism can benefit American hegemony but thats not exactly European hegemony. Honestly this whole thing feels like a moralism.

I'm not optimistic but I truly hope that this is just a vocal minority of people raised on shock jock humor disguised as politics and that they are willing to take the party back from those who are trying to destroy the government and Civil Society under the false auspice of patriotism.
Okay you want some of his actions? How about the time he wouldn't listen to the experts in cave diving and wanted to build a super sub to get the children out? When he was rebuked he went on to call one of the divers of pedophile on social media. How's that for a good person?

I really miss being able to have conversations about policy and actual governance rather than the( monuments designed as comedy routines that have become so commonplace under the guidance of Steve bannon, Donald trump, and the entire corporate Republican opinion programming octopus that exploit naive True Believers on both sides of the political Spectrum by filling the entire conversation space without rage for the sake of distraction.

Thta's not how bipolar works at all. My mom and my uncle are bipolar and it didn't cause this level of crazy. This is far right evangelical brainwashing more than anything. Manic bipolar might explain how often he posts but not what he posts.

”I hear the critics and the phony fake news media that I have a TRANSACTUAL relational with my daughter Ivanka. But you didn’t hear it from me. I don’t want TRANS anything. Okay? Very simple. I’m not into the trans. I don’t believe in it. And how could I? To my own daughter? The gorgeous light of her mothers full bodied figure? No I don’t Transact with anyone and especially not my own family. But I hear a lot about someone who very much does and is into TRANSacting and they want to do it to you and your kids and your lifestyle. We all know the big bad trifecta of TRANS this and that. Don’t we folks? Richard Gere, The Pope— and folks let’s be honest okay? The pope we see the pope they show you? That isn’t the pope. I’m talking about the REAL pope locked in a chamber one thousand and fifty seven feet below the Vatican. I read about all of it in this documentary I watched on a flight from Mar A Lago to West Mar a Lago. But anyways folks, the REAL POPE, and Flea from the Red Hot Chilis. There okay? You have it.

Absolutely. He looked down on Charles Kushner for getting caught and doing time. Trump walks this line between being a buffoon and a savant so well it's not a mistake.
Well I can't dipsute a negative. Until you provide a distinction about what is virtuous about witholding democracy or what is virtuous about not letting yourself change your mind. Then there isn't really much to discuss. Though were you to come up with a reason as to why I have a feeling it would just be for the sake of the counterfactual. Some need to defend stubborness rather than accept it's a good thing to allow Scotland a democratic vote.
So the alternative for the North - and Scotland until the SNP - was to vote Labour. But the problem is. How do you convince the South East to vote for a Labour party when their public spending is already pretty good? Labour needs to run on a manifesto in the North/Scotland of improving our neglected public services. But they already get that in the South East. So they want lower taxes or even public spending cuts. They've got theirs screw paying for improving the rest of the country. So Labour is in a position where they can at best offer liberal or even slightly conservative manifestos to win an election. If they get to progressive then the Conservatives/right-wing and Liberal Democrats/Centre-right sweep up those South Eastern seats that they need to form a majority. And we end up with a decade of austerity and shite growth.

But yeah, surprisingly, actual countries, with their own foreign policy, own militaries, and own heads of state, and their own currencies, have a greater ability to make unilateral decisions than semi autonomous regions of said countries, which have no foreign policy, no foreign relations, no independent currency, no military, and not even entirely independent elections.

Generally speaking, states aren’t allowed to unilaterally seceded. The Americans famously had a bit of a war about it.
- French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said Thursday that Paris has suspended plans to take in 3,500 refugees currently in Italy and called on "all the participants" in the EU's migrant relocation mechanism to adopt similar measures after Rome refused to assign a port of safety to the Ocean Viking.
What disgusting condition? No asylum seeker complaint in italy for poor diet or lack of foods. Heated rooms, TV and volunteering staff even entertaining children. Uk recently was mentioned for inadequate foods for asylum seeker/immigrants. But all Europe is not uk. I have never seen italy or Spain starving the immigrants who arrive on the boats. If it would be as bad as you say, they would never reach for help in Europe. But I agree it is true thst some cou tries offer inadequate diet. I believe something needs to be done urgently. Europe is not as big as it looks on the map. We do need immigration for jobs, workforce. They need to be supported, educated so they can live and prosper in their countries. Legal immigration is welcome, i doubt anyone would object to it. Or people fleeing the war. But trust me, a few of them look for an comfortable easy way out.
I think a good analysis of the issue starts with knowing that there’s no “both sides”. There’s a million groups with different interests. On the Palestinian side, there’s at least two governments calling the shots with the PA and Hamas, and within that there’s a hell of a lot of factionalism and foreign interests. Ditto on the Israeli “side” — Israel is currently in a major ongoing political crisis and one way the far right can claw at more power is by fearmongering about Palestine and installing more aggressive policy. Compromise becomes hard the more interests that are involved, and the fact is there are political interests in both Palestine and Israel for whom peace is more inconvenient. Not to mention that it’s difficult to see a way out — what kind of solution would all of these interests accept at this point, not to mention society at large? The peace accords at Oslo took years of work, great timing, and committed governments who were in control, and we don’t have any of those right now.
Absolutely false. The US did the Natives waaaaaaay worse than Israel could ever do with Palestinians. I’m sure the Palestinians could read the treaties fine, and there’s no basis to assume Israel wouldn’t keep to their treaty obligations.

Territory is disputed; however, settlement expansion isn’t helping. At the same time, both Gaza and the West Bank are run by terrorists and corruption (respectively). So, even without settlement expansion, the ruling parties in Gaza/WB are at best incapable of sustaining peace w Israel or at worst completely unwilling to accept peace. The latter is explicitly stated by Hamas who haven’t held elections since they took power in 2006. They’ve murdered any Palestinian challenging their rule.
extremely naïve of you to think that a common "distaste for US global dominance" is a trivial unifying factor amongst the BRICS nations. perhaps you didn't even read the article i linked above, nor the quote i pulled from that article that says "If accepted, the new proposed BRICS members would create an entity with a GDP 30% larger than the United States, over 50% of the global population and in control of 60% of global gas reserves." that is far from trivial and I hardly believe these nations would announce their application into BRICS publicly if they thought it was doomed to fail.
Certainly. Now, I wasn't born nor am I currently wealthy so I've already got a snowballs chance in hell. Next, I'd be fighting for consumer rights which means zero corporate support so I'm DOA. Would just be another random no name who submitted paperwork to run for President. The problem is those who want the power of the Presidency don't deserve it and those who could wield it responsibly don't want it. You need a Cincinnatus or equal statesman who would wield the executive branch for the true good of the people, country and mankind.
We have a chair here who talks a big talk about investing in rural areas, but what she really means is we should wait for the DNC to start caring about rural, deep red states and when that happens and the money arrives, then we start investing in rural areas/counties…until then we kind of just do the basics. We’ve been hearing this pitch for years.
Ultimately, it’s important to remember about Ohio that Union democrats are the only reason it ever went blue and until the Dems start focusing on unions again those people will vote red on social issues, but that Ryan laid out a good roadmap while ultimately being an unpopular candidate that still outperformed the rest of the party here.

1. Here is the livestream of the first round of drawing (which brought the applicants down from about 10k to the 200 semi-finalists). Out of the \10k applicants, 60D, 60R, and 80I were randomly drawn to go to the semi-final round.

I guess it is useless for me to show you the tens of thousands of dead people that were brutally killed and tortured by the Shah and his secret police (SAVAK) since you would ignore those human rights abuses as long as people can go to drag shows. Disgusting and despicable mindset.
Well.... They are educated. I suppose it depends on how you define "armed." Putting little holes in people is just one of myriad ways to kill them. This isn't the first attempt the youth of Iran have made and I wouldn't be surprised if they start getting creative.

"Have you heard of this magic black juice called fossil fuels? Wait, don't call us fossils--that's not nice!".
My answer is, we make a rapid transition to renewables a priority so we can leave them behind and happily ignore their protestations and political leverage/positions, including on focusing too early on carbon capture to their benefit.

True. Because no one has the courage or money to fight them. Things will go on as such until the world is a cinder or drowned from melting ice caps. A few of them, almost eight billion of us...hmmm. I wonder what we could do?? 🤔.

Even if you run a carbon capture device on a green energy system, you are putting that green energy system to waste in your mission to reduce carbon dioxide emmissions, as that green energy could have been use to reduce emmissions directly, and more efficiently, instead. Because you are now using that green energy for this carbon capture, somewhere else in the world, someone is going to need to use fossil fuels to compensate.

No, carbon capture can only mathematically, at least in current circumstances, contribute to greenhouse gas emmissions.

Are you insane? Profits from oil and g as sales don't exactly go into R&D for renewables (save a tiny fraction which they're doing purely for PR reasons).
The Ayatollah and regime would like to distract the unhappy masses protesting about the innocent killings of citizens by reminding them how much they hate America.
Wasn’t much retaliation. I remember seeing a missle that looked like a burning trash can on the news launched at our base in Iraq. Trump came out after this to say Iran is standing down. If Iran would of killed our troops, it might of been different. Then Iraq shot down the commercial airline a day later and this conflict-retaliation went away.

Operation Praying Mantis. Lol, we also destroyed a few oil platforms as well. When a Soviet ship showed up we asked what they were doing and they said they were just there to take pictures. All because one of our ships was damaged by one of their mines.

If they wanted to be separated they had their opportunities, what do you mean 22 percent of iran are not iranain how is that a thing, and also entire Qajar dynasty were Azeri , Karim Khan zand was Lor ،Reza shah was mazani , current leader of iran is Azeri and they ruled all of Iran , I'm Azeri, I have kord friends , i have lor friends, i have arab friends and my entire family and childhood friends are Azeri and I see not a single on of them as separatists infact they love Iran in some degree.

The airliner had a quirky story too. I’ll take a shot at remembering, the plane took off and had to return to the airport, and the missle defense SAMs (on high alert because of the Americans) detected the returning plane as an inbound missle. Boom, the plane full of Ukrainians (and others) dead.

All of those minority you mention above are part of iran for so many years , we have pharse in iran we called they've become iranize , iran isn't about just language or religion , it's a identity, I suggests you study Iranshahr or Irenshehr theory to help you out more.as you mention Kordish independent state it's because of so many years of government suppression that minority of kord peoples seek independence and again history proves that majority of them doesn't want to become separated.

1) The military (and wars). Holy smokes the US has spent crazy amounts of money on military hardware. Almost certainly way too much. And then even more money was dumped into wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2003 invasion of Iraq spent somewhere over a billion dollars, just on cruise missiles. And that's not even a rounding error on the total cost of the war, which was several trillion dollars.
Israel and the US actually get a lot from each other. Israel is incredibly technologically advanced and has many startups that are commonly bought by large chip makers/tech companies. Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, Amazon, have all done that, among many more. Israel is a world leader in chip development, the current ARM revolution is really happening, because of Israeli companies. Same with computer security/chip level defenses, which Israel is ahead of most of the world. US buys exploits from them as well as they have strong computer security capabilities. US is better at making bombs then chips, so Israel gets that in return, which when they get US aid is spent into US companies, helping America. They trade a lot of intelligence and is a safe place for the American military to operate from when needed. Israel does not want anything to do with Palestine as much as Palestine launches rockets at them. Currently the status quo works better for them, which is unfortunate. Israel is not perfect, but is a relatively stable country in a hostile area.

The fact that this “uniquely American problem” of maternal mortality not dropping with time seems to be spreading since 2016 is ominous. Continual progress isn’t automatic.
The point is that some doctors suck. Tell them everything, but if they don’t listen, get a new doctor. Some doctors would rather watch you die than lift a figure to help.

Our findings indicate that prepregnancy obesity, a modifiable factor, is a limited driver of racial–ethnic disparities in overall severe maternal morbidity.".

Doesn't completely explain the racial disparity, but maternal obesity (and associated increased risk of gestational diabetes, eclampsia) and teen pregnancy are both monster risk factors for maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality.

This supports exactly what I've been saying. I never said that obesity couldn't account for some cases. My point is that there are many factors (which I listed above) that contribute to higher maternal mortality rates among black women and those other factors are being glossed over in this comment thread.

The person I originally replied to said that higher maternal mortality rates among black women is "largely related to the sky high obesity rates". "Largely" implies that obesity is the predominant driver of maternal mortality rates among black women, which your first source indicates is a "limited driver" in that racial disparity. That means that there are many other factors contributing to the racial disparity in maternal mortality rates for black women that are being ignored for obvious reasons.

We're talking specifically about maternal mortality rates among black women, not women in general. The person I replied to farther up in the thread is suggesting (sans evidence) that obesity is the predominant factor for maternal mortality rates among black women, when we know that there are many other factors involved, all while ignoring those other factors. Do you have a statistic that shows that obesity and teen pregnancy among black women is "largely" the leading cause of maternal mortality rates?

Yeah it's pretty clear what some in this comment thread are trying to do; scapegoat higher maternal mortality rates among black women on obesity while ignoring all other factors. The narrative they're trying to weave is transparent.

The legislation doesn’t include funding to expand the Capitol Police, which is controlled by the state, and leaves the locally-controlled Jackson Police Department, which has lost hundreds of officers in recent years, to continue policing the rest of the city, including neighborhoods with the highest violent crime rates.

The legislation under consideration in Mississippi would expand the Capitol Complex Improvement District, which includes downtown Jackson and nearby areas, to include neighborhoods in northeast Jackson. The jurisdiction of the Capitol Police, which has about 120 officers and protects the district, would expand to reflect the new boundaries.

"It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor......Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration -Abe Lincoln , First Annual Message to the Senate and House of Representatives.
Can we not? Social security and Medicare are going to run out money soon and we have a deficit that has massively ballooned so I honestly am not sure how this budget hole can be patched short of printing our way out of it until we see double digit inflation as the norm (without the wage increases since this inflation is essentially a hidden tax).

No. Pensions in Spain are separate from regular taxes. The money that you contribute when you work is put in a common fund like a "piggy bank" where pensioners get their pensions when they get old.

Evidently people either disagree with reality. Or believe that your contribution of extremely relevant and pertinent information doesn’t add to the discussion. Somehow. People prefer to be outraged in the now, than even entertain the thought of hard truths that absolutely will affect them in the future.
The last year also put lye a pretty massive misconception that pretty much everyone had: that people like Putin, Xi, Erdogan, Trump etc. will seek consensus or evena pragmatic, mutually beneficial outcomes when treated like rational actors. France and Germany got burned by Russia because they assumed that an engaged Russia-that is, Putin, will give some degree of a fuck about bigger issues like mutually beneficial security and economic concerns. It is unfortunately not true. Whether China can be engaged with is a conversation worth having. Unfortunately thats not the conversation at hand, its whether Xi is worth engaging.
America enjoys it's military hegemony. They don't want too much competition from the European military industry because this reduces it's influence from it's weapons sales. At the same time however, the United States and Europe are peas of the same pod. They both enjoy the notions of binding trade agreements (especially when it comes to developing countries) and this is secured by military power.
Honestly, it's probably a little from column A, a little from column B. Most diplomacy is, doubly so when there's a war involved. That's the nature of understanding time, and the fact that you not only want to stop this current threat, but do your best to minimize all future threats. The jury is out on what will bring Russia into normalized relations with the West, if anything, and how long it'll take, but that's the ultimate goal.
Obviously. Anyone who has even the slightest idea of how the polish government operates knows this. The only people who are ignorant are either Americans or Russian shills.

Really. There were some voices that NATO has to do such things unanimously, apparently it wasn't US opinion. Also US is a natural leader of NATO and country geographically far from this conflict. For US to do something like that would be a much easier thing than for Poland, considering both NATO (for example countries like Germany or France would have harder time to protest against that. Remember it was weeks after start of war, some coutries were only sending protective equipment or defensive weapons) and Russia.
This reminds me of when the Taliban pick and choose things from Islam as well. Like forcing women to cover up but then not letting them run businesses/work, going to school, stoning people for adultery (except the burden of proof in Islam for such a crime is having 4 men seeing the act occur which is virtually impossible), and so on.
Why do I bring it up? As a reminder that this stuff gets the public to justify a war, which almost always ends up much worse for the people. Iran has to handle this themselves.

I mean thinking about it, there hasn’t been a single country that hasn’t gone medieval on some mfs, china still has concentration camps to this day that everyone just, stopped talking about for some reason, the US is shipping their bloodlust to other countries to fuel the warmachine and russia is being russia, not to mention slavs warcriming eachother on the regular and it wasn’t too long ago that all of europe was on fucking fire.

This is what my Muslim coworker would do. He slept in and fasted a couple of hours and then ate an enormous amount of food in the evening. I’m like isn’t that missing the whole point?

And from experience, there’s a good chance that if you’re that powerful you’ve done something terrible and benefitted from it, like african warlords drugging up children and giving them AKs to kill eachother, their short stint on this godforsaken earth tainted by substance abuse and constant death, those warlods live comfy fuckin lives, own a lot of shit, and disaster followed their every fucking move.
And boebert is a horrible person who I despise, doesn't change the fact that several times tlaib has been antisemitic. Just because Republicans are awful doesn't mean I'll support antisemitism. That's the point of my comment, she's a hypocrite. She claims this language is bad then she uses it herself disguised as "I'm only against Israel" while calling Jews sneaky and greedy and at one time literally retweeting a poster about ethnic cleansing all Jews from Israel.
Now one time her "accidentally" using a antisemitic trope I'd forgive and be understanding, but she's done this a lot. Every time she either hides behind saying she's not antisemitic just anti-israel but the language she uses is always antisemitic tropes. That or she'll either give a half hearted apology or do nothing and hope it goes away.

Ehhhhhhh. Kinda. I’ve had two mental health doctors suggest it tell me it can be scheduled, then it’s not scheduled. I’ve tried to deal with it myself and did manage to get an antidepressant for my body dysmorphia a few years ago which has helped. But with the shit I went through it’s hard to admit that I’m vulnerable and need help as I’d asked my chain of command for help and they told me that they believed my ex over me, then they’d have me go to the hospital when I showed up bruised, as tho they didn’t know what had caused that. They’d also told me that I had to go to counseling with him so yeah, I’m not really mentally in a place where I feel like anyone will believe me or give a shit that I need help.

No. They are second, third, fourth hand trades. Starting out legally then enter an illegal, unregulated, barely traceable market. Why? Because there is almost no useful regulation to prevent this from happening while there is simultaneously a ridiculous level of incentives for dealers and hoarders to take the risk, which they perceive as low since they don’t often get caught, and make a profit from doing it.

It is considered a point of diplomatic etiquette to wear your host nation's national order when you come for a state visit as a sign of goodwill if you are from a friendly country in good diplomatic standing, so you are usually gifted one on arrival so you can do so if you don't already have one. And also, the pomp and pageantry of the whole thing is considered good for greasing the wheels of international relations.
Long generations? I'm in my mid thirties but my youngest cousin isn't even 18 and our shared grandmother was born in 1928, our grandfather a few years before that. My grandmother had her first child (my mother) at age 31, and my mother had me at 29.

I'm only 28. My grandfather was born in 1918 and my mom is his youngest child. IIRC he fought in Italy near 1944, maybe for operation dragoon, I know he brought back a luger he took from an officer.
You still believe that? A simple Google search would take you out of your illussion! I Guess some people are just happier with their hate.
He wanted to gut INE, the independent body that organizes elections and functions as the electoral tribunal and give those powers to his minister of the interior, basically making all elections government elections, not be carried out by an independent entity the majority of Mexicans trust. He lost this battle in Congress, but it was also his first major reversal in public as it united a huge segment of society and for the first time one of his big projects received almost universal rejection, that one really pissed him off. He just passed a bunch of secondary laws to try to limit the funding of INE that are basically going to be annulled, which is why he wanted Yasmín Esquivel as president of the Supreme Court as she’s his only real ally there, the other justices he’s appointed have all proven to be level headed and even handed. He hoped Esquivel would delay and influence others as president of the court, but that crapped out for him.

...No? There's not a single country in the world where the nation has a single heartbeat, where even a censorious government lets things pass because they'd rather trick some (local) people into thinking they were doing something so they could say it was just some random idiots saying it. Because it's just some randos saying something the government knows isn't true without the need for guidance from above.

"208 Human Sexuality: We affirm God’s biblical design for marriage and sexual behavior between one biological man and one biological woman, which has proven to be the foundation for all great nations in Western civilization. We oppose homosexual marriage, regardless of state of origin. We urge the Texas Legislature to pass religious liberty protections for individuals, businesses, and government officials who believe marriage is between one man and one woman. We oppose the granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for sexual behavior or identity, regardless of state of origin. We oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose nontraditional sexual behavior out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values.".
Who will cave in first to demands, who will completely cripple and paralyze the government to do so. I don't see the far right wing giving a shit if they grind everything to halt. In fact, I think they'd see that as a victory in itself. With that in mind, I wonder if there would be a bipartisan member elected by bringing Democrats over. It's possible they've went so far right of right, that the only way to get anything done is for the rest of the Republicans to go left. I doubt it but...who knows. It's only been one day.
They are voting for Hakeem Jeffries, they aren't going to vote for a Republican just like the Republicans won't vote for a Democrat, this is the dysfunction in the Republican party on display for everyone, he needs 218 Republicans to vote for him, he only has 222, 19 have now defected after the last vote I saw. The Democrats are just laughing.

I’m simultaneously relieved, and also morbidly curious. I know there’s zero probability of it happening, but I would love to see how this plays out over the next days, weeks, months?
>Russia said on Monday it was downgrading diplomatic relations with NATO member Estonia, accusing it of "total Russophobia," and Tallinn responded by telling Moscow's envoy to the Baltic nation to leave.
Oh boy. I'd like to say my country not forget the past and support Ukraine too. However I'm from Hungary and our bastard, liar and corrupt government help to the Russians and licks Putin's \ss and veto everything that aims to help Ukraine. The Russians killed thousands of Hungarian people and terrorized the country through the history and our officials seems to forgot that... I'm ashamed for this.. But you guys are awesome!

"Russophobia". Russia is an insane country. They lie, cheat, kill, steal, spy, manipulate and sow discord - yet others are just supposed to accept it and go on with their lives? Fuck that mafia state.

Large Russian speaking population yes, however most consider themselves Estonian with Russian cultural heritage, which is vastly different than considering themselves ex-patriated Russians.

It is also worth considering that a sizeable chunk of Russian speakers did not voluntarily immigrate during soviet occupation, but were voluntold or shipped here in an effort by the regime to saturate and phase out local culture and language.

Un-fucking-believable. Biden just slapped the workers that helped elect him in the face. Really hoping he doesn't run in '24 now. This won't bode well for Democrats.

wait a minute, I had many many more millions of votes than that ok, many more, but it's much much easier, just so you understand, it's a lot easier to count to 11 thousand than it is to count to 3 million ok, a lot easier, and I'm doing you all a favor, they say that I'm too nice sometimes, that's probably true, I gave you all Massive Tax Cuts because we pay too much in Taxes but then the viciously horrible Democrats, who have hurt us a lot, don't forget the Radical Left has turned us into a Third World Country, we're losing majorly under Sleepy Joe. you have, we're talking, 121,000 Soldiers, basically all of them for Trump, I won the Military by a lot, close to 100%. I did Veterans, I did Space Force, I did way more things than Obama ever could, I was even nice enough to give you Judges, and there have been a few who haven't treated me fairly, and that's a real shame, a real shame. it's very disrespectful to the 45th President of the United States. ok, you can thank me now, thank me tomorrow, it's not a problem, enjoy yourselves.

Basically Kremlin is made of 70 year old fossils that don't understand tech at all. They would probably have banned or taken CCP-style total control Telegram if they had a clue, but they were just too illiterate to prevent sabotage and easily persuaded by the tech industry leaders; now it's too late, Telegram's current form is as irreplaceable as the Bolshoi ballet. Then the younger generation of elites that is trying to compete for the power that frees up whenever Putin's circle dies out (Medvedev, Prigozhin, etc) has figured out how to use Telegram for its own purposes. Unllike China, they are missing the middle ground of technically proficient pro-censorship officials that could actually take full control the platform.
They spooked him. Probably received veiled threats of a polonium milkshake from his poutine one on one phone call. Or they'll target his starlink satellites.
They spooked him. Probably received veiled threats of a polonium milkshake from his poutine one on one phone call. Or they'll target his starlink satellites.
And even in Russia Telegram actually somehow manages to exist as a reasonably secure app because 1) it's so big that it's culturally irreplaceable by now, 2) because of this even some government officials use this to communicate with their fans, and 3) the government actually tried to ban it, but they fucked up the technical implementation which made the ban impossible to implement, it was really unpopular, and then during the time when the regulators were trying to unfuck this all, some tech oligarchs managed to lobby the regulators to drop the issue.
This has been said a thousand times and it'll be said a thousand times more but it's crazy that the cartels can be this brazen and have little to no consequences. The worst part of it all is that civilians just trying to live their lives get caught in the middle and used as pawns.

5. United States makes the list. I was outside of Detroit in a little suburb walking down the street when a car pulls up near the bar I was going toward. I recognize the guy as a guy from the plant that I had talked to earlier in the day. He and I had a pretty good rapport (so I thought) and we had discussed what the company wanted me to do and what I was auditing, etc. I don't recall why, but for some reason he thought I was investigating him specifically. He had followed me from the factory to my hotel then where I had parked. He and three of his friends get out of this car and start talking to me, then reveal that they all have guns and that if his name is mentioned in a report, etc., he's going to kill me. I tried explaining that I'm not a police officer and this isn't that kind of investigation. We're just looking for how we can be more efficient, but all he hears is that he's getting laid off. Try as I might, the guy would not believe that I wasn't there to fire him. Had he not done that, he'd probably still be working there now. The scary part was that he was so crazy like to follow me, to pretend to be friendly, etc. I honestly thought he might kill me from sheer stupidity.

No President or advisor in their right mind would sign off on a high-level, high-stakes, once-in-a-century geopolitical crisis on terms they didn't set themselves when the alternative is a European dictator who can best be described as a giant man baby caricature cartoonishly sucking at the teat of a topless totalitarian on a horse DOWN BY THE RIVER!

This is all smoke and mirrors. They want to prove that NATO is the one they're fighting, not the "Czech, Polish, and Lithuanian mercenaries" or whatever they're claiming they're fighting this hour. They hope Biden ends the war with them so they can claim they lost to NATO, not Ukraine.

A much, much better use of her would be as the new Chair of the DCCC. She’s the most successful fundraiser in the Dem caucus outside of Pelosi, she knows how to run a successful campaign without the benefit of a big war chest, she’s arguably the best the Dems have at using social media to communicate messaging nationally and engage with constituents, and there’s a still simmering split within the party over centrists fighting the left harder than they fight the right that can her appointment could be an excellent olive branch to smooth things over. Plus you want Leadership to be in safe districts whenever possible. Also there’s some serious discontent about how the previous DCCC Chair adopted a strategy of amplifying extremist Republicans in primaries because he thought they’d be easier to beat. It’s fucking reckless and a lot of them won the general. Expect some more noise to be made over that. With now 3 (possibly 4 of Clyburn follows Pelosi and Hoyer) leadership positions open I expect the Congressional Progressive Caucus to bargain for a few of their own to take up one or two spots down the line in order to not fuck too much with Jeffries running. Then again, they might have the votes to stop him all together, but I doubt it.

Grab and go airport food is the worst. Not only does it cost twice as much as it should, it's terrible quality. $15 for a "salad" with processed chicken and bagged lettuce. Bleh.
Absolutely the fastest way to fix this appalling situation would be to require that ALL people who receive a paycheck from a government entity, whether federal, state, or local, receive a national minimum wage and no more: no expense funds, no housing allowance, no travel allowance, no funds for running an office, no franking privileges, no entertainment budget, and most especially no funds from PACs, friends, relatives, campaign donors, or any other outside source. Absolutely no income from investments of any sort. No outside income—NONE. They get the minimum wage for 40 hours per week, PERIOD. All of their tax records become public. This would apply to the military, as well as to. e.g. state university athletic coaches and personnel. All government pensions would be set at the minimum wage. I wonder how quickly things would change.
More two income households so it's not viable for one of both parents to be chained to their office desk all day and night. If you work for an old school domestic company that doesn't given two shits about government regulations ("black companies") then unfortunately your working life is not dissimilar to the stereotypes about life as an employee in Japan.
Aside from the unfortunate souls with an abusive employer/boss, which is absolutely not limited to Japan/Asia, most people that work crazy hours are going to be small business owners or people in professions that would have crazy working hours in almost any country (medical, etc.).

Don't know, dude. That's a cultural thing I'd be interested in finding out: do the regular run of the mill Japanese want 8 hour work days. I honestly don't know. It's obvious to me as a westerner, but I'm obviously not Japanese. I'm curious to see how this plays out. Hope for the best for the workers. Japan is hardcore with employment.

Oh… I just got it.. I have been racking my brain trying to figure out why anyone would give a shit about stuff from almost 200 years ago… their identification is with those people. It was the last “heroes” their area produced that they could claim relation to _because they themselves haven’t done anything_. You can’t proudly lay claim to being the grandson of notable South Carolinian Andy McDowell… best you could do is maybe being distantly related to Chadwick Bosema… oh I see their problem….

Oh, neat. It's time for the "Republican leaders won't support Trump," stories before he wins the nomination bc the Republican base still likes him and the "leaders" all fall in line and suck his dick. Feels like 2015 all over again.

IMO if this is what his campaign will look like, he will likely: (1) fail to bring in or sway enough new voters to his ticket, (2) lose a not-insignificant portion of his prior voters, (3) remind everybody who’s already voted against him why they must reject him again, and (4) all-but-guarantee yet another devastating loss in the popular vote. Any GOP mega donor seeking to abandon Trump likely felt vindicated in watching Trump’s announcement, because it was just so tired and stale.

Persian is an ethnicity, Iranian is a nationality. A lot of people in the western diaspora identify as Persian over Iranian because they have a national identity like American or Canadian as well as wanting to avoid being associated with the Islamic Republic government after the revolution.

you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims. the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa. the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%). it IS mostly anti semitism. to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above. furthermore. it is an offensive. stupid. strawman. trope. that i cant tell the difference. as a jew. when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.

Two. Your supposed understanding of environmental sciences shows that when it comes to radiation exposure and toxicity levels for tritium, you don't know shit.
For any marine organism to ingest enough tritium from the waste water, that they then contain harmful levels of radiation, would require ingesting more tritium than what they'll be exposed to from the waste water. And it does not matter if the waste water isn't evenly distributed. Due to the size of the Pacific, in particular the area where the waste water will be distributed by ocean currents once released, the tritium will be diluted enough that no marine organism will ever ingest or be exposed to enough of the isotope in order to contain harmful levels of radiation.

Some pledged to “decertify” the 2020 results, although election law experts said that is not possible. Others promised to decommission electronic voting machines, require hand-counting of ballots or block all mail voting. Their platforms were rooted in Trump’s disproven claims that the 2020 race was rigged, and their bids for public office raised grave concerns about whether the popular will could be subverted, and free and fair elections undermined, in 2024 and beyond.
Voters in the six major battlegrounds where Donald Trump tried to reverse his defeat in 2020 rejected election-denying candidates seeking to control their states’ election systems this year, a resounding signal that Americans have grown weary of the former president’s unfounded claims of widespread fraud.

Chavez’s management of the Venezuelan economy led to an over dependence on oil exports, which was fine while the value of oil remained high; but in the 2008 recession, demand for Venezuelan oil from China fell by a lot, meaning the value fell too, sending the economy into a slowdown. The long term impact of this was that the Venezuelan economy was already slowing down before the US embargo even happened.

For me I think the cause of the economic crisis is a mix between the long term effects of Chavez’s economic policies, but also because of the short term effects of the US embargo.

One could say that Chavez’s policies had already weakened the Venezuelan economy a lot, but the US embargo was the event that was the trigger for the current catastrophe. After the embargo the Venezuelan economy nearly tanked, and its GDP fell by around a third in only a year. Lifting the US embargo would lead to the best outcome for not only Venezuela, as it would allow oil exports to resume and drive economic growth, but also it would be preferable to the US, since the US needs to replace their Russian oil and gas with something else.
there were a million fucking priorities on day one. you seem to be jumping on this as a way to low key shit on Biden for not doing the thing 2 years ago you just became aware of. you might have noticed the previous administration did A LOT of damage. plus there are a few things going on right now. people have to make calls on what's the most important thing right now, and even if the rules had been changed it would not have changed this at all. i'm really fucking tired of people nitpicking Biden over not being able to see the future and do the one thing out of the billions that require his attention because it's on your radar right now. the notion that this president has the time to go over ever thing trump changed and address them is pretty silly.

Possibly. With hundreds of regulations to address, it is possible this one hadn't gotten to the top of the list yet.
That's because he doesn't want people to associate his failure to address those crises with him; he'd rather they remember him for fighting against "enemies" that don't exist. For one thing, much of his base isn't going to think too hard about it, and will accept that he's trying to maintain their values, albeit in an extreme way. Most people aren't going to see the forest instead of the trees, because that requires critical thought, and if there's one party that actively fights against critical thinking, it's the republicans. They don't want us intelligent. They want us stupid and easy to lead. It's why they keep attacking education time after time. It's a tried and true method used by all despots and tyrants, and what are republicans? They are the conservative party - the party in all governments that wants to maintain power among the elites and deny it to the common people. Democracy is literally anathema to a conservative ideology.
There’s always Show Pro. It’s 1099 work but if you’re around hotels/convention centers you should be fairly busy. Covid destroyed the state but there’s still work. Yeah being 27 in the middle of a housing rental crisis smacked with insurance companies pulling out of the state. Hard times right now.
Maybe if we can't bring a good administration to Haiti, then we should lead Haitians towards good administration. 11 MM inhabitants are nothing when compared to the total population of Western countries, it would only be necessary to distribute them in proportional amounts in different countries of the west and disband that country, I believe that this would be the most pragmatic and beneficial solution for the Haitian people.
You hit the nail right on the head. Once a country reaches a tipping point of perpetual corruption and lawlessness it's almost impossible to recover from it. You see this in Haiti, Somalia and Mexico.

Only historically. From around 1825-1950, Haiti was forced to make substantial debt repayments to France. Since then, most of Haiti's debt has been cancelled, and the rest refinanced, so that their total annual debt service payments are actually under $10m per year, while France alone sends Haiti $25m a year in aid, on top of exceptional aid for events like the earthquake.

Trump never had the authority to declassify documents related to nuclear secrets, definitely doesn't have any authority to declassify anything since Biden was sworn in, and it is beyond question that the documents are classified, because neither Trump nor anyone else declassified them. Whether any document is classified is cut and dry, and only idiots and liars believe Trump could have secretly "declassified them by thinking about it". Trump also doesn't have to share the documents with anyone for it to be a crime, as multiple experts have attested.
Exactly. It's the easiest way to be a popular president. There's a ton going on and you can let the experts make the difficult decisions. FDR gets a ton of credit for just saying yes or no.
He told the following in one of the interviews 3 and a half years ago: “If I decide to run… if I run… well actually if I am elected, at first people will badmouth me, it’s already happening and I already feel that, then they will learn to respect me and then, because I personally believe that a person can be a president for only 5 years, I can explain my position (interviewer says: “no need, I agree”), when I go, people will cry”.

The US has been increasing munitions production again and again and trying to exhort western allies to increase production as well. The past year has definitely caused the DOD to reassess munitions stockpile levels. The fact of the matter is, Ukraine is in a fight where they are greatly outnumbered and there isn't a realistic amount that will be enough, nevertheless, collectively, we need to give Ukraine what they need to win.
I agree with your sentiments and knowing (and following) everything (public) the West has provided, I still have a sense more can and should be done to make Ukraine's fight quite a bit less unfair.

Not really applicable. Artillery shells would be relatively useless in a war with China. That would be fought with long range missiles and air superiority. NATO has plenty of that as we aren't supplying much of it to Ukraine and the planes and tanks we are supplying are older tech and will just be replaced with the latest and greatest. If anything, this will strenhen the Western Militaries for a modern war against China. Ukraine and Russia are using metaphorical sticks and stones compared to the stuff NATO is prepared to fight with.
There are still a lot of units training in the EU, UK and US on equipment more recently signed off for donation, once those systems and people start getting offloaded into Ukrainian territory we'll see even further escalations of relative combat performance.
But they didn't do this. Giving Russia some hope by reduced support to Ukraine and watching Russians bleed dry, while Putin gets painted more and more into corner is surely a fine strategy. And you can't really judge this - it's a pretty good approach for the West and in the best interest of EU and US citizens. Maybe even for Ukrainians (in the long run), although they definitely wouldn't agree right now. If Ukraine wins tomorrow, Russia might be back in a year or two. If Ukraine wins by the summer, Russia might need two decades to rebuild their shit. So forth.

If you have an entire structure based on everyone being in position due to loyalty to the people above them, rather than merit… And if you have crap equipment poorly maintained because of a poor population and rampant corruption at all levels (meaning they want to steal and sell stuff, or just get away with not maintaining it)… And people conscripted out of desperation or force, rather than decent careers and a belief in what they are fighting for… It doesn’t lend itself to having a highly motivated and well equipped military who can be trusted to use their initiative.

Much agreed! It’s definitely worth watching (even it’s very disturbing at some parts). But the point is definitely that people (doesn’t really matter are they Russians or any other) are just numbers for them. Some semi-high officials of regions openly call them “trash” or “meat”. FSB director Patrushev (basically putin’s right hand) literally stated that FSB are “new nobles” in Russia, and no laws and rules common people have to follow aren’t applied to them.

I agree. Also it’s very hard to update that strategy much when you have so much corruption and authoritarianism.

mexico is absolutely a racist and discriminatory place for central americans. if you actually knew people that have made the journey, you would hear stories of cutting hair, changing appearances and vocabulary as they pass through mexico in an attempt not to be singled out for being a migrant. anywhere you have to change yourself so much to be safe in, is not a safe place. another thing you would know would be that small mexican gangs and bandits often rob and beat, sometimes rape or kill, migrants traveling north, using the paths migrants take to their advantage. you would also know that the fastest way north is on , and when it passes through towns, sometimes people throw rocks at migrants riding it on an attempt to knock them off, which would result in severe trauma, and death if youre lucky. what about that is safe?

The Trump administration actively created artificial bottlenecks in the legal immigration / asylum systems. The cruelty must have been a nice bonus for those pushing the policies.

The strenh of the Supreme Court is a controversial issue in Israel because it’s seen as unelected elite. However, this isn’t the issue. In the Israeli system of checks and balances the court is the only body that can limit the government power and stop tyranny of the majority .We have no written constitution and only one Parliament House that is controlled by the government . The current government feels like they will be the majority forever. Unfortunately, because of the demographic trends in Israel they are right. Netanyahu is usually pragmatic and he hate reforms but he sees this reform as a “get out of jail” card. Unfortunately he is also right.
So the consequences of this reform could be someone expands settlements illegally in the west bank the Palestinians would fight it in court and court would rule in their favor but the parliament overturns the decision with it’s majority allowing the orthodox right-wing parties to expand settlements and gain more popularity with the haredi and settlers maintaining their power over the government for decades not to mention that this will guarantee another intifada.

Yes. Netanyahu himself is secular and pro LGBT and until his charges also very pro judicial system. Despite that, he understands that the only way for him not to finish in jail is to turn himself into a mix of Viktor Orban and a genie that will make all the fasicsts and ultra religious dreams come true.
They are an American company and allowing threats on your platform (corporate company-owned social media is NOT protected by Free Speech laws) to share threats against the president of the USA opens up legal problems. I have been on a forum that had such rules even though the the owner was not at all US-friendly.
Really? Do you really feel I should be allowed to doxx you and call a Reddit mob to arms to harass and attack you and your loved ones? Or should my messages be censored if I did something like that?

Exactly. Your principles shouldn't change depending on who you are speaking about. I can understand why people think the way they do though. Khomeini is a pos and his own people should remove him from power.

Sigh. Costs didn't go up by 10%. Supply went down. Prices go up by however big the demand for eggs vs the new supply is.

Interesting. I know Avian Flu can be devastating for supply as you basically have to kill all birds on the property if the virus is found, but according to this article no virus was found at producers in the US. There is no law against lying to the public to justify higher prices, but if you have multiple suppliers using the same lie then it seems like price fixing. Definitely, deserves investigation, and a severe crackdown.

So dumb. It's embarrassing really. This won't go anywhere. The price of eggs is up because of a flu, and if the price was artificially low (which is what these dolts want) you would not be able to find any eggs anywhere.

Eggs are expensive because of a flu, which reduced supply and because the price goes up as supply goes down so as to keep demand at a point where you can still buy any fucking eggs.

If you're in line by 7pm, you get to vote. The US also allows early voting and in many cases that happens for multiple days to weeks beforehand. There is plenty of opportunity to vote in the US, people are just lazy, when it comes down to it. I never understood the argument of "poor" people not being able to vote because when I held hourly jobs within the last 10 years, I worked EVERY weekend. That's when I made the most money. I always ended up with one or two days off during the week...and it wouldn't be difficult to make that day Tuesday and if I happened to wait until voting Tuesday to vote (again, why would I since I had 2 weeks before with early voting), it wouldn't matter because I'd have the day off to begin with.
Exactly. He saw that the way things were, Babiš could have a shot (billionaire, straight up mafia - already was at multiple courts, currently investigated in France for money laundering, populist, and an idiot, who can't even properly speak without pre written text from his PR team) and there was also a bit of pressure from people around him (that he should run).

No. Babiš has framed Pavel as a warmonger (going so far as to send out fake texts from Pavel telling the recipient that they have been mobilized), but it’s all bluster.
"Stop saying we sent the drones to Russia that we sent to Russia, otherwise we'll be forced to send drones to Russia." Not much of a threat when put in context.
Unfounded accusations? Zelensky has incontrovertible evidence, namely, Iranian drones shot down on a daily basis including fragments as well as completely intact drones.

Wow. Appreciate the source. I knew about executing drug smugglers and users but this is the first on deliberately injecting them with narcotics to get them addicted. I need to read more and about Iran HRM.

For this reason and based on other shenanigans, such as falsifying causes of death on official documents, dumping the beaten bodies of people who poofed out of existence for a few weeks out unmarked government vans, shooting protestors (both lethal and non), raiding school dorms and abducting student dissidents, forced confessions under torture and blackmail, and a multitude of other tinpot-mullah bullshit, NO, I'm wouldn't be fucking surprised if they were injecting people with stuff after they got rounded up to default court cases more firmly in the prosecutors favor.

> The highlight reel: 76 veterans dead of COVID-19 in Holyoke at the Soldiers Home, run by a political hack appointed by Baker despite a lack of any credentials in health care. Tens of thousands of out-of-state violations unprocessed by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles that kept lethal drivers on the roadways, including a West Springfield man who killed seven motorcyclists in New Hampshire. Commuters on MBTA trains left stranded during winter snowstorms or injured in derailments; pedestrians hospitalized after a malfunctioning escalator in one T station sent them plummeting to the ground or dead, in one case, at another station after a fall through a corroded staircase. An inept COVID-19 vaccine rollout led by a man who was once the CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. State police officers collecting pay for overtime shifts they did not work and destroying documents to hide the scheme.

No. We need to refer to them as "entitlements", because that's what they are. I pay into the system, I am entitled to reap the benefits. Republicans keep trying to make "entitlements" a dirty word, and we shouldn't let them.

It’s terrifying. I mean, there are republicans officials actively trying to start a civil war, and yet what’s on the news is what Zelensky was wearing and how this means Biden hates Russia and us starting a war with China. Maybe I’m old but I remember that Russia (not it’s people but it’s government) has not been a friend to the US since WWII and that was only by proxy because Hitler was stupid enough to invade in the middle if fucking winter. Where all this love comes for Russia is fucking flabbergasting to me, and they just want to focus on outfits and getting rid of drag shows. I mean what the ever loving fuck.

There are clearly better choices, there are 334 million Americans who are eligible for two terms as President, there are two Americans who are eligible for one term as President, if Republicans want Republican policies to be enacted they should want a President who is eligible for re-election because most Presidents get re-elected.
Stroll over to the conservative subreddit. It's a nonstop parade of shit fits they're all done with him. A surprising amount of them seem to be starting to see the obvious which is there is no way Trump ever wins a national election again. He's beyond toxic to every single thing he comes in contact with and the midterms proved he's a stone cold loser. He's scared off every segment of voter now except the die hard delusional conspiracy theory freaks. Republican voters are starting to realize that the guy they worshipped doesn't give a flying fuck about them or the Republican party after all.
Kennedy was supposedly worried about bureaucracy undermining Presidential ambitions. Qsers see that as "deep state" even though that term refers to a Turkish agency tasked with ensuring Turkey remained a democratic nation. Really, Kennedy was just full of drugs most of the time as far as I can tell. Nothing like a little speed to fuel paranoia.

Nobody wants to make sacrifices injurious to their own lifestyle, it's true. Solutions have to take that into account. Saying things like "consumers need to give up consuming", "we need to stop all this capitalism", "that stuff you like is opulent and unnecessary and you should feel bad", and "bring on the revolution" is a load of crap because wishing achieves nothing, what you wish for won't happen, and if it ever did happen it would probably end badly. We have these conversations about climate change and it turns into a bunch of anti-capitalists talking about their own thing instead. Even supposedly communist China is massively industrial now and emitting lots of CO2, so this proposed political change where we all renounce consumerism is a big useless wobbly blancmange of fantasy. We're going to stay comfortable or die in extreme weather events (or be eaten by hordes of starving migrants or whatever the latest doomsday scenario looks like), and we're going to have to find solutions that include comfort, if any.
Really? What about the millions of animals being cut up and eaten? A very common example of trying to blame other things when people don't want to change themselves.
They basically built a city from the ground up to be able to host the championship, which is unprecedented. Normally, FIFA expects you to already have all the infrastructure required to host a world cup, and countries "only" need to make some changes and build a few stadiums. I mean, it would be madness to grant the biggest sport event in the world to a desert just because they promise they'll build a city in 10 years, right? right?
even in my shithole country, 1 death would be enough to halt the construction and put someone into investigation, it is almost like they are saying that they died for thre greater good, this wc is going to be a shitshow, i dont like sport, but i would ocassionally watch it because of all the excitement it entails, i am not watching any single match of this crap.

Right!? Like Brazil was obviously a poor choice but at least Brazil has one of the best football cultures in the world and boy o boy does Brazil know how to party so it makes much more sense than Qatar.
No need to include "for money" - "People that do this should be considered as traitors" is fine by me. Not only do these pilots get money, but they are likely provided lots of other comforts in order to get more info out of them. Honey traps are common tools.
There are cases where Australian-born citizens joined paramilitary units and other groups (ISIS, etc) that were considered hostile/engaged in hostile actions with Australia or their allies who ended up being tried for treason and/or other crimes; so best for any Aussie to be very picky about who they join, unless they want to risk being flagged as a traitor or member of a terrorist organisation.

Thank you for actually searching it up for me. Was discussing it with a workmate. And we both agree it's disgusting that the CCP is doing this. Answered my question perfectly.

We're seeing a (very, veeeeeery slow) cooling change in stance to China recently, after the impact from the wine export fiasco, attitudes towards treatment of minorities and other items; so... dunno - I hope that's showing the shape of things to come, as I'm not liking the lease agreements - not to mention all the farms being sold directly to them and now considered territory of China, apparently.
This honestly makes the most sense if you think about everything going on. Bleed the Russians while they wait for Western tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, longer range rockets, and possibly jets so that they can steam roll them in a grand scale counter offensive like Kharkiv. Russia has gone through half of all of their working tanks according to U.S. intelligence and they've gone through at the very least 60k lives and more than double that in injuries. About a million of their best and brightest have fled the country and their economy is on the verge of collapsing. I can't see Ukraine messing this up with all they've accomplished and I can't see Russia winning anymore. The Russians are tossing away so much equipment and so many lives at taking a couple of kilometers that they could easily lose. A wise man once said, "We are very lucky that they are so fucking stupid.".
Putin humiliated. The president of the USA perfectly happy to rock up in Kiev while his country is at war with Ukraine.
And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.".

"Characters matter". And George is quite the character He's a headline-consuming distraction machine Unfortunately he's like a firework display that catches fire - all the bang-pop spectacle is happening all at once, instead of being dripped out every time they need us to Oooo and Awww away from whatever horrible shit they trying to get away with.

What standards? Everything the GOP tribe does is good and justified because they're of the GOP tribe. If others outside the GOP do the same thing, it's automatically bad because they're not part of the GOP tribe.
I'll never forget when Pompeo said "there will be a smooth transition....to the second Trump administration" long after the election had been decided. It showed how much of a pussy he is, completely unwilling to acknowledge obvious truths if he thinks it might hurt him politically. Luckily, Pompeo is never going to be president. He has the charisma of a wet mop, and, as far as I can tell, literally no one of any ideology actually likes him. I'm not sure if it's a humiliation fetish, or if he's just a moron who can't read the writing on the wall, but I really don't understand why he keeps putting himself out there.
Basically. A GOP state Rep in Iowa (Idaho?) is in prison now for raping an intern and another state rep was so mad at him being accused she revealed the name of the victim and made a "sorry not sorry" statement.

Exactly. He is one of the more terrifying Republican Presidential hopefuls. He is playing up the Christian Nationalism like Pence, the racism like Trump, but he seems much more belligerent and intentionally callous. Like, Trumps callousness is an outgrowth of his narcissism, but Pompeos is that AND borderline militant Christianity.
If maga politicians win the aftermath will be devastating to this country. It won’t be until open relations fleecing American interests to Russia, open handshakes and hugs with Russian leaders, Europe and Canada cutting ties with the US and the dissolution of NATO and 10s of thousands of supposedly Christian nationalists sisters and daughters dying from health risks associated from the abortion ban until the avg conservative voter will realize that they sold their country and democracy down the drain to “own the lives” at all costs because they were stupid enough to believe the psi ops being waged against the US. After true Americans take back their country these former maga supporters need to be treated they the same way woman in ww2 who whored themselves out to the nazis.. publicly shamed and sent out to live their lives in exile to live as second class citizens stripped of their right to vote because of their treason.

And there we have it. We cannot discuss this topic openly and honestly because that somehow feeds into right-wing misinformation.
“Without the sharp reduction in Russian gas deliveries, Europe would now likely be enjoying above-average growth rates due to the post-Covid-19 rebound, instead of suffering near stagnation,” Salomon Fiedler, an economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in a research note. “But at least Europeans have been able to avoid the worst outcome: outright gas shortages necessitating forced cutoffs, which would wreak havoc on the economy.”.
Europe may have avoided the worst-case economic scenario envisioned after the invasion of Ukraine, thanks to a sharp drop in energy prices.

Yes. Black people and Hispanics tend to be incredibly conservative in their views of LGBT, and Republicans definitely have been successful with their messaging that “the left” is trying to groom their children with sexually explicit and pro-LGBT propaganda. Black and Hispanic voters are also more likely to face substantial difficulties due to inflation wiping out their already low-on-average buying power while the Democrats keep telling everyone that things are going swell/okay (the economy is doing fine, for those of us who are upper middle class or higher).

I hate The NY Times. They had an oil shill “test” a Tesla and of course he completely lied about his drive. Then they bought 538 and scolded Nate Silver for daring to defend his modeling…which turned out to be dead on in 2012.

It's at least $30 in tolls both ways to get to Manhattan from AC. Also, you wouldn't be riding amtrack from AC to NYC. You'd be riding nj transit to outside of philly, to go out of your way to take Amtrack. Bus 319 from AC to the port authority would run like $5 or $10 and take about 30 min to an hour more than driving. Oh, and that isn't even including parking near Penn Station or elsewhere in NYC. Have you ever even done this drive?
Im not exactly familiar with the location but you gotta remember these areas have so much utilities and underground infrastructure that a large chunk of the cost is likely going to be in protecting/redesigning/moving them. I worked as a civil engineer on a hospital near me that was going through redesigns and most of my design time was reworking the utility networks and same with a large portion of the construction phase. NYC/NJ metro areas are like this except on Crack, steroids and then to the 10th power.

No, he didn’t. As a guy who despises Trump, I’ve been coming across articles for years about him “having a bad day” for various legal setbacks and none of it ever leads to prosecution. He’s been spamming the courts with noise for decades. He’s still the GOP’s front runner for 2024. He’s committed enough crimes out in the open for any other citizen to end up getting waterboarded in a CIA black site, including smuggling nuclear secrets and instigating an armed attempt to storm congress and overthrow the fucking government. He’s fairly obviously a Russian intelligence asset. His tax fraud is an open secret. Tons of his former associates have been convicted of crimes to which he was a party. And he hasn’t had a truly “bad day” yet through all of it, he’s holding rallies and playing golf.

Increased efficiency from less bloated bureaucracy (physicians make up a much smaller portion of healthcare costs than ever before despite Medicaid reimbursement being more generous than private insurance was just a couple decades ago), preferably mixed with an across the board increase in reimbursement for government healthcare (whether it's Medicaid for all or a completely new system of payment).

Is it a good thing though? We have some of the highest tax rates (even compared to NYC) and we have failing schools, severe homeless, substance abuse, and tents/trash everywhere. We pass these things and then have no competence to implement them while nonprofits reap millions. We are ranked 49 for mental health care services, coming in right above Alabama. The grift game is strong here, unfortunately.

I’m not following how this explanation coexists with the one you were agreeing to (“let’s be real…”). I can only see the statements coexisting when closeted gay Russian soldiers are sent to fight in Ukraine where they can finally be truer versions of themselves by raping men, I guess it’s possible but what a weird mindset. I’m not disagreeing or challenging you on it, I just don’t get it, it’s okay though. I agree with you 100% though on the rest. Vile humans. I made some comments a few days ago to people that were trying to excuse them with stuff like “I think they’re all just good people in bad situations.” Last year, a Russian gymnast competed in an international competition with a Z on the chest of his uniform, stood on the podium like that, and people still whine that they should be allowed to compete because sports shouldn’t be political. I can’t fathom how people are okay with all of it, it all just hurts.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk responded to the Russian government’s order, stating that Russian officials and occupation authorities may be planning to deport more than 100,000 residents from the Kherson region to Russia under fears that Moscow's forces may lose further territory in war-torn Ukraine.

Thank you. Super glad the first thing I saw in the comments was this, because it sure as fuck was the first thing I thought.
They're prolonging their capabilities by buying Iranian missiles and dialing back how many they use from their own stocks. Also, they are presumably able to restock at a greatly reduced rate from their factories.
Like it or not, Orthodoxy would not have become a mainstream Christian church without the Russian empire, and the use of the Julian calendar by the Orthodox church went hand in hand with the Russian empire using Julian calendar in secular context too until 1917 - you can argue what came first, of course, but the fact remains that celebrating Christmas on Jan 6th/7th in Ukraine is associated with Russian colonial rule and (strangely) not Ethiopian orthodoxy. And there's very little appetite for that at the moment.

Apparently it can track and engage multiple targets simultaneously with precision. It will also work in conjunction with other inexpensive SAM systems used in Ukraine and will likely focus on faster, more powerful projectiles like Kalibr cruise missiles and aircraft. As a result, it will free up other systems workload so that they can mainly focus on smaller targets like drones and such.

Really? That I didn’t know. Most of my friends here in Canada who are Ukrainian are January 7 folks. Validated it to with a Google search but I’ll take your word, makes sense.
In the live thread, ISW is saying that the Russian have begun their major offensive in Luhansk. Please, survive Ukrainian warriors Keep fighting smart.
Wagner is not terminating recruitment? From ISW last night, "The Wagner Group is reportedly resorting to more coercive tactics in its campaign to recruit prisoners, possibly in response to declining numbers of recruits since autumn 2022. Independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on February 8 that Russian lawyers and human rights activists stated that Wagner Group representatives and Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and Federal Security Service (FSB) officials are threatening prisoners in Samara and Rostov oblasts, Krasnodar Krai, and the North Caucasus with new criminal cases if they refuse to volunteer with the Wagner Group in Ukraine.".

This is what blows my mind. We are living in an advanced time with such easy access to information. It makes me realise that education is the root of everything.
I appreciate someone bringing some reality to the situation, but to add to that, the fine that they get has to be larger than the amount that they would pay to their workers in benefits or they will just sign the checks for the fine and write it off as "the cost of doing business.".
This is because we had the brilliant piece of shit stupid fucking idea to reward the handlers of critical infrastructure if things go wrong, mostly because of lobbying, propaganda, and a general culture of messiah-like worship around capitalists that own this kind of infrastructure. They should go down if their shit fails. That’s the core god damn tenet of capitalism. But it’s not how the real world works, and bad people manipulate a system because the system is predicated on a kill or be killed doctrine. So we fucking reward the rich when shit goes tits up. This means it is quite literally more fucking profitable for the owners of all this shit to light it all on fire than for them to meet their workers’ needs fully.
Propaganda, censorship of ideas and violent suppression of protests is not just a hallmark of authoritarianism, it's a requirement for them to stay in power. Violent cowards.
Conversely it's pretty easy to point to what the Russian interference in the 2016 election was. They set up spam internet camps in places like Belarus and Thailand, paying people to propagate fake news and misinformation. There have been massive FB pages with millions of followers that have been outed as set up to do this. Even if US intelligence is somehow amplifying the calls on Chinese social media, which is probably impossible given that they are a locked down system unlike Western platforms with harsh government control of moderation, that is completely different from the analogy you are trying to make.

You can only slaughter so many people. Eventually it will all rebound. Holding together so many people in a vice like grip can't happen in perpetuity. It will always eventually unravel.

Authoritarianism is violent cowardice. They are so afraid of ideas, of people expressing themselves, of being criticized, that they have to react with violent oppression and scapegoating. Sure, China, your CCP always knows best, is never corrupt (except when it is, must be foreigners), and always has the peoples' interests first and foremost and not retaining its own iron grip on power. 🙄.

Empirically, such regimes will always eventually crumble. That's not down to a few individuals falling through the cracks.
I'm not suggesting ideas, but how does the Russian military not have some nuclear engineers that could do this? I'm not saying they are huge supply in any military, but it seems like after a year there's bound to be some that could have been reassign. I understand not all tasks are the same but even so.
We weren't far from this incident growing to a scale when not 50000 people were evacuated but millions would be at risk of having to relocate (Chernobyl was worst case scenario for the reactor but the way it was handled was surprisingly competent for Russians, they accidentally sent one man who could actually see through bullshit and cared, I doubt they have many like that left by now).

Why? What’s the worst that can happen? A rogue engineer builds a structural design flaw into one of the plants, causing the entire thing to blow up if an enemy happens to shoot some torpedoes down the long ventilation shaft leading to the reactor core? Not likely as the target area would only be about two meters.
Don’t worry, corporations have no morals, they will still invest and buy from you as long as you can give them what they want at the lowest price.
But I suppose none of that matters as corporations will just buy from the cheapest country anyway. (Edit: Or maybe not, all eggs in one basket approach has shown itself to be problematic. Guess it will depend on how much risk vs low prices corporations will accept.).

Iraq was to remove a dictator and became a development project, Saudi Arabia's leader has been strongly criticized by the US regarding human rights, and Guantanamo Bay is being shut down, although it was too long a site in legal limbo. However, the targeted murder of civilians by Russia in Ukraine, a land grab not seen since Hitler and Stalin, and removal of 13,000 infants from their families go way beyond a ything the US has done. India should condemn Putin's invasion and not purchase blood oil. India's imports of Russian oil has increased 30 fold since Putin's mass murders began.
According to the latest market reports coatings make up 7.6% of the PFC market, of that 7.6% non-stick coatings (frying pans) represent 1.5% (source BCC Research). So by eliminating frying pans you have successfully reduced PFC usage by 0.11%. I would introduce you to the countless other applications of PFCs and why PFCs are so hard to replace in those applications, but I think that would just waste both of our time. Just rest assured that people smarter than you are working on it. ;-).
These regulatory processes often involve paperwork being submitted, rejected, resubmitted, processed, still being processed because the regulatory agency got its budget cut so they are short staffed, still being processed because they're european and all on holiday because it's now august. Got it back. Now on to stage two, oh shit US congress finally passed a bill now check and see if that changed anything oh good it didn't, wait someone in another department is on maternity leave, and oh bloody hell it's delayed because Christmas means all the government people are on holiday.
But through a combination of luck, Russian miscalculations, Russian corruption, the sheer force of will of the Ukrainian people, and the massive balls hanging between Zelensky's legs, they were thwarted in the first first few days and the West had time to organise and more importantly, Ukraine still had a functioning government to which we could send supplies.
That sounds low to me. Everything you hear from the ones who survived and got captured is like, "There were 10 of us and I was the only survivor," or "There were 10 of us and only 2 of us survived." (They send them out in groups of 10 to be gunned down so they can figure out where the Ukrainians are. Must be fun being a Russian convict in Wagner.).

Participants in a war have zero credibility for accurate reporting. It's like listening to sports players as to the outcome of a play. They're going to say they scored and the other team was only playing dirty.

I don’t know. Cawthorn lied about his education, his real estate career, his non existent Paralympic career, even the basic facts of his very accident. If you want to go down a rabbit hole, Google his name plus insider trading, sexual harassment, Jan. 6th, Hitler vacation, airport guns, etc. Joke was on the GOP who supported him though when he started lying about them having drug orgies. I’m curious to see how the Santos story ends and if he learns his lesson. Cawthorn didn’t change after getting caught in his lies. He only got worse, much like Trump.

These aren’t “embellishments”. And embellishment would be rounding up 6 months to a year. Not just making up years of experience from whole cloth.

Federal office holders cannot be recalled, unfortunately. But the Constitution does contain some language that may come into play, depending on how deep his lies go:
Obviously it really depends on your perspective, in terms of "better or worse" but I think getting Trump (and other extremists) away from mainstream politics is a net positive. Unfortunately DeSantis is only more center-right when comparing to Trump's extremism, but I think without the vitriol that trump brings and enables within his follower base it is much easier to foster actual discussions of policy and ideals across party lines.
A mimosa? I’ll be running to the abc store soon and I’ll pour myself a two shot screwdriver for the both of us. I’m damned glad that we’re still putting up a fight!

Combine that with a ton of Republican controlled state legislatures likely putting out even more draconian “election integrity” voter suppression laws (who will undoubtedly be emboldened by the upcoming Supreme Court case), and they’ll be putting all their efforts into putting up less outwardly idiotic candidates and disenfranchising likely dem voters every way possible.

But he doesn't need to take a lot. Every voter he takes is a GQP voter. The GQP has lost the last four presidential elections in a row. The only reason they have a chance at control of the House is through gerrymandering assisted by the SC. Now imagine they lose 5-10% to a third party. They lose every state wide race, even in red states.
Just recently the US had to greenlight Turkeys invasion of Kurdish Syria in 2019 knowing full well what that would mean for Syrian Kurds-- and this was only the eighth great betrayal of the Kurds by America in 100 years.
Before that in the 2000s the US used Kurdish freedom as a reason to invade Iraq, but then never mentioned independence again and then allowed Turkey to assist Iin the invasion by heavily bombing Kurdish Iraq.

And then before that, after WW2-- which was the second of three great opportunities to actually give the Kurds a state-- the US pretended to support Kurdish independence by arming them in Iraq against a ruler America didn't like. But then in 1963, we cut all aid to them to instead back a military coup that featured Saddam Hussein, and once they took power the US gave them napalm specifically to use on the Kurds.

And then before that in the conclusion of the Gulf War, the US stood down to allow the Iraqi military to massacre Kurds across Iraq because Bush Sr supported a strong military junta taking power to keep the nation under control (he just hoped it would be without Saddam).

Fucking deplorable. the other group is the ypg which many foreign fighters have aided over time. At one point they were a hot spot for foreign fighters.
about the first I dont see the government repress that, they dont agree but they dont repress that. Of course people can get mad about everything and is not the problem, but doing something just because you want to make someone mad is not the intention behind freedom of speech/expression.
yes, its a loophole because the intention of freedom of speech/expression is that the government cant repress different arguments, ideas and concepts.

just destroying something with the intention to provoke and this is his only intention according to interviews is not the idea of the freedom he enjoys.

doing something for the sole purpose of provoking others like the intentions here are, has nothing to do with the intentions of freedom of speech or freedom of religious choices. But its a loophole and an internal "problem"(the loophole) of Sweden, no other country has the right to interfere.

Completely different. Protesting the invasion itself from the US won’t do much. Protest for the government to take more action against Russia and aid Ukraine, and that’ll make a difference.
It might just be his undoing. Not popular means he is of no value to the Republicans and might even spur them to (privately) see indictment as a way to get rid of him. Not popular means he may not find running as an independent feasible (outside of his maga morons, who is going to fund his run? Put gas in his private jet?) eliminating the risk to the GOP. Not popular means the DOJ can take off the kid gloves w/o the fear of mass rioting and unrest. He’s one bread breaking moment with degenerates and Nazis away from being irrelevant. Please make it so 🙌.

Terrible headline. Of course the party is done with the useful idiot. They got their Supreme Court and totally unnecessary tax scam while he occupied the White House. He’s an inept politician. Everything he touches dies. His base will vote for him and anyone like him who isn’t as ignorant, like DeSantis, Cotton, Hawley, etc., they love the bigotry and intolerance he legitimized.
I think he is trying to acknowledge it and show to his people that he cares. Putin's image is carefully managed in Russia, he has to be associated with everything that's good and not associated with anything bad. He will often complain about bad stuff going on in Russia as though he isn't responsible for it. It's a very successful strategy, there's a common belief that Putin is the good tzar who is being lied to by his vassals.
.... obviously. Of course it's fucking assumption, it's not like I work with the Russian military and am just sharing their secrets on reddit lol. But it's not an assumption that nuclear weapons take a lot of maintenance, and it's not an assumption that Russia has been lacking the maintenance on their military equipment. The assumption was that they are also lacking maintenance on nuclear warheads. That's why I said "IF they have also been neglecting maintenance on their nuclear weapons..." So what's your point? If you were half literate would already know which part are assumptions and which part are assertions.

Incorrect. Here's a legal opinion regarding the state of Washinon. And your example of the DEA was also mentioned in the article as a bad example of comparison due to Federal/State rights.
The Columbia accident report determined that a rescue mission was likely improbable. But, had the damage been known to the astronauts, they could have possibly packed the hole with tools and ice and whatever they could find. There was a spacesuit onboard and a EVA was possible, although it would be unteathered. The “ice team” which predicted impact damage from ice knew that the size and velocity of the detached ice was way outside of their models. They tried to get this across to management with a single, total shit, PowerPoint slide. Don’t use PowerPoint kids.
Feynman actually found out (and mentioned in the Rogers Commission Report) that management assigned a probability of failure to everything, down to the individual bolt, sometimes claiming a probability of failure of 1 in 100 000 000.

I was in 2nd grade. Can only speak for those in my class, but we didn’t completely ‘get’ the seriousness of it all when it happened. One of my classmate’s mom worked at the facility where they built the fuel tanks. She asked someone from NASA to come talk to us about it. It sank in after that.
Korea is also the most likely to actually deliver the goods, plus they're one of the few nations allowing the tanks to be manufactured entirely in Poland, so if they fail to make delivery deadlines it's on them. The western suppliers Poland have been going through are a little preoccupied right now trying to supply Ukraine or beef up their own militaries. I really don't blame Poland one bit, Korea is probably the best bang for your buck if you don't have an arms industry of your own. It wouldn't surprise me if Poland switches to almost entirely Korean weapons. Before the Ukraine war started it made sense to look towards NATO for equipment... but now unless they're at war, the western powers just aren't going to prioritize fulfilling Poland's contracts.
Generally true. In addition it was official policy for decades to not send weapons into active conflict zones.

Inferiority complex. There’s a meme that pops up now and then where it’s EU saying they hate the US and the U.S. saying I don’t even think about you and it’s quite accurate.
Because McCarthy had 2 entire months to count votes, compromise his power to ensure the Speakership, and to know the results of the vote before even going in and he probably hasn't done shit. This reminds me of the 10+ years that Republicans had to come up with their own health care plan to put in place after they tried like 20X to take away Obamacare, and they said they did, but they were actually only interested in taking away Obamacare. All this isn't to say that their isn't nefarious Republican shit going on here where those members said they would vote for McCarthy before voting for Jordan or someone else. Also doesn't answer the mystery of why they would continue to hold 3 additional ballots without actually taking the time to secure those votes, other than this party obviously not understanding the popular definition of insanity.
McCarthy is playing this all wrong. He needs to pull enough Rs minus one or two to vote present for Jeffries. Then threaten them to pull more off to make Jeffries the speaker.

Good starting position. You demand a ridiculously high raise with the offer of letting him fly it. Work your way down to the raise you actually want with the offer of letting him sit in the pilot’s seat for five minutes. Ten if he gives you a extra heart bonus.
Oh I know, World War One is brutal, Im from Canada (which had a huge historic implication for the country) so in high school we spend a good portion learning about World War One and they don’t hold back the turn horrors of that war (and even then I don’t think we went nearly as deep into detail) i can only imagine what the late 30’s to early 40’s would’ve been like for people who had to experience the darkest war of all time, being told and hell maybe even having to be involved with a second one after they ended what they thought would be the War to end all wars.

Also, good luck with the COVID. First time you’ve had it? Just curious because my wife has had it 3 times (nurse), I’ve had it once, and my kids have never had it even though we quarantined in the same house each time. Blows my mind how it can be super contagious yet also I didn’t catch it 2 times when I was sleeping a foot away from someone that had it (and I’m not being sarcastic or downplaying it, it genuinely confuses me because it is contagious as fuck but we didn’t catch it from her).

the pic of the planes in the sky?? i am struggling to see how that's from Arma, it so clearly looks real to my eye, but maybe i'm just crazy and/or blind. is there a different pic on mobile or something?
You are correct. I confused this for the concept of "settler colonial studies" which I looked up between our exchanges. I made a mistake.
So did the Mongols, Celts, Alemanni, Suebi, Slavs, Assyrians, Medians, Turks, Arabs, Magyars and countless other Eurasian peoples that never operated in a feudal system until they adopted it from the realms of the former Roman Empire.

What do you base this of? In Australia (where I live) I mainly see more indigenous people using that term, so I'd assume something similar in Canada.

As far as I know, settler colonialism is a perfectly valid term to describe a country like Canada but also the USA and Australia. The country was colonised and flooded with immigrants who now make up the majority population and control most institutions, with those institutions being modeled on European thinking and not indigenous thinking.

What does that mean? What is an “indigenous” thought? Canadians born in Canada today are now native Canadians. Which specific institutions are “European” thought?

I don't agree with this. For one thing, I don't think indigenous people are uniquely perfect. But indigenous people in the Americas built cities and towns and had agriculture. Although I was incorrect to paint a broad brush that all of them followed socialism when I was mainly thinking of the Haudenosaunee.

No. Just ban hurricanes. Take the liberal NOAA's maps with hurricane arrows pointing at Florida and use a sharpie to draw then going back to sea. Or Cuba or Mexico. Then drop a Nuke on them. Easy.

Honestly it's hilarious. He's legit massively ruined his states economy and they're fudging numbers. The entire event industry has basically pulled out of Florida and Disney's threats to leave are actually becoming real instead of bluster. They've lost hundreds of conferences, events, conventions, etc and more are pulling out every day. I'm two years the state will have basically no event economy at all which the state massively relies on for funding.
I'm guessing Nevada and Arizona have relatively lax gun laws (at least compared to California, but maybe not as lax as Texas), whereas Oregon has stricter gun laws (again, maybe not as strict as California). Further proof that at least part of California's "gun problem" is that guns are being purchased legally in other states and then brought into California.
Considering how large California is, the fact that only 60% of its known guns are coming from in-state purchases I think does somewhat lend to the fact that the gun problem can't be solved completely within California, because a large number of guns are still coming in from out of state. And when you compare it to Texas, where 85% of its known guns are purchased in state, I think it proves that guns are being bought elsewhere and then brought into California.

I may be reading it wrong, but I think we'd have to say that 58% of the guns with known sources are from California. Because 83,781 of the traced guns are from California, and 143,466 of the guns have known purchasers. The other 88,318 guns don't have a known purchaser, so I assume they don't know where they came from (so they could come from California or from another state).

I get that but that still doesn’t address my point. They authorize a bunch of junk, doesn’t mean it does anything productive. Anything that we don’t have money coming in from tax receipts needs to be borrowed. My point is the fiscal mismanagement of our government. I tossed out one example that will clearly get to $100 billion. How many other examples are there like this? What percentage of a dollar spent by the federal government actually does something productive for the citizens and what percentage is pure waste. There seems no accountability for where the money is allocated to and the utility of it. I’m curious how much waste there is. The military industrial complex is clearly a money generating machine for so many but that’s just one component, but a big one. Medicare, while very important isn’t financially well run and we certainly can’t have Medicare for all under our current broken healthcare system. That would only exacerbate a problem. The underlying healthcare system need to be fixed, screw the insurance companies, get the prices to something fair then work on a healthcare fix. I guess my pint is that I think the entire thing is broken. The politicians are all in on the joke, they don’t work together, they don’t do anything productive. They waste money and time bickering and keeping score of gotcha’s with each other. I think the only chance we have is get money out of politics, term limits (money and power corrupt and it’s clear self governance isn’t feasible for these folks) and have systems in place to fire them immediately for corruption, fraud, lying and misleading, like any other job in the US. The Rest of the World wonders how the US has suddenly become a corruption-raddled third world kleptocracy. While there has always been corruption it’s out of hand and not even remotely being disguised anymore.

Eeeeehhhh??,,, any press is good press! Maybe they’ll bring some uppers to stay awake during the meeting, and some flow max to keep the old farts pissing regular, and some benzos to keep everybody, calm, and a little pseudo ephedrine to keep the sinuses dry, and everybody just alert enough to not have to blow their nose,… And may be a little Xanax for the agitated ones.

I strongly agree with those moves. The note you made about barring them from any industry they had purview over is for an even longer period than I've ever heard but I like it. I'd honestly just like to see them barred from the private sector in any capacity for an extended period of at least 7 years. Give them good pay and a good pension after at least 2 terms so they have no reason to go off doing things they shouldn't.

Also, Republican representatives are likely manipulating the Democratic Party hierarchy into making the latter's fiscal politics/policies even more conservative. They all seem to favor big money interests over people.

Absolutely does. However, I imagine we're unlikely to get politicians Nascar-style wearing their owners. By the time we could I'm sure we'd get the much more logical legislation to cut the corruption out.
The military kicks out the miners/woodcutters/landgrabbers (Don't know how to say grilheiro in English =p), the government distributes some food boxes and medical assistance. Politicians take pictures with sick and starving people, the media publishes everything... And a couple months back the miners will be back because the military can't stay there for long without constructing some form of base (Which is illegal in natives lands), the natives are sick and starving because they are locked centuries behind the modern world with primitive agriculture and physics. And the whole circus starts again.
The difference is some politicians use their power to reduce deforestation rates by 80%, protect Indigenous populations, and give food to poor kids, while others use it to line their own pockets, build cults of personality, and irreversibly harm the global climate. And while I can't say I support people doing illegal/unethical things to put themselves back into power, I also think the Lula case highlights why any legal system that puts down a man who uses his power to help others deserves as much skepticism as the man himself.

No. Just let them be be free and they will naturally integrate the society. That happened with basically every single tribe from south Brazil.
More fundementally, Ukraine is a nation-state with soliders, the Iranian protesters aren't even a solid group or organization but rather large unorganized public reactions to police burtality and sexism from the Islamic Regime.
That's your solution? that is not going after the root of the issue. That is not a solution. maybe stop trying to make deals and negotiating? maybe stop your citizens from going to Iran so they can't be used as prisoner swaps and bargaining tools? maybe declare the IRGC as a terrorist organization? how did you take down apartheid south Africa?

Maybe a better option would be to use western intelligence capabilities to sneak a few thousand automatic rifles through the border into Iran so that protesters would have something to push back government forces, instead of stating the obvious by lighting up a useless tower on another continent?

Maybe even shoot a long range missile into Ayotallah's mansion while that shithead is snoring, because they don’t have a nuclear weapon to retaliate, for now, and do the same with other high profile figures of the regime, it’s not like the most of their civilians aren’t supporting a regime change.
"He said Russia would not be able to use nuclear weapons at all if it agreed not to use them first and then came under a nuclear strike. “If it doesn’t use it first under any circumstances, it means that it won’t be the second to use it either, because the possibility of using it in case of a nuclear strike on our territory will be sharply limited,” he said.".
Canada was the 4th largest contributor in the European theatre I think though I wouldn't have called us a superpower, I've heard historians consider France to be one at the time, they got crushed early in the war but the free french never stopped fighting got to do the Undertaker sit up at the end too once it was liberated.

And then what? Fuck Putin, but I do not see a good ending. Russia is so deep into its own Rus nationalism I cannot see how this can end in a good way. Putin's main critics are basically criticising him for not being even more brutal. There is no real opposition in Russia. A lot of people talk Navalny but his coalition is basically only united by "fuck Putin" and completely irrelevant.
The Sanskrit grammatical problem, also known as the Pāṇinian paradox, is a challenge posed by the ancient Indian grammarian Pāṇini in his Aṣṭādhyāyī, a highly technical treatise on Sanskrit grammar. The problem arises from the fact that Pāṇini's grammar is self-referential and recursive, meaning that it refers to itself and can be applied repeatedly. This leads to the question of how the grammar can be complete and consistent, given that it is defined using itself.
Absolutely. When I asked if it was OK to take a summer holiday, my advisor responded by saying that then I could gather less data, assuming my singular goal was to gather more data. She was quite unable to see the human for the human, instead of for a more simple machine.

Sanskrit is perfectly understandable and translateable. It wasn't that Panini wrote cryptically; he'd written what was essentially a linguistics textbook, but included a rule that was incompatible with all of the other rules of Sanskrit grammar. The student's work seems to have just shown that the rule isn't wrong, but rather that it had been misinterpreted, and that the proper interpretation makes it consistent, and thus usable as a shorthand.
In order to expand its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the GRU units transferred many of the documents they stole from the DNC and the chairman of the Clinton Campaign to WikiLeaks. GRU officers used both the DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 personas to communicate with WikiLeaks through Twitter private messaging and through encrypted channels, including possibly through WikiLeaks’s private communication system.
Shortly after the GRU’s first release of stolen documents through dcleaks.com in June 2016, GRU officers also used the DCLeaks persona to contact WikiLeaks about possible coordination in the future release of stolen emails. On June 14, 2016, @dcleaks\_ sent a direct message to @WikiLeaks, noting, “You announced your organization was preparing to publish more Hillary’s emails. We are ready to support you. We have some sensitive information too, in particular, her financial documents. Let’s do it together. What do you think about publishing our info at the same moment? Thank you.”159.

Exactly. They aren’t fast nor stealth and they don’t really have countermeasures for AA from what I’ve read on the internet, basically just off brand guided munition but with a surprising range. And while you can effectively counter them with phased out AA tech and tactics you need a metric fuckton of old guns to cover even the important places of Ukraine which, again, is really big.
I think about it more like...if I was a protestor and I was getting messed with on the streets this is now much more a fight for my life. I will avoid being 'captured' at all costs.
This is basically a hostage situation, they are saying if you want to destroy me, i will kill them, we are all hostage of iran government in iran, when outside of iran asking how's going they give the phone to the one that would say it's fine, the recent protest show the world more than ever how bad the situation is, so they push their government to at least stop helping iran government by negotiating and take more serious action.

Lol you’re just flat wrong. Iran isn’t some unstable pushover country like a war torn Eastern Europe post soviet bloc or poor nation in Africa with tons of infighting. They’ve got a large military, a large population, and the UN would not get involved with that. You’d basically need to count on the US war machine for any meaningful shit to happen and that’s be a direct war that would just make the situation worse.

Yup! I remember being very 👀👀👀👀 about them because of videos of the screens not being properly calibrated and the selection you would make would jump to something else lol. I don't know if it was necessarily nefarious but paper ballots scanned in are just so much more verifiably accurate to me.

These subpoenas are asking who's paying for legal representation, "all documents and communications" about Trump's election PACs (including formation, contracts, funding/use of money), everything related to a nonexistent "Election Defense Fund" (potential money laundering front), and info about Dominion and Smartmatic (potential fraud). Add this into the existing investigations about January 6 itself, fake electors scheme, and the election fraud and it suggests that the DOJ could be looking at whether the Trump campaign itself could be an organized criminal organization.
First, define the fascism. It isn’t an act or method of ignoring or breaking the rules. It’s a tribe, it’s a group, and they’re unifying beliefs that lie underneath what they actually say, because fascists never ever say or debate what they truly believe in good faith. You failed to define this so you’ve decided that the way they break the rules is “fascism.” You have just played directly into their hands. What is it really then? Republican extremism. Christian fascism. Since the rest of the Republican Party always rallies behind the angriest, loudest voice, it effectively IS the entire Republican Party, from top to bottom. Including people who engage in political action, down to electoral volunteers. That’s right, if they’re Republican, they can’t be trusted.
Exactly. It would just be tons of lying bs thrown at Biden and complete disrespect. He has to just tell them to f off. Maybe let a few folks who punch back from his admin testify but mostly executive privilege and ignore the ferals in House GOP.
I just dislike the pigeonholing of any group due to something out of their control. Every individual has something to learn and something to teach. To assume someone is irrelevant or dangerous because they are old, white, black, short, young, etc. is the height of arrogance.
It's fascinating watching brexit spoken about on the worldnews sub as loads of the posters are from nations that wouldn't accept merging their nation into a new state with their nearest neighbours, wouldn't accept unlimited free movement of people from their neighbours or send them billions in cash every year or have swathes of their law making made by their neighbours without a veto and yet the UK is portrayed as somehow being nuts for leaving such a system and doing so by actually asking it's own people to decide.

Only indirectly. He blames them for the 2008 crash, which he believes led to conditions which led to Brexit. You may disagree, but at least disagree with what he actually said.
They're obviously great vehicles and will be put to good use but calling a Bradley a tank killer is laughable. If it's such a tank killer then why do we even have abrams (actual tanks)? they have an auto cannon which will do great work vs the older tank variants the Russians are using but won't do much against modern armor without a bit of luck. They do have missiles but they aren't much more of a tank killer than an nlaw or javeline so it's funny to single the bradley out. I get it's optics though so whatever.
It was mostly about how projects just kept rolling along over budget, the people in charge of them said everything was hunky dory, there were no real consequences for people who were in charge of these floundering projects as long as they stayed in the good old boys club, and there was a revolving door post career between the people in the Pentagon and companies negotiating for contracts.

It’s all part of the same transit system including the subway, and people jump the fare gates and sneak onto the buses already. The transit police don’t enforce the fares.
Nope, they hurt consumers massively, raising prices at the end user point, particularly on any food that isnt specifically subsidized, by raising the opportunity cost of growing anything other than corn, wheat, soya, rice, cotton, sugar, or molasses. Not to mention agricultural tariffs. If we removed all agricultiral subsidies and tariffs, rhe average comsuler would see their grocery bill drop by about 7%. Plus, all these welfare sucking incompetant farmers who cant manage to actually competenin the free market would have to get real jons instead of sucking at the taxpayer teat.

Exactly. Everyone benefits from roads even if they don't travel on them, like trucks that deliver all the goods that people in urban centers consume. But public transit is very limited to benefiting just those in the city. So if they want to make it free then by all means create a city tax to pay for it. But don't put that on everyone else who will never see a benefit from it.

This is happening against the backdrop of the rapid industrialization and scaling up of manufacturing in Vietnam in order to decouple Western economies from China. That president stepping down is sounding to me like Vietnam becoming the modern banana republic, but with product assembly versus fruit production.
Stop? Maybe not but it will force them to change their business model. If drugs were legal in the US cartels wouldn’t be fighting the government they’d be competing with Phillip Morris. Look at just pot, where I live it’s legal as a consequence there are no pot dealers anymore, or rather the ones I knew all either had to shift to drugs that still have a decent markup or are providing a convenient service like home delivery or have shifted to growing their own. There is no mystery just market forces I pay a little more at a dispensary but I know what I am getting, have many more products to choose from and I have literally had a cop hold the door for me when I was walking out of one with a big bag o’ drugs. He smiled and told me to stay safe and have a good weekend. Compared to the time a cop kneeled on my back and cuffed me for having a single joint in my pocket I really enjoyed officer smiley more.
One big thing I really feel is missing on the conversation is, ironically, the historical context as to how the statues got there. One has to realize that humanity didn't really care for historical artifacts that weren't of that persons religion until English and French nobles in the 1700-1800 began popularizing archeology and anthropology of other cultures or ancient civilizations with different religons, and these statues (or the Rosetta Stone) are a perfect example of that.
Maybe they saw the last week tonight piece. It was amazing being in Greece and actually seeing how many pieces were missing and st the British museums. Pretty fucked up.

Personally, I would argue that the best compromise would but let the British Museum keep some of the marbles as a monument to appreciate how humanity came to appreciate ancient civilizations and other cultures and how it (even if unintentionally) ended up saving the Parthenon and countless other ancient Greek sites and artifacts. The other statues would be returned, but the remaining missing niches in Greece would in turn be a reminder of how important valuing and preserving history or risk loosing everything.

Likewise for this example, although many modern Greeks understandably are angry that the statues are not in in Greece, they should also consider how close they came to having lost so many more of them - including the ones still in Greece today. Without British intervention it would not have been surprising if the Ottomans at the time would have fully stripped the Parthenon of marble while the local Greeks would have not interfered as it wasn't as much of a priority of things to fight back on the Ottoman subjugation (as it was a pagan monument and not an Orthodox Christian site).

I highly recommend the last week tonight piece on this. There's literal pictures of British stealing shit labeled loot written by the people themselves. Hopefully something can be worked out.

Basically, it would be like if someone (the Ottomans) was about to use a bunch of paintings as kindling that they had stolen from a down on their luck artist (the Greeks), but a rich guy (Thomas Bruce) ran up them, bought a handful for millions of dollars, which then effectively meant that the rest of the collection became priceless overnight and too expensive to destroy.

As the other guy said. The Ottomans did, and they wanted to scrap this and use it as raw material. It would have been destroyed. Because somebody in Britain PAID for it (not stolen), it has been preserved...
The explosions in late September rocked a key pipeline that carried natural gas from Russia to Europe at a time when Moscow is using energy as leverage in retaliation for Western sanctions over the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.
Hmm. I guess my question would be who was operating our equipment at the time. did we train the Ukrainians? The Finn's? Germans? Or was it just all in a day's work?

European officials were quick to call the incident “sabotage,” and some have cast blame on Russia, although multiple investigations are underway, with Danish and German authorities also collecting evidence.

Yes. One of those suspects of course could have cut the gas line without the use of pyrotechnics, but there are some dedicated ideologues (or paid shills) in here that would love you to believe they decided to blow it up for dramatic effect. Not saying it wasn't Russia, just funny to see all of the people desperate to convince everyone that it was.

Russia denied responsibility. The Kremlin is “extremely concerned,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the same day.
The anti-LGBT rhetoric works for them because LGBT people aren’t born into LGBT families. They don’t necessarily look a certain way that they could be identified as LGBT. This isolates the community to an extent, discrimination against races is easier but also they can’t go too far with it because of changing demographics and attitudes/willingness to tolerate overt racism. LGBT people face bigotry within all races and religions. Because of the coming out process and issues specific to LGBT people we’re sadly in a unique place where bigotry is just tolerated because we as a community are fewer in numbers and spread much more thinly. Also, now that they got what they want from Roe. Their next issue is to “protect” children from gays and trans people. They hide behind this to spread their hate. I see the anti-LGBT rhetoric only getting worse before it gets better.

I want to pause for a second and explain how insanely toxic Fox News is to its viewers. This isn't "right leaning" the way MSNBC leans left. Almost every single detail is propagandized. The graphics, the color scheme, the music... all specifically chosen... when a white Christian conservative is on; the color scheme will literally change to calming whites and blues, with the US flag likely making an appearance. The sound is lower, the speech is slower and softer. When a leftist, Democrat, immigrant, minority, BLM etc. clip is playing the color scheme is red, black, the sound changes. Lastly, and most importantly, some portion of every single day is spent painting Democrats as dangerous lunatics bent on destroying the country. Random Tuesday in 1997 with absolutely nothing to report on? Let's find a 'wacko' college professor who is poisoning America's youth with communism. It has been 9628 days of nonstop rage. If you truly believed what you were watching...why WOULDN'T you hate Democrats and try to stop them no matter what it takes.

That's completely incorrect and I work in this field. Denmark as a party to the Refugee Convention uses the five protected characteristics of refugees in its status determination, one of which is membership of a social group. In many refugee receiving countries, gender (like sexuality) has been considered a social group. This decision just allows gender to formally be used in the Danish determination. It's perfectly legal and not a human rights violation of Afghan men or of any other asylum seekers.

Borderline misinformation. Yes, all the girls and women who are already there. What of the men in their lives already there with them? Goodbye and good luck, please die fighting the Taliban or whatever. I guess if your country's birth rate is already significantly below 2, you'll take all the women you can get.

Nah, that's mostly historical revisionism. Yes, the US historically overstated our overall contribution to WWII (primarily in the European theater though), but this narrative is an overcorrection in the other direction. It's unlikely that the Soviets could've made a meaningful difference that far from their primary front and concentration of logistics and forces and looking at actual Japanese records, the bombs were the largest factor. Specifically, they believed after the first bomb that they could keep fighting, but that was based on the mistaken belief that the US would only be able to make one every several months or longer, and they determined that was an "acceptable" loss rate for the time being (and frankly wasn't that much worse than the firebombing anyways). When we were able to deliver a second one within days rather than months, that changed the understanding.
The Japanese had already humiliated the Soviets/Russians. They had next to no experience or capability to participate in amphibious landings. The US was already at their doorstep, burning down their cities, strangling their supply routes, invading outlying islands. They had the Worlds largest Navy and an enormous and experienced amphibious force. The notion that the Japanese were somehow uniquely motivated by Soviet action is Soviet propaganda.
Judging by the emails I get, you send the suckers your supporters messages like "You have 30 MINUTES to donate to our Official Trump 2024 Victory Fund to receive a 1300%-IMPACT. Don’t wait another minute, Friend. We are counting on you." or "This period of time will go down in HISTORY, Friend, and you will FOREVER be remembered as a LOYAL Patriot that helped your FAVORITE PRESIDENT SAVE AMERICA. Don’t wait a moment longer. Contribute at least $100 IMMEDIATELY to claim your very own copy of OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER before my VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT. " Or flatter them with "Friend, according to my Official Patriot Records, you are one of our movement’s TOP PATRIOTS. When it comes to DEFENDING America from the Left, YOU never waver." The last one is particularly amusing, since I have never voted for or contributed a dime to any GOPer, and especially not Trump. Don't know how I wound up on his mailing list, but it amuses me to no end.

Did you know that only 45% of all UN condemnations are about Israel now? This year Israel-Palestine almost broke the top 25 most violent ongoing conflicts! They need to crank those numbers up.

By then tens of thousands of Jewish militants and self-proclaimed terrorists (Lehi and Irgun) were already ethnically cleansing territory, more than 150000 Palestinians displaced, plus some brutal massacres before May 1948, some of the territory wasn't even allotted to the Jewish state by the UN resolution that Israeli politicians to this day call the "Birth Certificate of Israel".

Wow. I’m thrilled how many comments on this thread are in support of Israel and UNs ceaseless commendations of it for doing what literally any other country would do to defend itself. Here I was being very confident Reddit was an anti semitic cesspool. Stilllll pretty confident but a littttle less now. Feels goodZ.

In the last 24 years they've demolished all their settlements in Gaza (removing 8,000 settlers), legalized 2 previously illegal settlements (built in the 90s, total population <2,000) and moved 1 200 person settlement further away from a Palestinian town.
Researchers have spent decades trying to figure out the secret of this ultradurable ancient construction material, particularly in structures that endured especially harsh conditions, such as docks, sewers, and seawalls, or those constructed in seismically active locations.
This reminds me of one of my college labs. We were split into 2 teams to see who could make the best cordierite (ceramic in catalytic converters) based on the lowest CTE and correct composition. The winner got....something. Can't remember. Maybe bonus points on a test.

During the hot mixing process, the lime clasts develop a characteristically brittle nanoparticulate architecture, creating an easily fractured and reactive calcium source, which, as the team proposed, could provide a critical self-healing functionality. As soon as tiny cracks start to form within the concrete, they can preferentially travel through the high-surface-area lime clasts. This material can then react with water, creating a calcium-saturated solution, which can recrystallize as calcium carbonate and quickly fill the crack, or react with pozzolanic materials to further strenhen the composite material. These reactions take place spontaneously and therefore automatically heal the cracks before they spread. Previous support for this hypothesis was found through the examination of other Roman concrete samples that exhibited calcite-filled cracks.

Under closer examination, these ancient samples also contain small, distinctive, millimeter-scale bright white mineral features, which have been long recognized as a ubiquitous component of Roman concretes. These white chunks, often referred to as “lime clasts,” originate from lime, another key component of the ancient concrete mix. “Ever since I first began working with ancient Roman concrete, I’ve always been fascinated by these features,” says Masic. “These are not found in modern concrete formulations, so why are they present in these ancient materials?”.

Yeah. When I worked in Holland for a while, I was floored with how much EU residents get. Even the lowly service and retail workers. I sent some guy home one day because he was being an ass, and my boss asked why. I told him, and he said, "No, don't do that, he still gets paid, even if he's not here." Top that with sick pay and vacation pay, and somehow, things still run fine and I guess it's profitable since companies stay in business.

Then over the next 15 minutes you need to reprogram your fancy bus' computer to tell it where we're now going because the place you wanted to land at is a no go, calculate how much gas your gonna burn to get there, look at aeronautical charts about the new place, communicate with company to tell them youre going somewhere else, communicate with flight attendant to tell them the people riding the bus are gonna be upset, break your passenger's hearts, use your bus' fancy computer to get the speeds you need to fly your next approach and landing, brief the next arrival and landing, reconfigure the fancy bus' wheels and wings for landing, then land.

I had to go through WC and it absolutely destroyed my career at the company. I was black listed and treated completely differently afterwards. They thought I did it just for the time off. 0/10 workplace environment.
In college I played the game “Risk” with another student from China. We assumed roles leading our respective regions and alliances. I’d never lost so badly. He proceeded to imply that was a natural outcome and perfectly inevitable due to a variety of reasons, but primarily because of the Chinese culture, long history of independence, the size of their population, and their natural superiority regarding trade and adoption of technology to suit their ambitions.
Not really, sadly. At our current level of support for Ukraine, we're really playing catch up in terms of artillery production; to put it into context, we've already given Ukraine all of the Javelins produced in the last 13 years, and they're using more artillery shells in a month than we produce in a year.

My own grandfather, who fought in the resistance in the maquis while he was 18 years old, and did a career in the army after that including a long stay in Berlin always said to me: "The Russians saved us from the Nazi, the Americans saved us from the Russians.".
In reality, the Nazis had beyond shitty tactics and had insufficient high tech weaponry, relying mostly on horses and walking for transport of the majority of troops, and designing hard to repair, overcomplicated machinery whilst taking most people out of factories to fight because they were stupid enough to think they only needed 3 months to win, and thus didn't need supplies or logistics.

We may hope so. It would be the quickest way for Putin to be defeated with the lowest number of Ukrainian casualties. Just that I don't think Putin will be that stupid.

I'm also starting to think that its only a matter of time before fighter jets get involved now, but once again we could see a re-run of the inertia over the tanks that got bogged down in months and months of navel gazing and feet dragging before the British broke the log jam and sent 14 Challengers and then everyone seemed to pile in (although the French are still assessing their contribution it seems).
Trump selfishly set this up for 100% guaranteed failure because he knew Biden had a strong chance of winning if the “rigging the votes “ and coup failed, he could disrupt by Biden trying to pull this off safely (under the conditions, he actually did) - people died from trump childish bullshit (again) but he doesn’t care. In this case you can’t ignore the facts that led up to this pull out and I hope it is exposed because trump should’ve been investigated for the planning and deadlines of this tragic fiasco he planned- but other crimes he committed took precedence ( thinking about it, there must have been hundreds of crimes he committed while in office because we can’t hold presidents accountable while holding office and he could get away with it) - stupid fuckin law and blind spot that needs to be fixed).
I’m glad we got out. It wasn’t perfect but it could have been way worse with what Biden inherited. We had 6,000 total troops when he took over. The numbers were so low that we needed to really depend on local Afghan security forces. This is why we pulled out of Bagram because we couldn’t trust the Afghan military anymore.

Regarding intervention: in a globalized world there's not a single dictatorship that can be toppled without the tacit agreement and support of other countries. That was true for the apartheid regime as it is true now. This is because power is not a national phenomenon anymore: every country participates in granting or denying another power and legitimacy. What the opposition council advocates for is not direct military intervention, but assistance in denying IR this legitimacy on the world stage. Things like: 1) better enforcement of sanctions and punishing people who help IR circumvent them, 2) blacklisting the IRGC, 3) expelling diplomats and walking out of the room when their officials get to speak on the world stage such as the upcoming UNHRC meeting. This must be joined by support such as 1) finding ways to grant internet access (without it the revolution is doomed to fail), 2) use frozen assets of the regime to finance strikes (they cannot strike without money). These are just a few actions and there is no neutral stance in this. A neutral stance in the war in Ukraine in practice would imply a tacit support of Russia. When it comes to toppling IR it's the same.
The only way I could see it working was if the Shah was completely separated from the mechanisms of power, akin to the King of Great Britain (god, it's still weird to type out King as opposed to Queen), where power is more of a formality than function and it resides exclusively with Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office.

As a Christian myself… I don’t agree with the idea that Christians should be controlling anybody through the laws or positions of power… I am human, and I wish everyone could agree with me, but I know that can never happen, nor would it be a good thing… These “Christians“ Who want Christians to have all of the power in the world to make laws against those who don’t agree with them missed the point that Jesus made that our kingdom is not meant to be here on earth… Our job is to get you into the new kingdom, not one that we create physically on earth.

Hi. Non american here. After the shit show has ended for now there is something I still don't understand. Is McCarthy no longer a MAGA republican? What did he do to be excomunicated from the cult? Or they just abandoned him for no reason and just Made him an undesirable?

Not necessarily. I'd bet one republican's crossover vote is worth MORE to a prospective dem speaker (Hakeem Jeffries, for example) than any 'safe' dem vote. Therefore, if you were a middling republican w/o a decent committee assignment and were willing to step over the isle because your math says you'd gain more support from your district by showing you were a candidate more willing to work with the other party, I'd bet you could negotiate for a BETTER assignment from the incoming Dems than the garbage assignment(s) you are holding today.

Pipe dream. The working class in this country has no solidarity because it's been successfully set to war against itself. We can't even get people to realize or accept how bad climate change already is. We still laugh at people trying to find ways to bring attention to it.

IT's like the people still defending Alex Jones. The man even said he now "believes" Sandyhook was not faked. Yet, screams: "Please give me money they are going to make me live on the streets because I loved to take other people's money and enjoy their misery." Those people just can't get the point that a crazy person killed children. Because you know, it hasn't happened before or the fact that you know, people are killed for the most petty things imaginable. So, they believe in a con man when they have NO connection with the shooting or family members there. Hell, Andrew Pollack who wrote "Why Meadow Died" which is actually a pretty good book. Still blames Obama and democrats for his daughter's death. Yet goes on Fox and other TV saying how the GOP is useless and Trump lied to him and so did Betty DeVos about fixing the system. Especially after Uvalade. But in his mind: "If they would have just stopped that program my daughter still be alive." Yet, he told Jones that he was "full of shit". Did he go after him or strike up to counter speech him? Nah, he ended up supporting the same GOP that believed in Jone's lies and watched as other people were harrassed and even mentally beaten into submission that the shooting never happened, even if they were related to the children being killed.

Nobody is disbanding political parties. Just the People’s Party is temporarily taking control of the government and making them work for the People for a change. Purging the criminals.
you are right in my cynicism. to expand, i believe in the world, not managers. i also believe that to become a politician, one has to be deceptive, self-centered, and seeking power over others. this requires a high level of grandiosity. every once in a while, someone with integrity makes it. still, i see them as benevolent assholes because they insist on gaining power. the conditions for the benevolent asshole to gain power are rare, so politicians with integrity are the exception. the one politician i will believe is the one whose sole aim is to give more power to the people so they can decide their path rather than take advantage of their power to materialize their personal ambitions, whether seemingly altruistic or malicious.
3). Cuba assassinates Putin. Says they want the US and Cuba to get along. All Americans think Cuba is a bro and all is forgiven. Cuba holds elections and goes full democracy. Sanctions are lifted. Party in Cuba!

Has a constitution and three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Laws are created by the legislative branch, then implemented by the executive branch. The judicial branch ensure laws are in-keeping with the constitution.
There was their Red River Rebellion before that. That resulted in the creation of the Province of Manitoba. This was before Louis Riel started branding himself as a prophet.
Frankly, these people leaving the field as a result of being underpaid and the incredibly stressful working conditions resulting from working in an underfunded education system seems like a fairly obvious outcome. Given that it's the Ford government that continues to both cut education spending and both direclty and indirectly supporting private schools it would almost seem that it's intentional and is being done specifically to seek that end.

3. I like how you quoted me saying that wages aren’t the driving force of inflation but then responded as if I said wages don’t affect inflation.

Please refer to my earlier point about how inflation outpaces wage increases, hence being moot and providing no actual benefit. If wage increases caused inflation, why are inflation rates considerably higher than wage increases?

Also, there is literally no job on planet earth where a 1% raise a year is not a literal decrease in pay; even inflation rates that are considered economically acceptable/healthy are like 2-3%. Doesn’t matter if you’re a CEO or a fry cook, that “raise” is a pay decrease.

Thank you. Also I'm a "she". I guess I wasn't as clear on my point and you cleared it up. I don't like Nancy Pelosi, but I would vote for her 50 million times before I voted for anybody on the GOP side. But you know what fucked us over with the Supreme Court? RBG not retiring the minute Obama won his 2nd term. The elderly need to get out of the way, as soon as they have security to do so. Stop waiting until you either die in the seat or get out voted by the other side. Start mentoring and supplying money to younger, more educated folks. The system is broken but they're still acting like it works like it did in the 1950s. It doesn't.

Russia did, and has made wiping out the Ukrainian people and their national identity a major cornerstone of their war.
You've already acted as an apologist for Russia and it's attempts to eradicate the Ukrainian nation. Don't pretend you care.

I never mentioned Afghanistan and you can try to convince yourself as much as you want that Iraq 2003 and Ukraine 2022 are not the same but at the end of the day, they were both illegal acts of aggression by a large country, against a smaller sovereign nation without international approval, against international law and the UN charter.

It's not quite that cut and dry. Trademarks don't automatically enter or remain in the public domain the way patents and copyrights do. In 1950, anyone could have used the ancient Greek term/persona "Nike" to advertise anything. Once the actual corporation Nike was formed and filed for the trademark for clothing, no one else could. Trademark law differs from country to country, but generally, the IOC would likely have a legal right to stop others from calling their events "The Olympic Games" without any kind of clarification.
They actually earnestly believe that the 'sinners' will suffer literally infinitely more over the course of eternity, so they fully believe they are "rescuing" them from eternal torture by forcing them to suffer on earth. The rationale is, a little material suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of christ on the cross - it is our privilege to suffer for jesus on earth so we can spend eternity with him in heaven.
What? The outgoing are crazy high. Going with your arguments, members of church doing specific duties don't go unpaid. Priests cardinals and other high ranking clergy are given a stipend as well as room and board for their work. Volunteer fire fighters get less for their efforts. Actual doctors who work catholic build hospitals are paid. The govt assistance they get is not being taxed in many places while many others do tax them.

Look at the type of poll Republicans are flooding the media with right aligned polls all showing Republicans up while non-partisans like Marist, NYT and Monmouth are showing democrats up. So places like RCP and 538 are showing skewed results because of this flooding. The polls don’t seem to match reality when it’s coming to early voting numbers and it’s being theorized that young voters and new voters in 2018-present aren’t being accurately represented because they don’t count as “likely voters” because LV is usually adjusted for voting in at least the past 3 elections. You also have these partisan polls under counting the youth. The IA poll that came out right after the PA senate debate showed Oz up by 3 but their weighted sample of young voters which their range they used was 18-39 was only 14% even though normal participation on average is 20-28%. That’s not even counting that they used a massive age range and under weighted while had a majority of their respondents be white people between 40-64.

Yes, but 12 tanks is barely enough for a (smaller sized) company, with no replacements for losses. For reference, on paper, Ukraine fields 31 mechanized infantry brigades and 7 active and reserve armored brigades. Ukraine will take anything they're given right now, but 12 modern tanks is not that significant in the grand scheme of things. Ukraine and Russia are fighting along a 2000km front with 100,000s of men on both sides. What Ukraine might contemplate doing with the Leopard 2s, to the enormous headache of their logistics and maintenance personnel, is disperse them among numerous platoons, and field a high-low mix of tanks, where the modern tanks' better sensors, rangefinders, and sights provide targeting info for the guns of the older tanks and for supporting artillery and drone units.
This was my thought. What is the tooth to tail ratio for the Russian military? Also, you usually have to train support troops. I guess they don't die at the rate that front line fodder does, but still. 2 weeks hardly seems adequate to train a conscript for a support position.
Like my 4 decade of awareness of their existence has only shown me they're rich, oppressive assholes. The only thing they have going for them is they try not to be publicly dicks. They manage to do much of that in private.
Japan has been advocating for it to become the "sixth eye", which I don't think will ever happen - if only because the US wants to keep ROK happy and as an ally, so that means holding Japan at arms lenh (since neither Japan nor Korea will tolerate being in a close alliance together, given their history).

Yeah we were sold out from politicians. Maybe they figure they can nationalize some of these companies assets if shit hits the fan but it will be too late by then if your population has been brainwashed thanks to a favorable algorithm to be sympathizers to Chinese and Saudi influence.

Poland has Aegis ashore. That's a tech that the US shares with very few countries. I think the only countries that have been granted export licenses for Aegis systems are the UK, Canada, Australia, Norway, Spain, Japan, Korea, Romania, and Poland - with Poland and Romania operating the land-based Aegis Ashore. That should give you a hint as to where Poland ranks among US allies.

Good. I for one am tired of people using their color crayons on the flag. It doesn't need it. The colors it has are fine. The design is fine. We don't need people's faces on it. We don't need coloring on the lines. It's just not necessary. It's a good design just like it is. So leave it the fuck alone because it's a good looking flag and doesn't need any help.

wow. grew up seeing that flag, that bumper sticker, that sign, everywhere. all the movies and media on it. my dads vet friends all telling me their support groups were sounding more and more like new episodes of tour of duty and china beach every week. my dad was a 2 tour marine there. in the early war he never watched any of those shows.

My work(manufacturing) stopped testing for thc at pre employment and when out sick for more than a week but will if you cause someone to get hurt. Not sure if they test for thc via blood or urine now though since they have adopted a more lenient policy on thc since they allow people to have their medical card and use cannabis just not at or before work and do random blood draws and test for thc.
same! i work in a high-hazard industry and we’ve had a handful of openings for over a year. no one can manage to not smoke long enough to pass a urine test, despite the good wages and job stability. i’m pro not taking drugs before being in a highly dangerous environment so response times are great, but i’m also pro not drinking before being in a highly dangerous environment for the same reason. and apparently that’s not as big of a deal to many employers. instead, we’ll just be short-staffed, which isn’t safe either.

Oh the young! You have the numbers with millenials and Gen Z please use your numbers to take control from the failed boomers. I am a boomer hoping you flex your muscle and make your future into something better than my generation managed. The damage we are doing as we die off is just terrible.

As commented here by others, young voters largely support legislation including pro-choice and green/environmental issues, which essentially eliminates the Republican party from the discussion. Boomer and Gen X Republicans still clinging to the old ways don’t have the numbers or a even a viable agenda to carry them into the future. Flailing incompetents like Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan and batshit crazy MTG and Bohbert will finish off what’s left of the GOP.

Often times in Israel, I see Reuters report in an heavily biased manner, where for example, if a Palestinian 13 year old pulls out a knife and starts stabbing random Israel, and promptly gets shot for it, the title would usually be "IDF has killed a Palestinian kid"?

Edit: I tried to search up the incident 3 days ago where a 14 year old Palestinians stabbed someone to death, but despite having 5 different articles about Israel that day, it somehow didn't make the news.

Ha! Honestly this one is easy. This was new to me as a New Zealander, but in Ukraine, the gas stations often had hot dog stands. Which was revelatory. So I would say the best sandwich is on the road in Eastern Ukraine, from any open gas station, with an American hot dog in fresh bread. But if we’re going homestyle, I’m a huge roast beef, mustard and pickle fan. KV.
Unfinished construction has been one of the big stories out of Sochi, fueled by tweets from journalists who have been meticulously documenting every exposed wire, uncovered manhole, broken curtain rod and makeshift shower curtain along the way.

"In October, in advance of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Human Rights Watch reported that security forces have been arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to ill-treatment in detention in the country. Human Rights Watch interviewed six LGBT Qataris, including four transgender women, one bisexual woman, and one gay man. All said that Preventive Security Department officers detained them in an underground prison in Al Dafneh, Doha, where they were verbally harassed and subjected to physical abuse, ranging from slapping, to kicking and punching until they bled.".
So um.. does Iran think hunger makes people more cooperative? Anyway, these women are already risking their lives and they know it.. I don't think this is very impactful.
Iran is much more of a pariah state on the international scale moreso similar to North Korea, and despite it's people being largely liberal historically especially relative to Arab societies, the government much more strictly enforces things like forced hijab relative to Arab countries.

True. There not much acceptance. Buuut, where can xou pay with gold? Or where can you pay with your currency in kther countrys? There you also need an exchange, like with bitcoin. For now it's more like an store of value. Medium of exchange might come over time.

Funny how the past few days the international headlines were all about vague (and subsequently false) statements from one member of the judiciary in Iran pretending the morality police isn't a branch of the judiciary and using that as a loophole to say the morality police is abolished and headlines ran with that, as if the world somehow didn't understand that the Iranian regime, like many dictatorships, is built on lies and false promises which only lead to eventual even greater oppressions.

I didn't say it was all good. He did plenty of bad too. But he was definitely the destabilizing factor France needed for major change to be possible post Emperor. That major change helped spread more democratic values throughout Europe.
what are you talking about? the only way yall get any chance at throwing the tories out before 2025 is if you make them too scared to remain in government. what are you gonna buy or not buy to trigger a GE?
Well when you go through 3 leaders in a year, two of them failing due to massive amounts of ineptitude, and two of them being elected by the party rather then the people, with the current one being a rich bastard who is already in a huge disconnect with Britain (likely due to being rich and not having to worry like the rest of us) and then combine that with there not being an actual election until 2024, it’s gonna make people not give a shit.

What about this makes things better long term? A one time pay increase is going to be inflated away shortly. Not allowing workers to be laid off makes the government less efficient. Both requests obviously increase inflation.

Because really? We’re seriously at the point where someone can just blatantly lie about their entire life, hide their criminal history from another country (where the case is still open), get elected to Congress, and still be allowed to take the seat, and there’s no recourse other than hoping and praying that the people who live in that seat see anything wrong with it? When this guy likely committed several crimes in the process (lying on campaign disclosure forms, for starters). What kind of country are we running here?

Probably. I mean first they were associated with a congressperson, then a fraud, now their brand is inextricably entwined with scandal.
We are the only country in the world that has the gun suicide rate as high as we do. We are the only country in the world that has the murder rate from guns as high as we do. We’re the only country in the world that has as many mass shootings as we do. We’re also the only country in the world that has as many guns with a lack of training and respect for those guns as we do. I say that to assuage the “well akshually the Israelis and Swiss..” comments because their populations have forced service in their militaries where the US has a voluntary military service. The problem here is both the easy access to guns as well as the lackadaisical approach to gun ownership we have. It’s a right granted to us but we don’t honor that right by treating it with respect.
Absolutely shameful pandering. We can do better things with our resources like try to get basic government functions such as healthcare, passport offices, and immigration to work. My country is falling apart at the seams and they are dickin’ around trying to take hunting equipment.
I’m excited to see our Gov spending their time banning videos of people’s cats & dogs doing funny things. Maybe they could pay attention to the 10M registered voters that are waving their arms asking someone, anyone to investigate stock market manipulation. Hedge Funds/Market makers control the market like a god damn video game, stealing millions of dollars from retail investors daily. Maybe they could have some serious conversations about our energy policy. All these fuckers do is bicker and then spend time banning an App that is utilized by unproductive people. What secrets is China gonna steal? The perfect ratio if Mentos to CokaCola? WTF is wrong with our elected officials???

Edit: wait 48 states use the electoral college. IMO it’s okay to discriminate based on knowledge of the job and cognitive abilities. I’ve worked in fast food and if you can’t add up the change (you’d be surprised how many teenagers can’t) you won’t get the job. It sucks that so many people are uneducated in this country but you don’t have to let them run a country just to avoid discrimination based on intelligence. Intelligence isn’t a protected class.

Sometimes difficult decisions have to be made. Armenia keeps getting beaten up by Azerbaijan and Russia wants to stop this. If Armenia blocks access, Azerbaijan will attack Armenia, they will win and they will kill Armenians, destroy infrastructure and take the land. No one will do anything about it.
Region:Armenia, Karabakh, Azerbaijan, RussiThe Armenian authorities have announced for the first time at the highest level that their strategic ally Russia is forcing Armenia to provide a corridor—through its sovereign territory—to Azerbaijan, as well as to join the Union State of Russia and Belarus, reported the RFE/RL Armenian Service.

The law is clear. An agreement was already signed (no corridor language except for Lachin corridor) in Nov 2020 that ended the war. It was reaffirmed in jan 2021. This is simple, Russia wants a route to/from the meditarrean that has no international controls and to solidify its relationship with Azerbaijan while blackmailing Armenia into being its military outpost.

Look at a map. Azerbaijan needs access through Armenia to get to part of its country. There's a large enclave with a portion of Armenia blocking access.
>The Shah and his prime minister had an antagonistic relationship. Part of the problem stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh was connected by blood to the former royal Qajar dynasty, and saw the Pahlavi king as a usurper to the throne. But the real issue stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh represented a pro-democratic force that wanted to temper the Shah's rule in Iranian politics. He wanted the Shah to be a ceremonial monarch rather than a ruling monarch, thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah. While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly, Mosaddegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote (the latter which the Shah supported as well) in order to block the Shah's ability to act. As a result, the oil nationalization issue became increasingly intertwined with Mosaddegh's pro-democracy movement.
No. They're still allowing inspections required under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The inspectors/inspections they refused are the ones covered by the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA). Since the US and Europe have violated the JCPOA it's no longer functional and Iran doesn't feel it's obligated to honor its commitments under it. They are, however, still honoring the NPT (presuming the 84% enriched uranium is for peaceful purposes.).
Makes sense. We are really good for exporting our armoured vehicles. Unfortunately, we have this terrible habit of selling them to the Saudi regime to be used to kill Yemeni.

Exactly. Probably Romania, Poland, Baltics. It would make sense to build there and just ship them over the border. Russia cannot attack the factories as they are on NATO soil. Not sure about the Baltics, but Poland and Romania have large military factories from the Cold War. They could be upgraded and start producing equipment with a very short turnaround time.

Without oversimplifying things. Recycling is just reheating it back up to make the atoms movable again and removing the parts that you don't want.

metals can't be "polluted" Once you throw all of that scrap into a furnace, there are processes to separate/remove the undesirable parts out. There are no exceptions when it comes to metals. Plastics are a different story.

Your analysis of Russian equipment goes against western analysis which has Russia with a 6 to 1 artillery advantage Ukraine claimed to need 5x what it has received in order to gain artillery superiority over Russia and including all donations Ukraine has only a few hundred active tanks maybe 1500 tops counting captures and donations and not counting losses there has been at least 200 losses that have been recorded.

This is never a true. It is always cheaper to recycle metal vs getting it from the earth. Raw earth is a mix of all elements, not just iron. You have to mine it, transport it, separate it, and process it. Scrap metal has already gone through all of that. Melting it down will always be less resource and energy intensive.
why not both? Shitty gov't is usually a product of apathetic or moronic voters. A symptom and not a root cause. Better-educated populace (basic education) would lead to better candidates to vote for.
Lol what it’s true. I’m liberal as fuck myself, but this is absolutely what Apple look for when employing staff because they know that’s how us young people relate. Apple ain’t trying to Apple to fucking old farts.

We'll see how it plays out, my understanding was that with the adjusted way bargaining works, 'minor' players like RAFFWU or other grass-root organised groups have less of a say in the bargaining table / consideration given to their claims than the larger, more recognised shoppers (who can eat a dick as far as I'm concerned).

Well done. I don't care who you vote for, but we desperately need more voters like you. You don't have to vote for a major party because you think you're vote will be wasted. Think of it as building the seats up of your chosen minor for the future. It may not happen now, but if enough people desert the majors, things will change, major parties can become minor ones.

2. Peace negotiations are an obvious ploy and it's weird that you can't at least acknowledge that perspective. Negotiations mean compromise, and compromise means giving something to Russia that they don't deserve because wars of aggression should never be rewarded, ever. This is very fundamental to my view of international relations. And I would argue that being rewarded for aggression is specifically what Putin wants out of this whole affair. Furthermore, the idea of "peace talks" suggests, falsely, that both parties have some level of fault in the cause of the conflict. They do not. This was a war of choice on Russia's part and Ukraine did nothing at all which would justify their complete invasion and destruction. Ukraine does not want to attack Russia, therefore any "peace talk" is a sham - end of story. This is 100% on Russia, and the only acceptable peace is that they accept to retreat from the war that they alone started unjustly.
In Biden's case (from the reports that we currently have), they found the documents, notified the proper agencies, and transferred them ASAP. In Trump's case, he lied about having them, refused to turn them over, and has repeatedly fought to have the government turn the classified documents back over to him calling them his property. That shows much more intent than "someone made a mistake, here are these documents back.".
325 Documents were recovered from Mar-a-logo after repeated requests for return from the National Archive. Trump's lawyers even signed official statements claiming Trump didn't have the documents.

Having documents isn't the crime Trump is accused of. Refusing to return documents and obstructing efforts to retrieve documents is the crime Trump is accused of.

Correct, it is the willful retention of the documents that makes Trump's actions criminal. The National Archive formally requested the documents back and Trump refused.

technically dwight eisenhwwer created our land based highways and shipping infrastructure through national highway legislation, regardless of the fact that there were hundreds of individual networks on loosely interconnected roadways prior to the national highway act. sure, anyone could have proposed and passed that legislation and its not like he invented cars or anything....
I think it means we need to look past headlines and scrutinize what's actually being done, because as I read this article it's just two random house Republicans saying some platitudes about "orderly legal immigration" being a good thing occasionally. Talk is cheap and Republicans lie like breathing.
The Democratic party is the party of humane, reasonable, and economically literate immigration policy. But sometimes Democrats say "Latinx" so these folks will complain a little about Republican immigration policy but will keep voting for the GOP anyway, because god forbid people have any sense of reasonable priorities in politics.

Oh, I totally agree. I used it in quotes because we are obviously discussing words in speech and text. Latine obviously makes more spoken sense. I was just noting I’m not sure “Latinx” was ever intended to be a spoken word by those who first used it; more like internet slang. I have no stake in the debate, but I think its an interesting nuance to consider as an example of the flexibility of language in different contexts and mediums.
Why not Estonia, Latvia and Luthuania then? My point is, one more border wouldn't make any real difference. Plus Ukraine did offer to drop NATO membership, Russia declined and ask for land, makes me think NATO membership was a handy excuse at a time, since we never really heard about it again after.
If main war goal was to stop NATO expansion why no accept a peace deal where Ukraine drops NATO application? And why 4th border matters but not previous 3? This still makes no sense to me, they were handed their goal on a silver plate and they refused. As well as USA or NATO will invade Russia, can someone really believe that anyone in the world, maybe besides China, wants that massive territory with millions of insurgence rih after Afganistan, especially since Russia has nukes and submarines, planes, maybe ships carrying nukes and cruising around the world at all times, nuclear proof shield is a fantasy at this day and age.

1. As Christians, we must save those ppl trapped by protestanta and heretics! They don't know any better.
It really is crazy though to see how much warning Stalin received from his intelligence network, and others, though. .
soviet union did not have the money, public support or export capacity to sustain a prolonged conflict, so they resorted to a military doctrine of nukes first on all scenarios, which led to a US policy of total retaliation, which kept both countries relatively at bay.

Look. Fuck Stalin. He was a horrible leader and person. He genocided both the Ukrainians and Kazakhs and ethnically cleansed many more ethnic groups (plus purging every leftist group that didn't support him, the Bolchevicks included).

This. According to Kotkin’s second volume on Stalin, Stalin tried very hard to make pacts with the Britain but Churchill was vehemently anti-communist. Fearing Japanese expansion in the East, Stalin felt it best to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany so that he could focus on the East (we now know the Japanese at the time did not have intentions of invading the USSR). It seems he knew a war would breakout in mainland Europe and the hope was that Germany, Britain, and France would destroy themselves in the conflict; which, would enable to socialist uprising in these countries.

They'd all sell their tacky MAGA shit to start trapping and making beats to get rich like their new god hero merely because a top 10 Q-Anon influencer was having a slow week and falling behind on rent, so she made a suggestive video wildly misinterpreting a Dre lyric about getting his dick sucked "liberally" or something, then highlighting his conservative bonafides like being a CEO of a huge company he created, a legacy of homophobic lyrics, and credible accusations of violence against women in public. There would be so many bad Republican thug life videos and memes for a while, many of which would inexplicably and mistakenly use pics of Ice Cube. Conspiracies would abound that Snoop was Q, Death Row was a front for white hat conservative lunatics, and that Eazy-E was going to be reincarnated as JFK Junior.
Why? The war started as a civil war when the Houthi Militia broke their agreements with the coalition government they were a part of and mobilized their soldiers. KSA only gets involved after the Houthi Militia, backed by Iran, overthrows the legitimate government and attacks KSA.
An Iranian controlled Yemeni state would present significant problems for the KSA's military as if Iran wanted to attack they could much more easily through Yemen.

The had a treaty with the legitimate government of Yemen to intervene if they were attacked. As the Houthi, who are backed by Iran, attacked the legitimate government that drew KSA into the conflict. It is fairly normal IR stuff.

Just like Russia is not responsible for current disagreement between Czechia and Poland, even though they literally conquered both countries and ruled them for entire second half of 20th century, In exactly the same way, Europe is not responsible for the current conflicts just because they interfered sometime after WW1.

Oh no. Not this shit again. The Saudis are doing the exact same thing in Yemen that the Russians are doing in Ukraine. In fact, the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen have been called a war crime by the UN and the US and allies who want the world to support Ukraine because of "morals" are also supplying weapons to the Saudis and buying oil from them.

1.	The original government is the one imposing the blockade (debatable term as food and aid does get through, but no fuel to transport over fears of the fuel being stolen by Houthis and used to fund their war). Saudi works with the OG and helps enforce the blockade, allowing certain humanitarian ships through. The Saudis, and this is not my exact perspective, can be seen simply as enforcing a legitimate countries wishes.
RTPCR should be taken 5 to 7 days after exposure. Surely some of them have false negative results. The positive results are probably those who already have the virus before the flight.
Which is immune system dysfunction/regulation. But you are correct, we are seeing this happen with COVID 19 patients. And we will be here for decades upon decades constantly discovering the long term effects of this (and all) viruses.

Exactly. This entire thread is just Americans who are assuming that EU/European regulations are as bad as theirs. The EU has plenty of laws on these things and the foreign workers are seasonal workers to help with farming/agriculture because the domestic population aren't willing to fill in all the gaps in those sectors.

Or you lost the battle. As a last ditch effort to rid the virus, your own body/immune system creates an environment that is so incredibly volatile that it kills itself. The virus will also die as it can not live in a dead body. But that’s not good news for you because you also can’t live with a dead body.

Yup there are even those of who are ethnic Chinese who are anti-China (well, more specifically the government, their overly sensitive nationalistic trolls, the scammer organizations, and the money-worshipping nouveau riches who are snapping up properties in other countries and pricing the locals out of their own homes).

And maybe some that will work. At the end of the battle your body has destroyed the virus and the baby viruses they “birthed”. You might have battle scars though, damaged lung tissue for the rest of your life. But your soldiers now know how to kill it and will get a nice tenure at the battle school to make sure future soldiers have this information.
One concern is the January 6 committee had documents with witness names they agreed to keep secret for their safety. They had to turned all this over to the White House for classifications to keep those people safe because they didn’t trust that the GQP wouldn’t go after those people for retribution. This is absolutely wild.

So, it's another space race. This time it's China vs. US. Nothing like a challenge to get the team spirit going. Seems to me solar makes more sense than nuclear for long-term habitation. But I'm just a sci-fi dweeb. Also thinking long-term leapfrog potential for other projects. But, I'm just a dweeb.
The problem is how much energy can be stored at once for example the moon spins on it's axis once every 27.3 days.even if we cna store it in this case a base it should be simple for a base but then in emergency situations(I am not sure if there ever will be one I am no expert either) you won't have more capacity than you already have.my point is nuclear reactor makes us more flexible while solar energy can be used as a secondary source(as I said I have no qualms with solar energy in fact relying on one type is always result in fault).

That's cool. So, helium-3 and nuclear fusion is a very different story from the headline. The other side of the moon seems like a safer location for an experiment that could result in an explosion 100 times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Japan to end WWII.
A video of Iranian fans unfurling a large Ukrainian flag in the stands during the game was posted online.
Exactly. China gains nothing from Russia gaining land in the West. They will 'help' Russia after they lose by buying mineral extraction rights in Siberia and the Far East (at a discount price, of course). China will set up company towns which they will have significant control over.

Interesting article. The elephant in the room though is whether Russia is willing to stop short of taking all the oblasts it has annexed.

Different government. The Chinese government that was around when the Japanese took over Manchuria is now the government based on Taiwan. The current government based in the mainland China owes it survival to Japan invading when it did and being able to largely do the bare minimum, while the government in charge took heavy casualties doing the majority of the fighting. After the war, the truce between the CCP, and the KMT that governed China at time ended, with the CCP driving the weakened KMT troops to Taiwan with the help of Soviet aid and weapons it took from Japanese stocks in Northeastern China. The CCP formed the current Chinese government telling Ukraine that it should give up land for peace. But you wouldn't know it from the World War 2 films produced in China. It would make you think it did the lion's share of the fighting with the Japanese.
In addition to packing (concentrating a voting bloc into a single district to reduce their influence in other districts) and cracking (spreading a voting bloc among many districts to deny them a sufficiently large voting bloc in any one district), both of which focus primarily on the relationship of voters to district lines, there are also two other tactics not as frequently discussed which focus on the relationship of candidates to district lines.
Sure! They could and would do a whole lot of shenanigans. The law would become super conservative, but the constitution would remain the same. In your example, they might remove student IDs as valid and add gun licenses.

Exactly. And here's the thing, he is going to lose that seat anyways, it's west Virginia. And the fact he voted on Bidens spending package alone is going to be a big pill to swallow for one of the most heavily leaning red states we have. His seat is up in 2024.

Gerrymandering FTW. Democracy disappears in Wisconsin, and it’s going to happen in more and more states, and at the federal level. Voting will no longer be required.
Are you an "ethnic Ukrainian" or an "ethnic Russian" if you come from both sides of the border - which is the case for many, many people in Russia and Ukraine?
We largely define ourselves by our nationality (with the exclusion of ethnic minorities like Crimean Tatars, Cossacks of Don or of Zaporozhye etc) and not our ethnicity. Given the shared history of our two countries, it's nearly impossible to even determine it. The poster above was most likely referring to the Russian-speaking people from the eastern parts of Ukraine (they were evacuated the most) who nevertheless define themselves as Ukrainians, so calling them "ethnically Russian" would be incorrect and even kinda crass tbh. It is also the basis of Putin's propaganda and the backlash of a Ukrainian one: Russian-speaking Ukrainians from the East (especially Donbass territory) are often marginalised and called "rusnya" (racist slur for Russians) by their Ukrainian-speaking compatriots, so it's just hurtful all around.

Probably a bit of both. I know I've read of many folks finding that the safest way to escape or avoid conflict have fled to Russia and many of them are then fleeing Russia to other countries. I think travel in and out and through Ukraine is a challenge due to obvious risks, but also restricted travel options (flying, trains, busses, etc).

Relatives. A lot of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia, seeing that we used to be one country at some point, and after the division the border control and immigration policy were very lax until about 2012-14. Think like Canada-US interconnectedness, it's about the same - used to be.

No, it isn't. This clearly T-bones both _Heller_ and _Bruen_ and there is no way it will make it past the federal courts. All Senators who are lawyers already know this.This bill is pure theater and it is intended to distract the Dem base (I are one) from noticing that since the _Dobbs_ decision, Democrats have now failed at every major policy initiative they have had for the past 50 years. So let's waste time on a futile performative gesture which is certain to fail, and alienate over a hundred million peaceful, responsible gun owners in the process. Great.

Incorrect. While I agree with you that shutting down that strike was wrong, this incident wouldn’t have been prevented with increased sick leave. It happened because the rail companies are using fewer workers and longer, less adequately manned trains. The strike didn’t address that issue, it addressed a symptom of it. It wouldn’t have stopped rail companies from running the trains the way they do.

For Republicans the derailment was ideologically incorrect. Private business is good, regulation is bad. Events which expose their ideology as false or grossly incomplete are intolerable, they have to be eliminated. Hence the conversion story.
If they can build up a manufacturing base in Africa and create a stronger middle class there they have a billion person population to sell cheap goods. This will mitigate some of the population decline they are experiencing. Additionally countries like Vietnam and India are replacing Chinese manufacturing for the US. The only other region that is non-aligned at the moment is South America. It looks like Brazil and Argentina are hedging as Peru and Chile are working through a massive push for socialist policies. Many other nations in South America are exploring how to mitigate the damage of capitalism with more socialism. We are in worldwide changes right now.
That is incorrect for Germany, to the extent that Germany doesn't even have a constitution but a Grundgesetz (Basic Law), which was drafted by the Parlamentarischer Rat (Parlament Council) in Bonn in 1949, made up of German politicians, which was summoned by the Ministerpräsidenten (Heads of Federal States) after being asked to do so by Allies.
They were not "Russia-assisted". They were literally active duty Russian soldiers. 2/3rd of the unit that shot it down were made up of active duty Russian soldiers from Russia in unmarked uniforms according to the Dutch investigation.
Regulatory capture. If governments stand in the way of corporations, then absorb the government into the corporation so that the goals of both align. No more government in the way. This is why I cringe when people suggest the government should be run like a business. No, no it shouldn’t.

Russia engaged in an unprovoked attack on a so reign nation and has committed numerous war crimes, including satisfying a number of definitions of genocide (mass kidnaps of children, ethnic cleansing, indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets). Each of these companies, and the C-execs that lead them, needs to be held accountable.

Can these ships be identified from these satellite images? Or alternatively followed to determine where they came from? Or is the traffic too dense there?
The companies apparently have all the data archived, and the satellites almost certainly cover the entire Baltic Sea as well as the world to the extent of their orbital inclination, so it should be very possible to backtrack and forward track those two ship's courses over several days, especially forward.

I do yes. Blowing up a bridge is far easier than something beneath water, especially when the target is in your backyard. You keep apparently forgetting how far out of the way the pipelines were and still are for Ukraine.

And lastly don't forget there is still flowing gas through the Ukrainian pipelines from Russia to EU. If Ukraine really wanted to hurt the Russians with the gas supply they would've blown up their own lines, easier to access and bigger result, as they're still being used to transport gas. And easy to blame on some failed Russian missile or partisan sabotage.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly. Rich people can be assholes. Poor people can be assholes to poor people. But poor people cannot be assholes to rich / powerful people. That’s when consequences happen.

Blacklisted? Or hushed away, he’s still getting a taxpayer paycheck and yet his office has been closed and he has not shown up for work. He also just bought a million dollar home in Florida, pretty good on a $174k salary.

I don't see how you could say something like a drag show is "grooming" when you really compare the two side by side since it's an activity people might attend once in a while at the most and where nobody is threatening or harassing you to attend and actively take part "or else", even as a young child (not that this matters to the religious/conservative crowd trying to deflect scrutiny from their own problems).

How much money did those parents have to hire those lawyers? Or did the lawyers just take a huge cut? Rich people were involved in bring down Alex Jones. That’s the rub: don’t fuck with people richer than you.

You would be suprised to know that I attended a party in 2003 in iran. The cops found the house and came inside to arest everyone. They took all bois and girls in the party. Took em to court next day and the judge said cuz there is a probability of sex between every non married couple in the party.he ordered for every one to face rape charges for men and prostitution charges for girls or geting randomly married to one another.
Absolute insanity. And they wonder why people have a problem with “their ways” this is horrible and the fact that the government supports it is disgusting but the victims family supporting it is just gross and despicable, all so they can say their daughter only “had sex” with her husband, refusing to acknowledge that rape is not sex and is not consensual 😡🤬🤯😤.

I try. This is the closest I could that speaks for women. . Then there's the "unless", the commentary, the whole tone of disrespect that decides over women's fate. I give up.

I definitely don't think we can honestly compare the tiny minority of fundamentalist religious nutjobs in the US to a country whos legal system, at national level, supports rapists by design.
Sad part is that he didn't trust his brain, the card he was reading from had it spelled incorrectly so he corrected the kid based on what the card said (that the school gave him). He said he knew it was wrong but he went with the card.
You’re describing DeSantis. Hope the rest of the country is able to stop it. This place has been a magnet for conservative retirees from the various northern states for too long, and it’ll take a generation to make Florida purple again. Honorable mention to Rick Scott before him for setting up the financial catastrophe that is unfolding here. 16 years of neocon governors, this is the result.

Exactly. His being gay was not what killed him inthe primary, and if dems avoided voting for him because they thought his homosexuality would scare off swing voters, they’d be wrong. The problem is he’s a brilliant bottle of hand sanitizer, and also a sellout.

Of course I did dumb shit when I was 14 and yes, sometimes I also suffered the consequences. Life doesn't discriminate between smart or dumb, being dumb is also no excuse in committing a crime and he absolutely was out there to commit a crime. You're just writing a scenario in your head that would make it more acceptable, that would trigger tolerance for his actions, but you don't know why he was there or what he was planning to do. Nor does it matter really. I feel bad for his mother, I don't feel pity or empathy for him.
The lenhs some of these people take it to us downright embarrassing and somehow they don’t see it They will literally go to war and fight each other over a name and a number on a jersey AND if that player announces they want a trade or go elsewhere THEN all of a sudden that “Fan” is sending death threats, Racist remarks, to that player WHILE WEARING THEIR NUMBER AND JERSEY (Looking at YOU 49er fans in particular) y’all sent death threats and racist Bs to Your own QB & WR1 in the off-season and now here you are praising them ALL WITHIN THE SAME YEAR! How is that NOT Mentally Unstable? Y’all bipolar & dumb AF.
Money diverted, maintenance not done. All the engineers who knew how to make critical parts nearing retirement and no way to quickly build new and better stuff except on paper.
Literally. A lot of Thermonuclear bombs use Tritium or some other light gas to aid the secondary fusion. That shit doesn’t stay in there forever. Think 3 week old helium balloon.

Exactly. They don't even need the nukes for this matter, they could annihilate Seoul and 10s of millions of people within an hour with just conventional payloads. The nukes are just the ace up the sleeve should the US decide they're gonna take over anyways (a dumb assumption, but one born out of paranoia, which the Kim regime lacks none).

Exactly. Given how much grift we now know has riddled their conventional military which has actually been in use regularly, what are the odds that the money allocated for maintaining nukes ended up in some commander's bank account? Especially given that nobody in their right mind expects nukes to ever actually be used.
…except the people who participated in Jan 6 are aligned with the party predominantly responsible for the gerrymandering, certainly making a concerted move with REDMAP, which makes it all the more bizarre.
No. Poland has in fact given Ukraine a lot of aid and continues to do so, and is a vital staging area for the flow of aid from other allies of Ukraine into Ukrainian territory.

For the European Union as an organisation to give Ukraine aid, all EU member states must agree. Hungary does not, so it cannot happen.

Still, I have to keep telling myself that I'm just dealing with hypocritical asses in some tribal circlejerk bubble who are willing to compromise on their values depending on who's saying it because they've reached the QAnon followers' bottomed level of consistency and emotional based zealotry, and hope that this isn't demonstrative of society overall, except perhaps the circles those asses are part of.

No? Nothing is stopping everyone else from deciding on a separate aid package that Hungary isn't part of, which is exactly what is happening right now. They just tried to do it as the EU first but Orban said no.
Many other countries have a similar problem, albeit not at that scale or for the same reasons. Shrinking native population, most people entering retirement, etc. Productive members of society only fall into the, roughly, 20-60 year old age bracket. Younger/older ones don't produce, they consume resources. So even jump starting a major birthing initiative could push things over the edge in the short term even quicker. The other countries in this predicament will usually import a solution, by encouraging immigration to fill in the gaps. But, China being China, that isn't necessarily going to work. At least for skilled labor.
There's possibly an alternative to this deterioration, and Japan might be the best place to find out (as their population peaked a bit over a decade ago), but it would need some careful management by various levels of government and some heavy duty social security structures. I'm not sure whether China scores highly on either of those measures, probably not. It could be a long period of internal instability ahead for China once the population decline really bites. Countries have been known to deal with internal difficulties by going to war with other countries.
So I made a slightly longer version that is a similar of this argument though I will more I am much more skeptical and critical Then I think many people, especially people who are non-native (which does include myself) would be. I know that this is a sensitive issue and I certainly don’t want to come across as having all the answers, but I do think for all of the people that go “well how can we object to this?” I think the problem is that there’s a lot that we still need to figure out. Also, as I mentioned in the comment, The thing that high, as a non-native person, looking and feel like is the elephant in the room with regard to native and indigenous politics in the US is that much of the way that tribes determine who can be a member really bothers me and seems pretty fundamentally opposed to much of the way that we think about race and nationality today. I’m certainly willing to give some leeway, But I do think it’s a problem when you can culturally raise your children as one thing and then suddenly they’re no longer eligible for membership in your tribe and the benefits that may come with that if you, say, marry someone outside of the tribe, or tribal membership requirements change as what happened with the disenrollment issues a while back. And I really think that compounds a lot of these issues around who gets to vote, whether it’s going to be based on region or if there’s some kind of special ballot or what not. I’m not gonna go completely into issues, but I guess if you’re curious, feel free to look through my other comment that I linked and bring up any objections or criticism any of y’all might have.

The most prominent one would be Bernie Sanders Medicare for All Bill. There are roughly 2 million regular middle class Americans working for the insurance companies that would be shuttered by Sanders bill and those workers are spread across all 50 states. On top of that, the annual cost of the program is roughly twice the total tax revenue that the government currently takes in. You don't make up that money by solely taxing the rich. Sanders entire list of suggestions for raising that additional revenue only added up to about half the total cost of the program and included a 5% income tax increase for all households. Vermont actually tried to implement a single payer system that was much less generous than Sanders plan and had to scrap it because they calculated that it would require an 11% increase for all households, which would strain the budgets pretty much any family with a mortgage. It was an idea to address a real problem, but designed in a way that would cause a lot of harm to a lot of people. But there are still plenty of people on the left who demand that specific solution to the very real problem of providing people with affordable healthcare.

Furthermore and more importantly, those shares are are, very, very, very, very likely, being used against you in convoluted derivative schemes (similar to 2008 Housing Derivative Meltdown; same deal, different financial instruments) andor actual non-delivery and ownership of shares made possible through aforementioned Wall Street lobbying and associated loopholes.

Fer fuck sake why has this taken so long? I first heard about the abhorant shark fin trade and how it was devastating shark populations at least 20 years ago.

It's cruel as well as wasteful: They catch the sharks in nets, cut off their fins and dump the still living sharks back into the water where they have no way to guide themselves so just sink to the bottom.
Ok fine here’s a better analogy for the idiots. I start a physical fight with someone, they throw a rock back at me. I duck, they hit someone else in the face breaking their nose/eye socket. Guess what? I’m not liable for their medical bills because I didn’t throw the fucking thing. Ukraine is liable for this, not Russia. It came from their air defense force. Whether it was an accident or not, doesn’t matter.
It means NATO actively destroying not just every missile and plane over Ukraine, but also every air defense system Russia has not just in Ukraine, but anywhere that can fire into Ukraine, or anywhere that might threaten your assets, meaning several hundred kilometers deep into Russian territory, along with the radar installations that send them data, the power substations that feed them, the airfields that host the fighters that are going to scramble in response to your attacks, and more.

Who tf said it was okay? I’m only saying that NATO doesn’t want to escalate to a nuclear war with Russia. If anything having NATO being aggressive is what the Russians want, the alliance has to be level headed.

Look up Office 39; it's a North Korean government agency that makes money for the regime through illicit activities (basically a state-run mafia) such as weapons and narcotics smuggling, selling counterfeit goods and currency, cybertheft, insurance fraud, human trafficking, etc.

If a peace treaty is signed with North Korea, then the core justification for the ROK-US Alliance (and the continued US troop presence) disappears soon afterward, which could lead to a formal termination of the alliance and US troop pullout.

Yeah. I understand your point, but they probably buy the radioactive material from Russia as they have huge deposits. Building the machinery may be difficult for them but let's say they have WW2 equipment. The majority of the equipment would be mechanical as back then semiconductors weren't around. So they could probably build it in north Korea. Some North Korean citizens also study abroad. Their leader Kim studied in Europe I believe. I'm sure some of their citizens probably study physics or nuclear physics at reasonable universities across the world to obtain the knowledge too.
For anyone that's confused, the magic is Russia. The magic interfered in 2016, and won him the election. The magic interferes with politics in a lot of sovereign states, to prop up guys like erdogan, marine la pen, trump. The magic also pushes a firehose of disinformation onto social media, incoherent conflicting messages made to sow doubt in democracy and conflict in society.
I’m not sure. Everyone was expecting Rudy to sling poo and most would recognize it as such. When the FBI director said it, it had credibility with a lot of moderates. It may have been just enough to tip the election. It’s hard to say.

The last time he got elected, without considering the illegal unethical and immoral nonsense, a million Americans died because he mismanaged the response to an outbreak of preventable illness. More than the lives lost in the sum of all foreign wars in US history. And he ballooned the deficit to over $2T/yr - more than the federal budget - as well.

Most developed nations are grappling with how to pay for the baby boom generation's need for geriatric care with populations that are plateauing. This is a big problem for Germany and Japan, and China is facing a huge crisis caused by the One Child policy. But those are populous countries constrained by natural resources. China instituted the One Child policy out of fear of Malthusian overpopulation. The one country in the world with plenty of space and natural resources for an expanding population is Russia, and they're throwing a generation of young men into the meat grinder. For every man killed or crippled, around ten emigrate. The conscripts come mostly from the poor, the talented and educated were the first to flee.
Exactly. This is also the reason why this genocide was rushed by all accounts. Not so long before war Ukraine signed deals with few companies that would help them gather those resources, since they themselves couldn't. Now that they could, putin suddenly became worried.
The problem is that critical thinking is a skill that has to be taught, because our natural instinct is to believe whatever fits our own worldview and reject anything that doesn't. That's human nature.
same morons that still support Trump today after finding out definitively that he tried to undermine democracy, defrauded a lot of people with his scam university, scammed and never paid a ton of contractors for his failed jersey casino project, stole top secret documents, and organized and orchestrated a failed coup. oh, and he was committing all kinds of tax fraud.

There's a growing body of evidence suggesting there's a potentially-causal link between extreme conservatism and possessing a larger/overactive amygdala (the portion of the brain responsible for fear/threat responses/flight-and-fight responses.) Add on top of that a couple million years of resource procurement and 'wealth' creation being a genuinely zero-sum game (something we're only just now really breaking away from) and, yeah.
"I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I've studied better than anybody, you know it's very expensive. They’re made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here almost none, but they’re manufactured tremendous if you’re into this, tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything.
You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right? Spewing. Whether it’s in ChAIna, Germany, it’s going into the air. It’s our air, their air, everything, right? So they make these things, and then they put em up, and if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters your house is worth 50 percent of the price. They're noisy, they kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go, take a look under a windmill someday you'll see more birds than you've seen ever in your life. You know in California they were killing the bald eagle, if you shoot a bald eagle they wanna put you in jail for 10 years. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true! And you know what? After a certain number they make you turn the windmill off, that's true by the way. But this is, they make you turn it off after you, and yet if you've killed one, they put you in jail, but that's OK. But why is it OK for these windmills to destroy the bird population, and that's what they're doing.

Meanwhile, it was American surveyors who charted the entire northern half of the island, American army engineers who installed radio towers and weather stations throughout the island, and represents the largest infrastructure project in the norther half of the island. Who owns the land? Some aged monarchy with nebulous connections to a failed viking settlement, or the people who actually built airbases, weather stations, and radio towers? (The real answer, of course, are the native peoples who got there first and whose culture is adapted to live in the harsh land without logistical support...but the USA probably is a distant second in legitimacy, and Denmark a doubtful, erroneous, outrageous third...).

Her criminal history is...special. She's been in trouble for shoplifting from Kohl's, stalking and harassing a judge over one of her cases, forgery, and tampering with evidence in a case. She tried to run for mayor before they told her she was ineligible to be on the ballot.
Holocaust denial is a central element in many of the more aggressive antisemitic conspiracy groups. They say its existence is proof of their globalist agenda.

Not sure if this is what you’re referring to but General Eisenhower was quoted as saying: “The things I saw beggar description…The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty, and bestiality were so overpowering…I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations to propaganda.”.

Thanks. I don’t recall the names of all the experts. I know architectural issues were important. The deniers would/will grab hold of some minor detail and try and blow it up into a major issue. E.g., one was whether the stacks the gas was dropped down were staggered or in a row. Another issue was about whether poison was detected in the material. (One study said no, but it was shown they tested an outer wall and poorly. Better studies found it as expected.).
It absolutely isn’t. In general, it is much harder to get CPS into a home and talking to kids and parents than this article makes it seem. I don’t think that the article is incorrect, I absolutely believe that families face these things, but it takes a lot to get CPS to actually do anything. I adopted my son from foster care I’m VT, and before he was taken from his home, 35 reports were made to DCF during kindergarten and 1st grade. Reports were made by school officials and his pediatrician. Once police found him, at age 5, walking a mile away from his house down a state highway because his parents were fighting and he was scared and left. He was gone for hours and no one noticed. His parents got in a fight and were throwing things at each other; a mug hit him in the face and cut him under the eye. It was at least a year after these events that CPS was able to remove him. Now I am a teacher in WA state, and have had to make several calls to CPS about things students disclose to me. Most of the time, the families refuse to be interviewed and so that’s it until another report is made, though probably the outcome will be the same. I made a report about safety concerns of a student this year because the student and a friend were talking about how the student’s dad was an alcoholic and an abuser. CPS went out but dad refused to talk. Later in the year they removed her from the home because he got drunk and punched her in the head so hard she got a concussion, and she was only removed from the home because he was in jail.

These border guards have to realize that they are no longer border guards which would be deployed to defend the border from outside aggression. These guys are now prison guards.
Haha another commenter just notified me of that function Wasn't aware, but that's a super rad aspect I'll certainly make use of I'm a little handy in Spanish, and Italian seemed to be a bit easier to learn bc of it's similarity, but I peered into some starting Germanic and BaltoSlavic languages and noped right the fuck out until I can dedicate some more time and attention. I have a better learning base for Romantic languages currently. Lots of opportunity to learn more moving forward, ik just a young US guy, and play with the idea of moving out of the US, but working as a nurse in hospitals, I would need to be quite capable if I wanted to be an proficient nurse. Hard to comfort people when you can't communicate well on a day to day basis.

Every country has an internal security apparatus. The US has the FBI, the UK has MI-5, France has the DGSI, etc. The fact that the KGB has a successor isn't the problem.

Exactly. From everything I've seen, Russians that move to other countries do so only so they can live there as Russians in another country. Still waving the flag, still getting defensive over all the horrible things Russia is doing.

Absolutely. All you have to do is bring back slavery turn women into the property of their fathers or husbands, lower the age of consent to 12 and publicly execute their political rivals. They'd be happy as clams.

Exactly. They’re like children who want to be allowed to eat all the candy they want and still be healthy. Sometimes you gotta eat your spinach. That’s life. These people will never think they’ve been given enough or kow towed enough. They need to be ignored until they freaking stop riding the “poor me” train.

Exactly. I'm telling you that right lean is real here. That is exactly why the Republicans targeted successfully the Latin American population here for votes. Despite being immigrants they voted for Republican politicians more in this massive swing state than not.

From the article it seems that the family was shot at, starved, lost everything and almost died as the Russians sieged and took the city. But they survived. Now the mother works in the occupant "administration" of the territory and this gives the family an income and some security for now. A chance to live.
Whether you are a Catholic priest in the US who thinks you are saving the souls of the kidnapped native children, or you are an instructor of Hitler Youth and you think you are protecting these children against perceived enemies, or a guy taking hundreds of children from a warzone and depositing them to the people bombing them you are still committing genocide.

That is fair. There’s probably a lot of people who believe the propaganda and that they are really “helping” these Ukrainian kids, who wouldn’t have needed the help to begin with if Russia hadn’t bombed their towns and families.

This will be an unpopular opinion, but I’m sure that there are Russians who don’t approve of the war, so they spend their time helping as much as they can. Maybe this yuri guy is one of those people.
If people had any idea how much money, time, and effort was spent to win that margin it would blow their minds. It took a 24/7 anti-Democrat propaganda network to pull it off, there are whole books written about the people Hillary Clinton has personally killed, the Russians had to hack her emails and Wikileaks had to misrepresent them to the public, if Donald Trump hadn't been a (shamefully popular) reality TV show start it might have made all the difference, like, it took a fuck ton of work to bring Clinton down, and even then they were 0.057% away from it all falling apart.
Fair enough. Dems did lose support overall though with women compared to last election. I misread the graph. But yes, you did point out the weakness of my argument.

Yeah, neither did anybody else for that matter, the mainstream media dedicated more air time to negative stories about Clinton than any other candidate, they dedicated less air time to covering her policy than any other candidate, she had to carry around all the nonsense baggage from the primary about her nomination being "rigged" and how "as a neoliberal capitalist" she was as much "a part of the problem" as the Republicans, and then the cherry on top was James Comey making the historically unprecedented choice to hold a public press conference to discuss an on going FBI investigation about Clinton the week before the election.
Pretty much. Everyone wants to blame corporations and expects them to fix everything but nobody seems to acknowledge that corporations make things because people want the things they make . If we stopped buying their stuff they wouldn't make it, nobody is going to invest time and resources into something nobody wants. Why would Nike, for example, stop using slave labor and voluntarily increase their prices allowing someone else to swoop in and use slave labor because Americans have proven they will buy those products. So yeah in this example Nike would have a better public image but the new company would just take it's place and the problem continues, the only thing this would accomplish is lowering Nikes profits and transferring them to someone else who's willing to be unethical. As long as society accepts unethical behavior why would a company put itself at a disadvantage in the marketplace and suddenly adopt ethics?
Exactly. Every normal person could go completely off-grid with solar panels and windmills and electric vehicles, and oil and gas companies would still run a profit selling to other industries. Only way to avoid it is to never use any manufactured goods and live like a caveman.
Has the US ever exerted its authority over the Prime Minister or similar of a ruling authoritarian regime for a lawsuit, civil or criminal, for a crime that happened in their own jurisdiction?
You've lost me. I gave you a solid example in the last comment. If you're still not convinced the president has the power to not enforce a US law, then that's on you. Doesn't make it any less of a fact.

Can you show me any example where the President unilaterally decided to extend such a non-presidential power into not just another country, but into the consulate of another country within yet another country?

Examples of a US President picking and choosing which federal laws to enforce within the US, where there's some actual notion of federal or executive jurisdiction, don't really apply well to an entirely different country.

Missing the point here guy. Used to be legal to beat your wife in the US, but didn't make it right. The fact that they are hiding behind legalese without making a stand against this extreme barbarism is why this feels icky.

Yes. If you don’t have standing the case in its entirety is tossed. The US court system does not do advisory opinions, if you don’t have damages (or the potential for damages as the case may be especially in declaratory judgment actions) you can’t bring suit.

That's actually fairly reasonable. You're restricting your ability to pay early in exchange for a specific type of (likely lower interest) loans for three years. It's time limited, not randomly attached, and something to opt into in exchange for something else. Additionally the early prepayment fee isn't huge. Likely you'd want to wait the three years instead of eating the fee, but if you had to do it, it wasn't a deal killer.
Ha, you know the amount of times indian establishment regardless of their political ideology have been betrayed by Pakistan is astounding. First in 1999, the hindu nationalist BJP led NDA government started peace negotiations as lahore declaration, they started a bus route from India to Pakistan and PM vihari was among the first passenger and they signed the lahore declaration at the same time thousands of Pakistani troops were crossing over the border into india in himlayan mountains resulting in kargil war.
I am really an outsider so don't get mad. I think it is an empty statement because Pakistan is so fragmented and even under Taliban attack in some places. However,It is a remarkable statement but too late to prevent China from further fragmenting it and getting whatever raw mineral wealth it may have. If I were in India I might worry about having to negotiate with Mr. Xi Jinping about all things Pakistan. Khan will be the PM.

Kashmir's geopolitical position is invaluable. Pakistan Occupied Kashmir is what connects them to China, and the route China wants to use in the long term to circumvent the Indian Ocean and South China Sea choke points. If by same miracle India gains back those territories, it will connect them to Central Asia and open up all the historical land based trade routes to the Stans.
It was the same with Ukraine before Russia annexed Crimea, after that happened there was overwhelming support for joining NATO.
Not sure what part of this is so complicated for people to grasp - Russia's annexation of Crimea made Ukraine want to join NATO again, and dramatically increased public support for NATO in Ukraine.

LOL nice way to handwave away the fact that Ukraine re-started the process to join Nato after Russia attacked - and the claim he couldn't have been elected if Ukraine started to join NATO in 2008 is just straight up nonsense.

And FYI - Ukraine was blocked from joining NATO after the Bucharest meeting, withdrew their application and the majority of Ukrainians did not want to join. It did not change anything.

I even can bet with you that after Ukraine win this war, and obviously ask NATO about joining alliance, and i think I don't need to explain why NATO needs Ukraine as participant of alliance, NATO leaders will softly refuse to Ukraine, saying bullshit like "yeah, doors are always open, Ukraine deserve it, but its looooong process, we are not suuuuure, we need to start negotiaaations, consultaaaaations and maybe in 30 years or more, we will find out, Ukraine will get a chance to not join NATO, but become a XXL VIP ultra best NATO partner, because you know put any stupid reason here" - or simply will start singing the same song that Ukraine been listening for many years from NATO.

Link please. I did see an article on this about a month or so back. From what I understood this was a local bank and was not a systemic risk to their system. Nothing like the a Lehmann's event or the like.

As i said, NATO is military defence alliance and question about joining or not joining is based on national security and defence interests, decisions in which can be taken only by government with military consultations and have nothing to do with public opinion at all. Its not fucking political alliance, which would need public opinion for joining or not joining it. Ukrainian government and military were ready to join NATO in 2008 and had all decisions needed for it already on paper - only vote of parliament were needed to implement it in law, and parliament already was supporting it. Everyone knew that russia will attack Ukraine next after Georgia, no-one knows when it happen, but it was obvious it will happen. It was only Merkel's decision to not allow us to join NATO.

Public opinion have nothing to do with joining to NATO at all. Literally everyone in country can oppose it, but if parliament vote for joining and NATO agree that country can join NATO, all you need is only your president sign on document about joining. All this referendums about joining NATO is only consultative and can't change decision of government about joining or not joining NATO.
That’s… not how this works? Until a new law specifically says that SCOTUS has a different number of seats, SCOTUS has 9 seats because this is the most recent law addressing it. Congress sets the size of every federal court through law, and it only changes if Congress passes a new law specifically changing the size of that court. Laws don’t lapse just because.
The bonus is, it's super easy to implement as all it requires is a simple majority to establish a new Apportionment Act and then our representative democracy might actually start representing the people again instead of primarily serving large corporate interest.

Hmmmmmmmmmm. Yeah you may be right. I can see the argument that the law has been repealed by the introduction of later acts which did not contain the hard limit on seats, but there's also a strong argument that this law continues to control.
The thing with the Challengers vs the T-72s is more about logistics, the reason it's taken so long to get western tanks supplied is that we have to set up a logistical train and make sure the manufacturers (who are private companies) are ready to supply parts. We don't have that problem with T-72s because a bunch of the closest NATO nations are ex Warsaw Pact and can supply and even manufacture parts for the Ukrainians and are themselves looking to modernize on US and German equipment which is more modern and integrated into NATO logistics anyway.
Lol have you? Do you? Forgive my bluntness, but you don't seem to have a fucking clue, given your claims earlier that "99% of Sahrawi consider themselves Moroccan" and that Sahrawi people in Laayoune are "under no oppression", when I just showed you video of Sahrawi in Western Sahara, including Laayoune itself, literally celebrating Morocco's defeat and getting brutalized for it.

Food. Ukrainian grain feeds around 200 million people around the world, majority in Africa, exports 10% of world's needs. 2 years ago Morocco , I don't think it changes since then. Tunisia also buys Ukrainian grain and its like 60-80% of all grain imported in Tunisia. I have friend in Tunisia and he said when Ukraine stopped export by obvious reasons, there simply was no flour in Tunisia and no bread at all.

they're basically using him as a battering ram to push the country further right...there have been a number of republicans who have realigned themselves with dems, but the long haul GOPers put up with it because it lets them be more crazy cuz "at least they aren't Trump"...i had a FOX news watching family member tell me he wouldn't vote for Trump again, but would hope someone more reasonable "like Tom Cotton" gets the nod...like holy shit if Tom Cotton is a mark of reason...we're fucked.
Liberals. It doesn’t matter if it’s true and no amount of evidence will convince them. The flowers of years of conservative dehumanization of the left are blooming. They don’t see it as violence when it is committed against those they have been instructed to hate.

Neural networks are created through evolution. To create a neural network you first design a tester basicly to see how good your algorithm is. Than you go on and randomly create 100s if not thousends of programs with the hardware available those are tested. let's say the best 5 than go on and are replicated again a fe thousend copy all with very slight adjustments all made randomly ofc. This goes on and on and on till the best version solves the test program to an adequate lvl. We now know the alogrythm works but since in the creation of said algorithm no human actully designed anything besides the test nobody know how the neural network solves the problems only that it does. This is why you can find that some AI is "racist" not because the creator was racist but because for randmess to solve the test the easiest way was to be "racist" the creator just didn't design the test well enouth.

Probably the space he rented to Celebrity Apprentice was same space he had loaned to Jeffry Epstein for their "Model parties." Notice that Epstein got the space for free. (Although photos and testimony about those parties indicate Trump was paid off in other ways by Epstein. Call it barter.).
Although obstruction of justice is typically discussed in the context of criminal contempt, the concept informs the rules of law—both substantive and procedural—that have been devised to protect the courts and litigants (and therefore the public) from abusive litigation tactics. If use of an abusive tactic is deliberate and actually impedes the orderly litigation of the case, to-wit: obstructs justice, the perpetrator could be cited for criminal contempt.

The likelihood is just so so so low. We’re not just talking about the vastness of space, but also time. The amount of time it takes for a species to evolve to the level it would need to be, would be at least as long as human history, if not millions of years longer. This other species would have to evolve to the right level at exactly the right time we humans happen to be here on Earth, in just the last couple hundred thousand years, compared to the billions of years on the time scale of the universe. Even if there’s many many alien species out there on other planets… they’re probably either still just in the bacteria stage, or they died out millions of years ago after reaching the pinnacle of their civilization. The sliver of time that a species would be likely to be able to be at the right level of development to become a space-faring species… is SO incredibly unlikely to line up with the time that you and I are alive. It’s incredibly unlikely to line up with the time that humans exist. We’ve only been here a couple hundred thousand years, we’ll probably only be here for like another couple hundred thousand at most, and even if we do develop light speed travel, we’d still only be able to reach the one nearest galaxy in about 100,000 years.
Oh no. Remember how that went in the Star Trek movie? If they do their regular check and find out both of the protected species are in trouble...we're looking at some pretty hefty fines at best.

Advancement of technology can actually often lead to increased emotional/moral detachment. Think about how drone technology removed the pilots from the personal experience, and made it easier to pull the trigger because it feels like a video game. Think about how advancement of the nuclear bomb made it easier to kill mass amounts of people.

It wasn't. There was a a few years later that did a deep dive on the allegations and what happened after, and it brought up a number of inconsistencies in her story. Franken did apologize for the picture in which he pretended like he was going to grab her breasts through a flak jacket, and she read it on air and said she accepted his apology, but as far as I can tell she never withdrew or modified her allegation.
>For the first time in 100 years, it took more than one vote for the House to elect a new Speaker. The tension between Republican members was apparent on the House floor this week, as they slowly gathered enough votes to get Kevin McCarthy across the line. But the dynamic in the House this week does not bode well for the controlling party. “It’s gonna be a mess,” says former Republican congressman and former governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford. “Why anybody would want to be speaker right now with this thin of a majority, I don’t know.” Sanford is a former member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, but he recognizes that it’s far different from what it used to be. “The idea of ‘far-right’ back then is a long way from ‘far-right’ right now,” Sanford tells Ali Velshi. “It has metastasized in sort of a cancerous form during the Trump era into something that I don’t quite recognize.”.

to help you out though, it isnt rigged for the democrats either..here is a hint, both the DEMs and GOP contain members of one certain demographic the whole system is set up to benefit. I am not sure how much more obvious it needs to be.

It definitely wasn't patriotism. So many Republicans were publicly appalled at the actions of Trump and were all "enough is enough" on tv but the second they realized there was zero backlash from the base and they started getting hassled in public they came right back home to daddy Trump.
I read an article several years ago about this. At first, the article read as if the downward slide of the public school system was caused by forced integration. Allowing minorities into white only schools was the problem. I was obviously thinking WTF am I even reading. But then the writer got to the meat of the issue, and explained that the real reason was because conservatives decided to punish the public school system relentlessly over decades, for forcing them to allow integration. It was a very intelligently written piece, and I wish I could find it and link it, but unfortunately Google isn’t helping me.
Serious question. Why didn't he clean house when he took office? I imagine it's a bit of a logistical nightmare to do that and find qualified candidates, but is that not better than knowing some people who's whole job is to protect you, aren't trustworthy?

It's 0. None of those people have the balls to try that. None of them want to spend the rest of their lives in prison.

I vividly remember one very clear time my dad stating that if his son brought home another boy that boy would be lucky to leave alive. It's why my adolescence was mostly just fear. I really didn't get it back then, and I simply believed it to be literally true. (I tend to take things literal.).
And define "natural" - because you and I and everyone we know, less a few scattered tribes in the Amazon and the Sentinel Islands are surrounded by "unnatural" societies, social constructs, and technologies that make life easier, and even _they_ constitute as tool users.

As a dad... I can't fathom how parents could treat their child like that. Literally the single most important thing to me is giving my son a happy life.

She tends to hate what the church tells her it's OK hate, like lots of 'church people' do. They hate Muslims too, but that doesn't mean they're secretly Muslim.
Well my husband's family moved to Queens in the 80's so I don't know what impact that would have had, maybe a lot, maybe very little. But even then, we lean left in the sense of thinking people shouldn't hate each other because of their race, and maybe giving all the monetary gains made in the last 60 years to a small group of cutthroat billionaires was a pretty bad idea, and that universal healthcare would be better for everyone and save a lot of money, but that's still a far cry from literal communism.
."Biden received 92% of the Black vote, statistically indistinguishable from Hillary Clinton’s 91% in 2016. His support among Black women was never in doubt, but President Trump’s alleged appeal to Black men turned out to be illusory. (His share of the Black male vote fell from 14% in 2016 to 12% in 2020 while Biden raised the Democrats’ share from 81% to 87%.) African Americans confirmed their status as a unique group of voters for whom the contemporary Republican Party holds no discernible appeal.".
He might be the part of indian right. And you think right is all about slaughtering Muslims, right??
Russia is a terrorist and fascist country and should be treated as such (the government mostly) and though ussr helped India it hurt and infringed autonomous countries that bordered it, did similar things that nazis did. And now these days they’re trying to do the same, to bring back the ussr and cause terror to other countries. Ukraine was and is an autonomous country and doesn’t belong to Russia and the countries that join NATO joins it out of their own free will. But whatever believe the brainwashing instead I don’t care, truth is truth so no matter how many times you’ll spew lies a lie won’t become the truth.

Also people have been brainwashed to believe everything the government tells them even when it’s not true. There are some cultural racism there too, the whitewashing and no need to lie and pretend that that doesn’t exist, when there is plenty of data about it. And so is the red light district also a thing. Rape culture although masked still exits there. Am I trying to say that India is a bad place and that they’re bad people? No, that would be the same black and white thinking just like about Muslims.
Simple. USM Athletics Foundation are top donors to Phil Bryant and later Tate Reeve's campaign. Follow the money. Favre says build me a new stadium. USM says how are we gonna pay for it. Favre calls in some favors from his buddy Phil, Phil contacts Nancy New and said redirect me some TANF funds and she does it. And now that both Phil and Brett are taking heat they asked their friend Tate to kill the investigation. Tate fires the attorney who sent subpoenas to the USM Athletic Foundation. I bet if you could read Tate's text messages there'd be all the proof you need that he was asked to run interference for the investigation by both Brett and Phil.

Hi nosotros_road_sodium. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
Why are you confident Trump would lose in the general election? He garnered the second most votes in history last time. With the Supreme Court's dismantling of the voting rights act, states like Georgia, that Biden won, could very easily wind up going for the Republican nominee just because of how many black would-be voters are unable to cast their ballots. And historically, the Presidential election has usually been a referendum on the state of the economy, if the economy is doing much below average or much above average; I certainly don't feel confident that the average American is going to think the economy is doing well in 21 months (heck, I'm not even sure if it's going to be debatable-- there is a non-trivial chance that the economy will be in a dark place by then).
Then get punched in the fucking face. There's no way around it if a bully's threatening to punch you unless he can corrupt your crew into doing his (and that's being used loosely here) bidding. You either punch the bully or say no, let the bully punch you and let the aftermath play out.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
No. Republicans hurt republicans. Conservative nationalists hurt republicans. The supreme court hurt republicans. The money pumped into the economy and never removed hurt republicans. Gas companies that are turning record profits hurt republicans. Abortion rights hurt republicans. Trump coming in at the end only hurt them because they have someone to blame and the countries short term memory has been obliterated. Republicans keep eroding our rights for either profit or their religion. Nothing else and people are sick of it. Only the loyalists are left for the republicans and it’s seems enough of them turned out to vote. The next battle begins now because in 2 years, it’s gonna be an all out war for presidency. The only one left to blame after that is ourselves for letting this mess continue.

If someone they consider a "man in a dress" is legally classified as an "adult performer" when all they're doing is reading Mary Poppins to kids in a library while dressed as the titular character, what exactly does that mean for the person whom they consider a "man in a dress" who is just trying to go to her job as a 5th grade Music teacher? Or hell, just trying to go to the grocery store?

This guy is making Trump look good. I said I would never vote for Trump, but if I only had 2 choices, sadly I think I'd vote Trump. Desantis is literally following the Fascist playbook. To me, Trump does just to get votes but is not as dangerous as Desantis, (he's more intelligent than Trump, hence capable of more devious acts) if you can believe that. A man who tried to overthrow the government in my mind is less dangerous than Florida's Mussolini.
It's slightly more complex. Sometimes a leader can be chosen purely by MPs of their party (the people sitting in parliament) whereby they must get a certain amount of backing before they can be included on the ballot. Then this can either go through several rounds of elimination before the MPs select a candidate or it can go to the public membership.
When they put it to the party membership (the general public that pay a small fee to support the party) there will be debates and the party membership get to vote. There was an a disproportionate amount of coverage for this when Boris Johnson resigned. It was prime time TV and front page news coverage for weeks but less than 200,000 people, or 0.25% of the country, could vote.

But Liz...seriously? You're saying that "a lack of political support and opposition from the economic establishment" isn't your fault? You're basically admitting you tried to force through unpopular policies that were contradicting established economic knowledge...and suggesting that failure to do so is a bad thing. Truss is right about one thing: if the system was functioning better, the UK would have much more effective leadership, which would have meant she never would have come to power in the first place.

I mean, yes, the UK is having some serious structural issues right now and that absolutely has affected the quality of the political leaders in the country. A lot of this comes back to Brexit creating a bit of a Gordian Knot situation which resulted in politicians being tasked with the impossible...which of course they failed to solve. Theresa May is probably the best example of this.
An interesting detail not mentioned there is that in the pov video you can see one of the Russians on the ground looking back at his armed comrade, knowing what’s about to happen. In the drone footage of the aftermath you can see that same dude managed to run a few steps before being gunned down. To me that makes it very clear it wasn’t an execution but a return fire that was over in mere seconds.
Stop regurgitating propaganda then. This incident was both miniscule compared to the other crimes of Russia and was caused by Russia. You don't know what you are talking about and you are supporting Kremlin propaganda (or you're a Russia troll).

However...it wasn't. A russian soldier opened fire on the ukrainians, turning the surrender to a combat situation which got all the russians killed.

One of the russians hid around a corner with a gun, then popped out and shot the ukrainians. Which meant that this was not a surrender anymore but a combat situation. Which unfortunately got ukrainians wounded and all the russians killed.

\5 ukrainians are letting 11 russians surrender. A machine gunner has his gun one the ground, lined up to hit all the russians on the floor if anyone tries to harm the ukrainians. Then one russian starts shooting at the ukrainians at which point they obviously return fire. The machine gunner alone probably killed all those on the floor in the first second. And we see bullet holes consistent with them being shot from the machine gunner, not from the back.

The machine gunner alone could've easily killed all of them in seconds. He's on the floor, with \6 russians already in his line of sight. He doesn't have great situational awareness from the floor and he's ready to shoot any second if any russian tries something fishy (this is important, he's deliberately pointing exactly at them already!). Then he's shot at. To me it's very reasonable that he immediately pulls the trigger (consistent with the audio from the video), then moves his gun to target the attacker, whilst still pulling the trigger (consistent with the bullet holes on the wall behind the russians). That motion would've moved his line of fire over every last russian.
For better or for worse I always admired that people from places like Texas, Georgia, and Utah always gloated about how awesome their states were and how much better they were than everywhere else (especially policy wise / people wise). Liberals would talk about how Salt Lake City and Austin and Atlanta are just as liberal as anywhere else and "you'd be surprised" and not talk about the negative affects of conservative policy at the state level while conservatives always gloated about how successful and great the states were because they weren't "ruined by democrats". Like Sandy from SpongeBob was the least proud Texan I've ever encountered and had the calmest reaction of anyone (liberal or conservative) from Texas to any outsider criticizing Texas.
Theoretically both are possible. You can get a lot done in two years when you have a majority in the entire state legislature.

It's generally financial bad advice to have 56 billion dollars in one basket. In March, Elon This allows him to both liquidate Tesla stock and do a pump and dump with twitter. He bought 73.5 million shares at a price between $33 and $38 per share, which comes to 2.4b-2.8b. He broke the news of buying those shares on April 4th and the price went up to $51 per share at the peak, or 3.8b. He just make a billion dollars in a couple weeks by having a high profile and that's it. A couple guys who have influence have made similar plays recently, ask r/wallstreetbets. He was following this easy social media trend to make $71 million dollars a day for 14 days of minor effort. And he's before, , and been reprimanded . I guarantee he was bragging to a couple people about his free billion dollars.

We Need accountability from the administration first before holding individual airlines accountable. This is mostly their fault for shitty airline labor negotiations in 2021 followed up by prolonged travel restrictions that were only recently lifted back in august resulted in a labor shortage. And with transportation industry Covid mandates and policies new pilots can’t get their required flight hours creating an even larger labor shortage. It’s not just southwest doing this to passengers spirit airlines and frontier airlines have been doing this shit since September 2021 and the Biden administration has done nothing with those airlines except let them go bankrupt. None of these passengers will get refunds or new flights unless they have travel insurance. Everyone is just shit out of luck. Fortunately I am able to have my credit card company do charge backs every time the airlines do this shit to me. so far ive been lucky and couple thousand dollars have been charged back for the airlines shitty service across the board. TLDR: I’m blaming the government for this. Fly American or delta if you don’t want this shit to happen to you.

I don’t see how they get to 60 votes to pull that off in the Senate. Though it’s not outside the realm of possibility that they blow up the filibuster if they get a simple majority and try to push through but they’d have to get both houses of Congress and the Presidency because they definitely won’t get a veto proof majority. We’re more likely looking at government spinning its wheels as one chamber or another or the Presidency saves us. Unless they fully take over the federal government in which case we are fucked in so many ways if they remove the filibuster and we can add the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to the mountain of legislation they will pass to take us back to the 19th century.
Yep. It's why they're fighting so hard to rollback state's voting rights. And then when people/organizations sue, what's this? It's all the conservative, shill judges they've installed in federal courts and on SCOTUS. They're only going to bend and break the rules more and more as time goes on in order to try to remain relevant and in power.

Lol. What about donations to the seven democratic objectors in 2017? McGovern, Raskin, Jayapal, Grijalva, Jackson Lee, Lee, Waters all objected to the results in nine states. It’s literally part of the democratic process.
I won't object if a woman seeks an abortion because she was raped or a physician identifies some sort of severe medical problem in the pregnancy. What I do object to is when abortion is applied outside of that sphere, when people decide that the best way to prevent a child from being born into poverty is not welfare and charity but to prevent the child from being born at all, when a mother decides that a disability is enough to invalidate the life of the unborn, or when they decide a foetus, a potential human life, is disposable because they just don't feel like raising a kid.
Ty. Wasn’t it fine before? I mean, why is it better at 16 weeks rather than 10? Anyone would be able to tell they’re pregnant after 2 months, am I missing something?

There's personal freedom and then there's deciding to enable decision-making that ultimately strips other people of agency and devalues human life but I guess human life or even basic morality doesn't matter to someone who openly desires mass population reduction on a scale that would make Pol Pot look like a humanitarian by comparison. What good is your delusional supposed utopia of space travel if a staggering amount of humanity will never see it?
In the grand scheme of things, however, it could be a net positive for the world (Western, especially). A semi-demilitarised Russia can attempt another invasion again within a decade. One which has sacrificed nearly all of its arsenal and a big chunk of its young population will have a harder time ever rebounding to its prewar level of power. Thus, another two years of war might permanently remove Russia as a significant geopolitical player altogether.
Part of the problem is maintenance. The US military spends a lot on pulling stored tanks out and making sure their still in working order. Russia more than likely hasn't. Instead of spending the money someone probably stole it for themselves. Remember rubber seals dry. Parts start to rust and leak.

We (as in NATO+EU+other allies) have literally more than a order of magnitude more military equipment and industrial capability than russia. We should've been over-supplying Ukraine 10:1. It's only a question of will, which sadly seems to be lacking.

Corporations still cannot donate to political campaigns. The law SCOTUS overturned in Citizens United didn't deal with political donations, and your quotes show that. "Independent expenditures" aren't campaign contributions. By law, they can't have any connection to campaigns (whether that law is effectively enforced is another matter, but that's not the fault of CU). They are expenditures on speech made independently of a campaign. If I buy some paint and do a mural on the side of my house that reads "Mitch McConnell blows goats", that's an independent expenditure. If I give money to Mitch McConnell's opponent in a race, that's a donation.

The story is kinda murky. Some rumors claiming his family was threatened in Russia. Others claiming it's because he was sent to infiltrate the Freedom for Russia Legion. Others claiming it's simply that Ukraine couldn't trust someone who was sentenced for murder for so long a sentence. Others saying that it's because the number of PoWs Wagner was willing to trade for him was too enticing. Etc.
Is the blademissile similarly physically gruesome? Sure, but "killing your own troops to terrorize any others that don't want to fight" is horrific and "assassinating an enemy leader, and going out of your way to use a blade missile that presumably has lower odds of success than a bomb but will minimize civilian casualties" is relatively humane as far as war things go.

So what? The Ukrainian ends up getting mistreated and possibly tortured as a POW while a person, who may or may not be totally honest, and who is a convicted criminal for serious crimes is relatively free.

QUICK! How much would the range of himars rockets increase if the warhead was replaced with bottles of vodka with parachutes?
roughly 1400 years. Prior to that, Persia was predominantly Zoroastrian followed by many other local and imported religions like Bahai'i, Judiasm, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and even Sikhism.
We will do nothing. The Iranian government will unleash their death squads. They will crush these people.

Andrew Tate thought Muslim leadership was better, I'm sure, because of its tendency to brutally oppress women, marry them off to rapists at very young ages, forbid their education, and most of all, allow mediocre men like him to occupy positions of complete physical, sexual and intellectual dominance in the home and pretend they're actually worth respecting.

I don't know. The human race is never going to advance as long as petty authoritarians are busy brainwashing populations and making them think it's ok or necessary to kill one another. Spending all of their resources on weapons or weapons research.

Good absolutely. But not one single US soldier and not one single US dollar. We came out of Afghanistan in August 2021. We overthrew the Taliban to replace the government with the Taliban on our way out.
ugh, I know we're joking but this is all based on real shit. Like "America's Mayor" from 9/11 really stood out there and ranted about election fraud without evidence but with spray-on hair color dripping down his head. And it's very likely he rented a space at a 4 Seasons feed and seed when he meant to do it at a 4 Seasons hotel. And people REALLY trust that guy when he says "Hunter Biden's laptop has all this crazy stuff on it but you can't see it and even though the FBI looked at it and said it wasn't there, it really is, just trust me.".
Understandable, but disappointing because no one is better equipped to exploit the tiny, chaotic Republican majority and, after all, Pelosi's first legislative accomplishment as Leader was sinking Bush's Social Security plan while in the minority in the House, where a simple majority rules.

Hold the fuck up! You mean to tell me that people prior to WWII did not get to enjoy the delicious delicacy of Chocolate Chip Cookies? No wonder we ended up this way.

This sentiment seems to be shared a lot, this is just kinda simple minded though. Humans weren't meant to kill other humans like that. One of the things the nazis learned in the genocide department when it comes to the humans dishing it out, and why it's much more effective to use chemicals to execute mass amounts of people: killing someone takes a toll on anyone, it's easy to do when you think you could die, but when you have plenty of time to sit there and contemplate your options, and also the person you're killing, it's horribly detrimental to your mental state which you probably want to protect given they are your soldiers and heavily armed.
True. The only way seems to be the Iranians, seeing the only way out is to take down the evil regime, since they were gonna die anyway, takes up arms. The US would have interest in the rebellion weakening Iran, so maybe they'll sell the rebels weapons, but that's about it. The West simply will sleep like they always do when brown people get slaughtered.
Might not be worth it to replace your hot plate mid-remodel, but when it comes to single-burner 120v portables, the NuWave units which let you specify the temperature make dealing with oil a lot easier. Results in fantastically consistent frying.
And you can't light them in the event of an outage. I live in Texas. I insisted on a gas stove instead of electric because we get hurricanes- and no, the pressure in the pipes doesn't last forever when there's no electricitt to run the pumps to keep it up, but it's better than an electric stove that is functionally kaput as soon as you lose power.

Yes. You get pretty much instant heat from the induction stoves too, and temperature control is reproducible across different pots and pans in a way that's a lot tougher with gas stoves.

I prefer the experience on the newer induction stoves to gas. You get really good temperature control for frying, rapid heat adjustments, and the ability to get your pot up to temperature incredibly quickly. It's just a better experience, even when you don't include not having to breathe the fumes.
I mean I'm pretty sure I have a wider field of view looking out through the windshield and windows than looking through a backup camera or using the mirrors as well as having less blind spots. Like if someone was walking along the cars in the spaces next to mine I feel like I'd definitely see them earlier as I'm pulling out if I had previously backed in because I would be able to lean forwards and peak around the cars to my left and right. However, there are cases where it makes more sense to pull in such as if a parking lot has angled parking spots or if theres an open spot behind the one you're pulling into so that you can just pull into that other spot and be setup to just pull out later.
Happy cake day. In some states without front plates, it’s a no no because it’s harder for law enforcement and parking folks to keep tabs on ya. That said, backing into a spot reduces your odds of a parking lot collision substantially cause so many people get hit back out.

It's literally easier. The turning wheels are at the front of the car, so reversing into the space gives you the ability to get a much tighter angle, and get into the space.
It's because fox news doesn't sell truth or lies, they sell an experience. An identity. Watching it makes you a better American. Ever try to disprove something said on FN to a fan of it? It won't do you any good because it's not about that. It has nothing to do with politics either, Republicans don't actually care about any of the issues. Fuck they don't actually even know any issues, they think trans people using the wrong bathroom is an issue. I live in Ohio and constantly hear about illegal immigration from people who have never even seen an illegal immigrant. There was never going to be a border wall because it was impossible to build in the first place. Trump never had any intention of building a wall, in fact he desperately needed someone to stop him from doing it for it to work at all. That's why barely anything got built despite him actually having had the power to build it. Im worried abpur what he actually did while we were busy worrying about that wall nonsense.

Government employees’ wages come from taxpayers. Taxpayers are people that dedicate large portions of their time to making money to survive with the understanding that the portion of their wages taken for purposes of taxation will be dedicated to services designed to protect, enhance and advance their interests.
You used a ton of words to say absolutely nothing. It's a job, many of those positions you can do from home. Many have been doing it from home for the last 2.5 years without issue.

Public service is a sector of employment with different connotations than the private sector that comes with different expectations in a system of governance that’s designed to reinforce rights that required two world wars, a failed international coalition dedicated to reinforcing peace that led to the second of those world wars which resulted in the codification of the basis of the system we are apart of in modern times.

Yes I very much do. Most of my decisions influence Citizens in a very private very servere manner. The law leaves space for human judgement in both directions. Harsher or lenient depending on the human element.

Joe Biden won the Democratic Party's nomination in large part--if not entirely--because African American voters rejected "Defund the Police" and other more progressive movements that they correctly identified as mostly driven by young white people who value being seen as an "ally" to the black community more than they value the practicality of achievable policies that will lead to better governance, policing, and service to historically underserved, marginalized, and oppressed communities.

Yeah no. The future of politics is fair representation for the millions of progressives who are currently outvoted by empty land. DC and PR statehood. Abolish the senate and uncap the house and institute an age limit of 70. That’s the future.

About 10 years ago I worked at a screen printing shop in a pretty small “city” in southern Indiana. I used my personal vehicle to deliver a couple boxes of shirts to the boys and girls club a few blocks away. Had wore my seatbelt there but forgot to put it back on when I left and got pulled over by a city cop about halfway back and got a ticket. The cop was young, tall and lanky. Also, very nervous. He kept putting his hand on his gun and gripping it tight like he was about to drawl on me, so much that it was interfering with him writing the ticket. Then he says to me that I seem nervous. To which I exclaimed, “you keep putting your hand on your gun!” He said it was “just protocol” and I replied “it’s just a seatbelt ticket, I’m not looking to die today.” Small town Indiana, my story checked out and I was sort of danger to this guy but one move that he deemed was inappropriate and I’d been dead that day. For a seatbelt. Cops need to get their shit together before they’re allowed hold a person’s life in their hands.

I've gone through a similar thought process. Was on the highway behind a van I couldn't see past when its brake lights turned on. I thought he was just slowing down a bit so I braked a little bit, turned out there was a car completely stopped in front of him so he was braking HARD. As I was braking I realized "shit, I'm still approaching way too fast" and hit the brakes hard, ABS engaged but I was still going to hit the van. I remember weighing my option, "do I swerve left? No, not enough room. Can I swerve right?", checked the rearview mirror to see a car coming, but asessed he was going slow enough for me to make it without him hitting me (hopefully). Managed to dodge the van with mere centimeters to spare.
That's really interesting. I'm Australian, and we did Hitler, Nazism and the Holocaust throughout the entire year of Year 9 Social Studies class. We spent a really long time on exactly how Hitler came to power, a shorter time on what he did in the lead up to WWII and the failings of international diplomacy that enabled him, and then a long time on the Holocaust (which I knew nothing about beforehand and am still traumatised from that class).
It’s more complicated than that, in my opinion anyway. Productivity has been mainly driven by capital investment in technology, so should the returns of that investment accrue to the employee or the person who invested in the capital? Technology also creates new type of jobs, typically higher skilled, which do pay much better. For example, before the steam shovel was invented you might have needed 100 laborers to do the work of one steam shovel operator. The laborers might have earned, for example $5/hr. But if you add up their total wages it’s $500/hr. So you invest in a steam shovel at $100,000 and now you pay one person $50/hr. Total pay went down, but that one high-skilled operator is earning 10x what the low skilled laborers earned. There are also now people employed in the production of steam shovels. It’s hard to quantify all this, but the point stands that the value of increased productivity should not all accrue to labor - some of it should, but how much? There is also value being provided to the employee that is not paid. Jobs become easier, safer, more interesting. Digging with a shovel all day is back-breaking work whether you are paid $5 or $50. So the benefits of capital investment to the employee can’t be fully captured with pay. There is no incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies if the benefits just end up getting paid out in wages.

Haha Michigan here. This was a topic of conversation just this morning in our office. A co worker genuinely told someone this being nice, and was horrified when we told her to not say that if she ever went down south. She was very concerned that she messed up.
I remember watching a documentary on what lead up to the first nuclear bombings of another nation, and I recall that the Imperialist Japanese government was training every citizen in Kamikaze techniques.

Yes, yes I do. Not the military might and capabilities but the threat. Why? Because the US absolutely does not want to invade N. Korea and absolutely does not want a war with N. Korea, and I can conceive of no reason at all why this would change short of N. Korea invading S. Korea or launching missiles that actually hit Japan or S. Korea. Why do you think otherwise? What does N. Korea have that the U.S. would ever want? Heck, it doesn't even have decent market potential for selling capitalist crap and making money. It's too damn and tragically poor. To the extent the U.S. is focusing on a N. Korea that isn't content to sit back behind it's hermit kingdom heavily enforced borders, it is only because N. Korea is developing nukes and keeps threatening to use them. It's that last bit that is the real problem.

Welcome to disinformation. They said the same thing about Iraq and Afghanistan, perhaps you are too young to remember, but a lot of friends got hurt there because of those lies. And worse than that, millions of casualties occurred for Cheney's wars, all to privatize some podunk countries in the middle of nowhere. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.

Filibuster. The Senate made a rule that instead of having someone actually filibuster (which wastes everyone's time), they can just declare they will filibuster, which will then require a 60 person vote to overrule. Technically the 60 person vote is to override the filibuster, not the vote on the bill itself (which requires a simple majority). Budget bills are exempt from any filibuster iirc because otherwise nothing would ever get passed.

Yes, definitely. The government can directly orginate mortgages without a central bank. The government can suck money out of circulation to reduce inflation without raising interest rates. The best way to suck money out of circulation would be a national property tax, with deductions for the replacement cost of non-vacant, non-obsolete improvements and state & local property taxes actually paid. As this would directly tax vacant land, abandoned buildings, and corporations with excessive state & local property tax abatements and not raise the cost of production.

Not economically. Especially if what you wanted was even more slaves. In this situation it seems like genocide is the eggs you have to break to make a slavery omelette. Less of a bonus, and more of a cost of doing business. There's no shortage of sadistic people on earth though so it was obviously a silver lining for some people.
Just to add onto this fact: most Israelis and Palestinians know this is the IDF's official rules of engagement, first you yell stop or ill shoot in Hebrew and Arabic "atzor or Ani ereh, wakef wakef wala Ana batuchak" then of they don't stop you shoot in the air twice, then if they don't stop you shoot their legs. The goal is to stop them from continuing to approach, so they'll fall to the ground, but sometimes they bleed out of you hit their arteries. But at that point, they were given all the chances and warnings. But if the soldiers followed these orders, which it sounds like they did, the IDF won't even bat an eyelash as all orders were followed and they gave it their best try not to resort to violence.
Criticize? No, I made the valid point that it's entirely possible that the story they've given out is false. If you set aside your bias towards the IDF, you'd see that. Or you can be naive enough to believe everything a military force says. I guess all the people in Gitmo are legitimate threats to the U.S.
As an “exchange”, FTX is allowed to offer relatively risky instruments to investors vs. what a bank could offer, but unlike a bank, is not allowed to then leverage investor funds to make loans, etc, and generate income. So unlike a bank, they’re SUPPOSED to maintain a 1:1 ratio of assets on hand to assets invested, to prevent exactly this sort of “run” from occurring. Whereas Wells Fargo for example can loan out people’s money and therefore have less than 100% of the value of assets invested actually on hand at any given time - this is because the FDIC insures those assets to reduce the impact on individual investors if there is a run on the bank.
Bull runs always have crazy shenanigans. There’s always too much money going around, and any lack of spending for advertising causes you to make less. The issue is people never know when the bull run is going to end but, it’s usually always around the time everyone knows it’s happening which means the general population always sees financial stuff as “a waste of money” because by the time they’ve seen it… it is just a waste of money. It’s ironic.

Ultimately, this means that 1) the crypto hedge fund likely does not actually have the necessary assets to act as collateral on their loans, and 2) the exchange doesn’t have enough funds on hand to make investors whole in the event of a run - which was what happened when the news leaked, and people have now just lost most of whatever they had in FTX.

Yes anything can happen in a war I’m not of the belief that the frontline will stay static and where it is now. I think Ukraine liberates more land back over time. I personally have a hard time seeing them getting anywhere near Crimea though. Like I said, time will tell.
Just like everyone knew it wouldn’t happen, and then how the Russians would crush the Ukrainians, then how it was only a matter of time before the Russians won, and then how the Ukrainians could never regain their territory, and how the Russian massive offensive of hundreds of thousands of men and thousands of pieces of armor were going to make major advances…and now how the war is far from over and how impossible it will be for Ukrainian to regain Crimea.

Is this a sportsball metaphor? Who are the Lakers and who are the away team supposed to be? Is Kobe supposed to be representing Ukrainian tanks? Russian (conscripted and don't want to be there) reinforcements? So many questions.

who can forget those glorious russian moments, like when they didn't capture bakhmut, or that other time they didn't capture bahkmut, or when then threw literally thousands of unarmed prisoners into the meat grinder in a failed attempt to capture bakhmut, or when they took a picture of the sign outside of bakhmut and claimed they captured it but then it turned out they didnt. what a country.
There's actually many different ways a tank can be better than another. Higher resistance to explosions, better armor, ability to intercept missiles, ability to fire faster (or with smaller missiles so you can get more inside), bigger space inside (so the people inside are more comfortable or you can put more people if needed), night vision and other gadgets, using fuel efficiently, etc.
Yeah, most likely. I'd say almost every party would be in favor of this except for UP and VOX and a few minor parties like Bildu and CUP. Although I'm not entirely sure about VOX's stance on Ukraine and in UP I feel like the Izquierda Unida/PCE side of it might be more open to sending the tanks. At least the people that are closest to Yolanda Díaz. But who knows.

Mind you, the other political "party" in the coalition is also a coalition itself, with one-half of the "party" (Izquierda Unida) supporting it (or at least keeping it quiet, mainly abstaining but with their leaders supporting it), while the other half (Podemos) openly opposing it.

Her staff. This is VEEP but with a person with seemingly progressive dementia of some sort. She used to be sharp, I’m sure she’s hired very capable people and kept them around long enough that they can basically run the show in between her periods of lucidity. I’m not saying she’s not lucid 100% of the time, but even temporary lapses in memory of judgment have permanent, fatal effects for others. She claims to be very pro gun reform, wanting to make it tougher to get them, but she’s handed scotus to trigger happy republicans who will prevent any reform. She similarly claims to be pro choice, but then enabled the GOP to reverse roe by failing to be as mentally sharp as she once was and letting the gop pull the wool over her eyes - she makes it easy to do.
People take sports incredibly seriously. Coaches at a high level are also working a lot. I think if coaches can do it, Congress people can do it.

Civilian aircraft information is public for obvious safety reasons. Elon's jets are Registration: N628TS, N272BG, N502SX.
Elon's FAA jet single-source information is not doxing. Per your own post: aggregation is (hunting down a person's different profiles and personas and putting them together as one). Yes... But not simply Elon's jet business submitting flight paths. Just FWIW.

In normal countries making drugs an illegal substance could probably work very well , just like in normal countries making guns illegal would work however with America seems like legalizing it would actually be the lesser of two evils with all the demand that's created for the cartels in south America.

No. That’s not how it works. Do you know what happened to alcohol consumption and overdoses in states that legalized weed? They went down, dramatically. If people have access to clean drugs, the money that was spent on prohibition is repurposed to rehabilitation, and aren’t ostracized from society for using, it’s a dramatic reduction in harm. I encourage you to educate yourself on legalization.
Liar. You're selling these systems to UAE and other Arab nations, none of which are under imminent threat (all of which are backed by the US.) The reason you're not selling them to Ukraine is because Russia will flex its muscle in Syria and shut your anti-Iran operations down. End of story.
They could make life more difficult for Israel in disrupting missiles and weapons being supplied to Hezbollah and militants in Gaza, and right now Russia and Israel seem content with the status quo: Israel continues to operate against Iranian targets in Syria, and only provides humanitarian and defensive alert systems, but no weapons.

Your final statement is the logical point. It’s very probable & would sense from a geopolitical perspective given Israel’s geographical location, relations with neighbours & Russia’s relations with countries in the region. Israel appears to be protecting their own interests which make sense, while still providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Your example isn’t great….Israel technically did help (Ukraine up) with humanitarian aid. As for dirty hands, they could face annihilation from their neighbours. As for any excuses Israel have made, they’re very plausible so there’s nothing to suggest they’re lying other than raw emotions.

Not necessarily, you state that they’re lying as Israel is already supplying SA? That’s fine, they didn’t deny that. They stated that they don’t have the capacity which is very possible & there’s no reason to doubt it realistically.
And I was wrong about how much fight Russia had left in it, drained away by parasitic corruption over the years. The Soviet Union was no stranger to corruption (nor was the US to be fair, though in the US it takes different forms), but the Russian Federation is akin to a deer utterly covered in ticks and dropping dead before your eyes. If it didn’t have nukes and biological WMDs (of which we have to assume at least some still work, because if we assume they don’t and they do, it would be catastrophic), I’d even wonder if Ukraine could take the fight to Russia eventually as they bled themselves out on an unyielding defense.
I 110% agree with his visit. I also 110% agree for the support he is giving Ukraine. Russia MUST be stopped, and this doesn’t need to be a political party arguement. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine and is actively killing innocents. They must be stopped now.

He done more for the US than previous presidents, and in either case the US is still here and still strong and will continue to be as long as Republicans don't manage to destroy the country, nor is the status in the Middle East going to change any time soon despite the best intentions of multiple presidents. But Ukraine is being invaded by Russia right now. What the world does to help Ukraine matters right now, it's not going to matter if we wait for Russia to annex Ukraine to help. None of that is stopping the US government from helping Americans more, only the GOP is preventing that from happening.
I simply think anyone who truly believes this world came out of randomness knowing how complex everything is deep down does not believe this but they don't want to be constricted/tied down and they love this world and their desires so much they willing to take science as their religion.
Islam has no issues with science, it doesn't disapprove evolution (aside from the whole species evolving into a different species aka apes into humans which still has not been proven and is a theory) or big bang it just says their is a creator behind those things not randomness.

Deeply sad. In the article it says one of the players got beaten by her mother many times for wanting to participate in athletics. Notably, her mother also tried to stop her from fleeing the country, and the player attempted to commit suicide. I hope one day the player will be able to play soccer again.

Of course the alternative to any religion is to believe the super complex universe, including the mountains, oceans, trees, sun and moon down to living things and the complex biological systems inside each human and animal is all random and came out of no where simply due to evolution.
Today was a very quiet day with no missile strikes or drones. Nothing much happened in general, we didn’t even have any air raid alerts since 5am, which is pretty unusual. It’s very rare that there are so few air raid alerts in a day, but not hearing a new siren every few hours does feel good.
Absolutely. Criminals like these that engage in genocide should know no rest. They should be hunted to the ends of the earth and up to their last breath.

I'd like to believe they'll try to surround Kherson and not enter the city unless it's absolutely necessary (Russians would try to flatten it with artillery and turn it into an urban slog), also secure the dam at Nova Kakhovka before it can potentially be blown, then create a pocket to expand a bridge head on the left bank of the Dnipro crossing at the dam, then spearhead to Melitopol from that direction as I'm going to bet Russia didn't fortify that approach as much, then retake Crimea once land bridge supplies are being strangled, then finish off the Donbas fight.

Oh! That makes complete sense then. I've seen those in action, they're fucking insane. There was video footage relatively early on of them being used to level buildings the lenh of entire blocks. Fuck those things hard.

If Democrats can keep their shit together, soon enough, the Republican party (as we know it) will reach a point where it will either sink and drown or continue swimming, let's not throw it a life preserver, let's put out the best candidate we can offer, one who represents forward-mindedness, reform, vigor, an answer to these rigid reactionaries, the beginning of something, not a candidate at the very end of his career, not someone who won the last election on the basis that he simply "wasn't the other guy". We need a trailblazer, and although I voted for Biden, he's not it. Sure there are plenty of moments where he has impressed me, met or exceeded expectations, and certainly moments where ha has not. I will continue to support him, but he's just not it for 2024.

Your characterization is completely wrong. No, his husband never did characterize his reactions as "robotic", he very much pushed back against that idea. Neither have I ever heard anyone of his staff characterize him this way. Having a tight control over strong emotions when needed has nothing to do with being robotic, neither has being an introvert.

The reality is capital has a totally different tax system that works different than income taxes paid on wages like us normies. Rich people don't pay income taxes generally because they make money off assets for which highly favorable expensing rules and favorable tax rates apply. The top tax rate being 40% is irrelevant if you are selling stock or real estate and paying like 15%. It's a joke.

LOL! They will not stop shitting on this man and I'm here for it. Even Republicans have started turning on him more and more recently. He might actually see some consequences for all he's done. Revenge is a dish best served cold as they say.

There's this thing called accelerated depreciation. Many real estate companies are not 'profitable' until the position is liquidated and a capital gain is made. This is normal and completely legal.

Agreed they need better monitoring and more frequent shutoff/diversion control along lines. I live near an ocean transfer point and shore tanks sit behind tertiary coffer dams and secondary containment pools. The same pipeline that feeds these tanks sits at the bottom of a small mountain. A few years ago, a city engineer flagged a run of this pipe for a sub working on a city highway project, the as-built drawings were incorrect and a neighbourhood was showered with Bunker C until the excavator operator got his bucket uncurled to direct the flow downward…. Into yards, a couple of streams- it was a mess. Two houses were destroyed due to basements full of oil. They could not stop the gravity-driven flow because it wasn’t driven by a pump or gas pressure that could be shut down and trying to stop a mass of crude flowing downhill by “putting your finger on top of the straw” would have risked causing vacuum-induced pipeline collapse miles uphill and more leaks in worse locations. We need triple layer, human-proof safeguards, company-posted cash bonds and company-funded response teams.
No clue just yet. I want to go see the impact but I haven't had to time since I work all the time and to my knowledge it's blocked off 😕 I'll ask around and keep an update. Huge clean up effort though , that they are trying to keep under wraps. Farmland, underground water reservoirs are being affected though also the water. They just won't come out and say anything.
RIGA, Latvia — Steep Russian casualties in key battles in eastern Ukraine have prompted an unusual public outcry — and sharp criticism of military commanders — by surviving soldiers and family members of recently conscripted fighters, who say their units were led to slaughter in poorly planned operations.
The uproar over battlefield losses near Vuhledar in the Donetsk region prompted an official statement from the Russian Defense Ministry, which sought to play down the reportedly high death toll among soldiers in the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade, which led Moscow’s offensive in the area.

“Due to the competent actions of the commanders, the losses among the marines over this period do not exceed 1 percent of the combat personnel and 7 percent of the wounded, a significant part of whom have already returned to duty,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in its statement, issued on Monday.

Doesn’t stop them from claiming Lincoln. Everyone loves Lincoln. He usually ranks as the best President for historians and the general public. Born poor, studied and worked hard, great orator, freed slaves (that’s Khalessi level stuff), kept country together, etc. Also, he was an ugly guy: “Mr. Lincoln's person was ungainly. He was six feet four inches in height; a little stooped in the shoulders; his legs and arms were long; his feet and hands large; his forehead was high. His head was over the average size. His eyes were gray. His face and forehead were wrinkled even in his youth. They deepened with age, 'as streams their channels deeper wear.' Generally he was a very sad man, and his countenance indicated it. But when he warmed up all sadness vanished, his face was radiant and glowing, and almost gave expression to his thoughts before his tongue would utter them.”.

Exactly what i came here to say. I doubt Putin and Russia as we currently know it will be around by then. I don't see them building any new nukes. Hell they might not even have an army when this is over.
So, what you're saying to me, is that the Western inspectors would know so much more about how Soviet and post Soviet rockets work, that they would be able to identify massive flaws in the entire Russian strategic rocket fleet and keep those flaws secret from the massive entirety of the highly skilled experts on the Russian end, on the off chance that the Russians wouldn't identify these threats and when they went to use them, the rockets wouldn't work?

Hi. Author of the OPEN-RISOP here. I'm a former SIOP advisor who also was in the intelligence community. I suspect that most of the Russian ICBMs and SLBMs are targeted against the United States. The Russians would most likely use their "sub-strategic" nuclear weapons (cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles, and gravity bombs) to hold European and Asian targets at risk. Just my two cents.

This fundamentally misunderstands several things. We inspect their missiles under New START. The count is generally accurate.

“It is in the public interest to appoint a special prosecutor to independently manage an investigation and prosecution based on recent developments, including the former president’s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election and the sitting president’s stated intention to be a candidate as well.".

Then, American prosecutor Jack Smith came along and took charge, sending his investigators on an aggressive mission to win back reluctant witnesses—by targeting the tight-lipped politicians and militant nationalists who had kept them silent.
It's not even just practically unreliable. The chain of custody on that was corrupted so badly that it and everything to do with it is completely inadmissible for any court anywhere in the United States.
You'd have to appeal a ruling on that evidence all the way up there, somehow, and if they did rule this admissible it would destroy criminal prosecution rules in the US overnight. There would be no restrictions on valid and invalid evidence. Abolishing the idea of chain of custody is beyond insane.

The mainstream media articles that GQP-types claim "verified everything" (based on a post-Giuliani copy of the drive) actually point out that very little was verified, and many things were modified (and folders of photos added) after the date the laptop was allegedly dropped off, apparently by someone who didn't understand that computers record creation and modification times. IIRC the modification date was coincidentally a few days after Giuliani claimed to have gotten hold of the copy of the drive.

As I understand it, the FBI got the laptop fairly early on, but the shop owner saved a copy of the drive and passed it along to Giuliani.
Actually that's not the whole story. Haaretz reported yesterday. Netanyahu wanted Ukraine to vote against the motion. Zelensky told him that in exchange for a vote in his favor or official abstention, he needed military support for the war. Netanyahu declined to commit military help but told him they could speak about it at a later point and Zelensky gave the order for the UA representative not to show up so that UA keeps the door open if Netanyahu chooses to help in exchange for a favorable vote. In this case Ukraine did not officially abstain either, they did not vote and abstention requires a vote.

Jews moved back to Israel over the course of many decades. This started in the late 1800s and didn't involve violence or theft. It was just immigration. Of course there was also a population of Jews that had never left in the first place.

Difficult? He doesn't give a shit about what Israel does to Palestinians. He actively supports Azerbaijan's ethnic cleansing campaigns and ongoing invasion while he is being invaded lol. The Ukrainian people absolutely need help but people need to quit acting like the politicians are beacons of democracy. They are remnants of corruption that are simply not Russian. That doesn't mean cut funding, it does mean he's not the second coming of Jesus and these types of decisions absolutely should be paid attention to, noted and acted on when the pattern becomes clear.

Yes. Hilarious. These midwesterners living around me love Desantis and can’t stop talking about voting for him. I ask them if they follow Florida politics and they don’t. I ask if he has actually said he is running and they don’t know. They are all in on Desantis because Fox News has told them to be. They can’t tell you one thing about him. He won’t need charisma or policy or anything to win over the Trump crowd. They will March right in line.

Exactly. This act is a bridge too far ..... unless Trump is the nominee. Well then they'll ruthlessly support him. There's no moral stand these people will take when power is at stake.

Secular Jews are overwhelmingly Democrat and/or progressive, but there are striations in every surface; Republican non-religious Jews definitely exist, including Trump supporters. Many secular Jews are supporters of Israel, but that support has different expressions for different people; there's J Street and there's AIPAC. Big ticket two-party politics tends to murder nuance, but plenty of Jews (religious and secular) support Israel and Palestine and just want to create a peaceful solution.
While I agree that we should stop the Chinese government from being able to collect all the data on tik tok users. We let every American and European company scour and scrape every action online to sell things back to us. Every single thing you've ever done online is stored on a thousand different servers globally. Google and Microsoft can recreate your entire life if they wanted to. It would probably take them 5 minutes.
Also, that doesn't take into account the possibility of the ccp being able to influence our society by means of suggestion(read: prioritizing content that furthers their agenda).

I've been using linux since the late 90s. I use it on literally everything I own except my daily driver. I run my own home's routers, switches, media and file servers, backup server, smart home server, I even have a home dns server and intranet. Using salvaged and refurbished hardware for all of it.

I think it's more that he has certain rules he follows. Always attack and never accept defeat. Use monikers on enemies so your slower followers can remember why they don't like that person. Referring to oneself in anyway negative must never be spoken, always deflect and project. Use positive adverbs and adjectives as often as possible when talking about oneself or anyone on their side. Last but not least ALWAYS make it about himself.
It's not short sighted to take Fox News' broadcasting history into account the last 20 years and flip this case the other direction to be vastly more expansive than the standard boilerplate and the law itself (and most precedents used to justify it here) are very much in the wrong here and most social media usage and the disinformation spreads used to justify bad faith behavior demonstratively prove it.

Yes. And it's so practiced after decades, he now has the deepest of grooves established he cannot deviate. And his wear and tear shows in bizarre ways because he stays on the track even when he shouldn't.

That’s great. We still have elected leaders in office who stand with fascism. And that is because of the other ones that refuse to root them out. They will always keep coming back if they aren’t dealt with. Next time will be more than just a few cops who didn’t get the memo.

Sociopathy + privilege. Most learn to mimic empathy as a defense mechanism but a special class of them, like Trump, never did, because he never had anything to defend against. No matter what he did, his money and prestige afforded him sycophants and hangers-on who could feed his Narcissistic Supply in return for a chance for some of the crumbs at his table. It would never occur to him to learn something like faking empathy because there was never incentive.
Unfortunately, not every. My sister's husband, for example. I can't even imagine what he's hoping for. I guess I'd have to tie my arms to the chair in order not to kill myself with facepalms.
Russia, however, is A) running out of money to prop up the Ruble, B) their economy is contracting steadily and increasingly from sanctions, C) they're seeing cracks in their allies support, D) haven't shown the ability ramp up their military industrial complex to even provide their soldiers enough working armaments or keep up with losses in Ukraine (and reports are that they are smuggling appliances to salvage the chips needed for basic systems), E) are not fielding professional soldiers with these mobilizations due to lack of training and support, and F) have not improved their logistics and are having to fight withing a short distance of captured roadways and railways.

Lol. Sure. If you're in a warehouse full of food with 10 other people, if you kill seven of them and make two go missing in Siberia there's plenty of food left for whoever isn't dead.

But what would have been the benefit of keeping thousands and thousands of dead languages from disappearing over the course of human history? To what end?
I'm saying that speaking a different language and growing up in a different culture gives an individual a unique perspective on various aspects of life, which in turn leads to a more diverse and creative world.

Shit take. We could create a new language for that and not have to have any languages die. Espescially when killing languages is part of cultural genocide. Language can literally change the ways our brains work, so loosing languages means we can loose capacity to develop new and better ways of understanding the world around us.

Esperanto? I've read about many other such attempts. But learning a foreign language remains hard, even when it's designed to be easy. It's also much harder to get people to learn a newly-designed language that nobody speaks and is therefore useless, instead of an already-widespread language that is readily useful.
Honestly that’s the best I would hope for. Torture and mistreatment of POWs is never justifiable and should be investigated seriously and punished severely. Without excusing it, even the most experienced and disciplined armies can’t completely eradicate this problem because it’s one of the darker sides of human nature. What’s important is that these incidents aren’t systematic and that the perpetrators are made examples of. If Ukraine does the latter, perhaps it will embarrass the US and other paragons of humanitarianism into following suit.
No justification. Hold them responsible for what they do. But let's be very clear - it's hard to trust the Russians in any way because they have proven to applaud torture against Ukrainians. Russians at home loved that video, by all accounts. Russians here cheered.

This, unfortunately. War makes monsters of us all. Terror bombing Ukrainian cities doesn't help. I can't imagine what I'd do if I'd lost friends and loved ones to the cogs of Putin's neo-fascist regime.

Superiority is not perfection. While it’s good to aim for perfection, it’s important to value things that are imperfectly better than the alternatives.
So according to Mr present only matters, Bangladesh 1971 genocide, kashmiri pandits genocide in 90s are just hoax aren't they. Cuz one is where west supported Pakistan and other is where west kept it's mouth shut and supported Pakistan. There is a world out there other than the hyped ukraine. Even if the above happened today or like Mumbai attack, the generous and morally high west gave advice to India that keep the business going with pakistan. So keep your circus to yourselves. India has always helped passively to even foes, e.g. Operation Dost where even after criticizing India on Kashmir, India is aiding help to turkey and for your ignorance, India also send medical supplies to ukraine. We are not uncle sam or morally high west to go poke nose to claim ourselves morally high and teach others how to be.
They trade a lot, significant technological and industrial partnerships (including military equipments) etc.

We don't need any promises from anyone. We're not starting or stopping anything that doesn't help with our interests. I'm sure that 'right now' you mentioned will not take much time to happen and when it does either it will be becuz bad people are doing bas shit like in Iraq or will ignore like Bangladesh or when Pakistan started several wars with India. Let's not forget how west turned blind eye when shit hit fan during departure of US from Afghanistan. Not our monkey, not our circus.
What the fuck...I served for 5 years. It makes feel physically ill that this guy is in Congress. Is it all a huge Psy op to make us lose faith in the system? Campaign finance ties to Russian oligarchy money. How is there no safe guard against this kind of thing? Isn't this defrauding the United States of America? How is this not a felony? I just want to be in a room with this guy. I'm not trying to vent some rage fantasy but this guy makes me angry in a way I'm not okay with. I want him gone.
Everyone here kids, but the fact the the GOP (perhaps the majority of Congress) considers The Small Business and the Space and Science Committees to be the least prestigious committees worthy of enough for a sociopathic and pathogically lying high school drop out to sit on as some sort of busy work, is pretty much a damning indictment of Congress and the GOP.

Makes sense. His PhD defense in small businessology was so compelling it won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. It also won four categories of Nobel Prize.

Yeah, but it might actually be a blessing in disguise for them. If they get him appointed Speaker l then they can absolutely vilify him 24 hours a day and cast all the blame on their inability to get stuff done on him. Which would sure beat working for a living.
This is in contrast to typical establishment Republican politicans, who have always sought to consolidate power and fall in line because some people understand the importance of being a key to the kingdom, rather than to be the king themselves.

but on this one? this is disgraceful. these 20 are halting the business of the government so that they can try to force things to be passed that republicans were unable to pass when they had larger majorities and the senate (things like term limitations and a balanced budget act.) if they could not get them when they had large majorities, how are they supposed to get them now when they have essentially no majority in 1 part of 1 of the 3 branches?

Err, no, no we didn't. The Shah was already the legal sovereign of Iran, who was deposed after Mossadegh refused to step down when ordered. Mossadegh also proceeded to dissolve parliament. The US then backed the Shah's return to power. A very different scenario to "installed.".

Republicans have been really openly pro-Russia. We know Russian troll farms have been astroturfing online areas. We know Russian money is and has been flowing into our political process.

Democratically elected, initially. Then decided that laws didn't apply to him (like being legally dismissed by his head of state) and literally deposed the Shah (his head of state), and tried to shore up his own personal power after dissolving parliament. You're defending another authoritarian who ran his own coup, acting like he was some innocent hero of the people instead of just another player in the geopolitical mess that is Iran.

Kroger employs 465,000 people. If they do this to everyone of them every year they can save about $70million a year which they then can use for executive bonuses, stock buybacks, political contributions, and to pay their legal team so they never get in trouble and can keep doing it.

worked for kroger for around 6 months. probably the worst job I ever had. not bc the job itself was terrible but bc management insisted on making things terrible. also, they promised special sick-pay for anyone who got covid but didn't actually give it to myself and others. but really the worst part was management being complete dickbags.

The issue with that line of thinking is that in both Afghanistan situations, the conquering power had their own government installed and that government was in various ways in power in a lot of the country. Here, they're struggling to hold the outlying areas closest to the Russian border. If the Russians managed to take Kyiv or kill Zelenskyy, then the comparison would be correct. That's why people think this won't last that long. They've lost >100,000 troops and don't even have control of Ukraine.

>What does this rule change mean for you? In short, domestic law enforcement officials now have access to huge troves of American communications, obtained without warrants, that they can use to put people in cages. FBI agents don’t need to have any “national security” related reason to plug your name, email address, phone number, or other “selector” into the NSA’s gargantuan data trove. They can simply poke around in your private information in the course of totally routine investigations. And if they find something that suggests, say, involvement in illegal drug activity, they can send that information to local or state police. That means information the NSA collects for purposes of so-called “national security” will be used by police to lock up ordinary Americans for routine crimes.

Exactly. I guess he figured those crimes small enough and long ago enough that they didn't matter, but still, didn't he consider one of his many lies might unravel, and then the whole mess just collapse in on him?
Just like when he threatened the girl that he could make her disappear like her friend, or his helicopter crash that killed 3 top executives at his casinos while he was under investigation for money laundering. He even leased a different helicopter and didn’t use one of his many because his name is on them, he is often known for not wanting the trump name being shown for negative press, he even would have his name covered up when things were taken in for repairs, like a previous landing accident with his helicopter.
Exactly! People like him, putin and kim have just been given everything they want their whole entire life. They have never done anything themselves even a days work. It’s like they were raised to be sociopaths. The good news is that no dictators ever truly get to live without the consequences in the end. Really when you look into it they’re no different than manson, full of shit losers who cant accept the consequences of their actions and blame everyone else for their own faults.
This is ridiculous. One of the main uses of civilian satellites is military applications. The DoD is the biggest customer of civilian satellite capacity in the world.
Exactly. Can’t trust SpaceX to deliver a payload or retrieve a crew from the ISS without creating a hostage situation. Cut them off cold while Musk is in charge.

That is a scary possibility and a can of worms Starlink absolutely does not want to open, which is why they repeatedly emphasize that it is a civilian and humanitarian communications network. Nevermind the legal snafu weaponizing Starlink would cause in terms of export control, there is an escalatory issue here as a piece of technology that can be extremely dangerous if misused by bad actors.

The point is that Starlink doesn't want to be subject to that level of restriction to begin with; if the US government gets involved, it's already over, and suddenly Starlink is subject to regulatory review and sanctioning by every country in the world on the grounds that it's a dual purpose weapons platform. That's why it's against their TOS.

He has shown a single talent: knowing how to ensnare talented and competent engineers so that they can build wonderful things despite his constant and counterproductive interference and megalomania. I'm in IT. I saw his many comments on Twitter - he is an absolute fraud. It was never clearer than when I saw him speak his mind on my own field of expertise for a change. What an insufferable, incomprehensibly stupid, pretentious ass-clown. My God.

American companies can not export military use or dual use technologies without extensive regulation, ITAR being the most prominent. Phased array radars used to be common restricted on this basis, but things like rocket engines, GPS, inertial guidance packages, etc are all obviously things that can be used for military purposes. Stepping back this is seemingly obvious, the US doesn't want random companies exporting the technology to easily make strategic weapons without oversight. Boeing and Raytheon aren't just donating or selling arms to the UA, it is channeled through the government. Absent a contract, SpaceX and Starlink are not in a comparable position.

Sadly the American public as a rule takes elections as they come instead of punishing its political parties (primarily the Republicans) in multiple consecutive election cycles like they should if they want results, to the point the Republicans gerrymander themselves enough corrupt mitigation even if the public at large did go 'Maybe Republicans should be punished in 2024 for forming the Tea Party/Freedom Caucus in 2010 given it still has relevant corrupt and fraudulent impacts today...'.

Stock trades. It's totally legal and totally cool for members of Congress to use inside info to make timely investments. They can't share that info with anyone else, technically speaking, but that's where the rough $500k probably comes from. Congress only reports in ranges so it's hard to pinpoint statistics. Point is, that Redditor isn't completely pulling numbers out of thin air.
For the MRA vaccines specifically, there were only a very VERY small amount of facilities in the world that were properly equipped to make them. If Bill had shared the patent to other facilities, there would have been a flood of infective or even poisonous bootleg vaccines that would have made the situation worse and eroded trust in COVID vaccines as a whole.
Upon seeing the requirements to manufacture the vaccines, they would admit that they wouldn't be able to do so and move on. But if we went full "open source" and if one unscrupulous manufacturer tried to improvise for the missing equipment and sell through the black market or lied about quality approval, we could face something like a tainted Nestle Baby formula incident, which would then create orders of magnitudes more conspiracy theories and distrust in vaccines as a whole (just look at all the conspiracy that came from the one vial with metal shavings in it).

Yes. But conservatives already don’t like gates. For reasons I don’t entirely understand. But liberals love to jerk off gates. Despite him being deeply illiberal. So I gave trump credit for the cages.
I live in ShenZhen and all of the QR code checks are still in place from public transport to public buildings. I don’t know about work places as of yet, but nothing has changed in my area.
“During the cold war, the anticommunist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence. If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime's atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn't go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom. A scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system; an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them.

And yeah, I don't think seizure warnings go far enough. But in that case it's more reasonable because only a small percentage of people are susceptible and they should know to avoid it. But in the case of addiction, everyone is susceptible to varying degrees. And there's no good way to know ahead of time how susceptible you are, unless you've already experienced addiction.
The PiS just tries to distract from their own problems and their issues with tje EU (especially since Germany criticized their law-reforms).
Generally yes, but in case of Poland it has nothing to do with geo-politics - the PiS just tries to distract from domestic problems, even though they get a shitload of Money from Germany through the EU already. Their nationalistic voters love when they use Germany as a punching bag. But there is no substance to it and no one in Germany takes it seriously.

Net contributions don't really matter, %GDP contributions matter. Do you have those numbers, just curious. It'd be like arguing that the USA is putting its fair share into NATO if it cut its contributions by 1000%. It'd still be putting in more than poorer nations. But the actual amount isn't what matters... it's the amount vs gdp. Obviously Iceland isn't going to put in as much as Germany, but by only looking at total amounts, you are overlooking that vital part of it.

Polish victim and inferiority complex. Someone wronged them 80 years ago and ever since, Nationalists are milking that for votes.
Except Fettermen has been up front about going to therapy to correct it, and it has not impaired his thinking. Have you known anyone who has had a stroke, especially a non elderly person? Speech impediments are normal and generally fixable. It is something Ive seen and dealt with in my own family, including one sister that had her first stroke at the age of 28 (currently shows no signs of a previous stroke, despite having at least 5 known large events. Only remaining physical symptoms is she apparently has a black dot in her vision of her left eye. Speech and vision previously severely affected). That people justify Hershel and demonize Fettermen for a physical, explained, treated issue that does not impair his thinking skill is exactly the lack of critical thinking and comprehension I am talking about.

The population isn't buying electric cars because they want them or think they are better. They are buying them because the government people decided it was better. It makes everyone's taxes and cost of living go up. If the electric car was truly the superior vehicle, the government wouldn't need these incentives. Also, electric cars aren't really all that environmentally friendly. Yes they don't pollute at the back of the car, but the energy needed to make them go has to be produced somewhere. The environmentalist can hold up solar and wind, but people tend to charge their cars at night, and wind is unreliable and needs fossil fuel plants to back it up. A lot of the energy is lost in the transfer as well between the electrical lines and the actual charging. It also requires mining of rare metals and aluminum that make red water that can't be recycled.
Absolutely. And we’re moving there. But it’s not quick and each country has different challenges. In all of my comments, I’ve only brought that point up. Also the battery issue (which is important), but simply saying this, people have assumed I’m against the change. So much for discussion.

Fossile fuel car requires specially designated and constructed depots for refueling. I believe that says quite a lot about how much worse fossile fuel is compared to rechargable batteries.
Everyone freaking out over this but have no problem with sanctions that reduce the food in the mouths of the youth i affected countries. It’s the same thing and still the most peaceful path.
Did you call the US a terrorist regime when they attacked North Korean, Vietnam, funded terrorism in Afghanistan, invaded Afghanistan, invaded Iraq, funded military militia in South American countries, is funding Israel even though they are committing similar crimes in Palestina as Russia is doing in Ukraine?

I don’t think they want that. They want no business done with Russia, and any unfortunate examples of such “no business” is just blood on the hands of the Russian leadership.

They want the Russian leadership to be disposed of or choose their people over their greed. If they will not choose their people and kin over greed and corruption then the Russian populace must topple them. Every Russian going about their day making money for the state and propping up the country directly leads to dead Ukrainians. If they don’t want to face the consequences of profiteering from belligerency then they should hold their leadership accountable.
I lived in NY for 25 years and am aware of the rural components as well as the politics at large in the state(I still keep up). Those tend to be conservative places, not really democrats. They would not have went for the toughest gun laws in the country if they were what you were saying. For years it was difficult to travel with a gun until that got brought to the courts, like other ones of their gun laws. In many areas it is difficult to get things like pistols and the SAFE act is incredibly confusing(almost by design). NY in general is incredibly hostile towards self defense, if you defend yourself with a gun, you will most likely still go to jail even if it was justified, you have a "duty to retreat" in NY.

Probably. It could have been a staffer that brought something like a daily briefing and misplaced a page that ended up in some other stack of papers. It could be as simple as that. But it could also be worse. I fully support investigating this issue to find out what happened and consequences for whoever actually misplaced the documents.

he make his choice to fight for his country with his people as sacrifice so he can say "Ukraine still fighting" and also take massive debt from all the weaponry that ensure none of the future Ukrainian children have any future but work to pay that debt.
Brilliant. Okay, good, we have a goal. But before I get the public working on this, what should we be urging - Ukraine roll over and let Putin just take whatever he wants? Or Russia to stop his wars of conquest where he intentionally shells the shit out of civilian areas to try and use mass death to cow ukraine into surrender?

Translated: "Anyone ready for russia to rearm and fortify their shaky positions, while they insist the only option they'll listen to is total surrender and letting them keep southern ukraine.".

"imperialism, state policy, practice, or advocacy of extending power and dominion, especially by direct territorial acquisition or by gaining political and economic control of other areas. Because it always involves the use of power, whether military or economic or some subtler form, imperialism has often been considered morally reprehensible".

Yeah! I said the same thing back in the 40s. World War 2 dragged on way too long because Europe wasn't willing to negotiate with Hitler and find a middle ground. He wanted to conquer everyone, and all the Allies wanted to live, free, with their countries intact. But nobody was willing to find a compromise where Hitler was awarded, say, half of what he conquered, and then left alone in peace to rearm and fortify, and presumably pinkie-swear to never start trouble again.

Now? Where the fuck have you been for the last three months? I'm a trans person, it's not "banning drag" it's trans genocide -- they're banning drag but specifically on a way that let's them criminalize trans people existing, if they aren't writing trans people into these laws directly. They're banning the only thing keeping our suicide attempts at "better than coin flip odds.".

Phrases like “adult cabaret” or “drag show” or “female impersonator” don’t really have set legal definitions, so yeah, they’re essentially using that ambiguity to establish legal definitions that categorize gender-nonconformity as inherently sexual and obscene. Once they do that, they can just rail about how anyone opposing them is pro-obscenity. It’s easy to just look at this as “well, kids don’t need to be at drag shows, and they say it’s only about obscene shows anyways,” but what they’re doing is really dangerous because it’s establishing that anyone Republicans consider to be male doing something that Republicans consider to be feminine is obscene and a danger to children.

So.... Guns around kids = just fine with Republicans while drag shows = danger to society... There is something very wrong with this kind of value system. The idea that it's better to endanger children of being shot than expose them to campy performances is mind blowingly absurd.
No it wasn't, the Republicans could dump him today just like they could have then, but once they really do dump him (if they ever do) then the same price will have to be paid: they will have Trump and his base turn against them. You say that if they'd dumped Trump at his second impeachment hearing then they'd have won these midterms, but that discounts how bad the GOP messaging would have been these last two years with Trump raging and campaigning against them as opposed to campaigning for them. Imagine what the focus would have been without the GOP running interference on all the investigations into Trump these last two years (mainly because of how complicit so much of the GOP is for Trump's attempted coup).
Yes. I would actually really love to deal with them directly if they want to go there. I will stand with Dems and sane conservatives that I dont agree with like Liz Cheney to deal with them.

This is a clownish move, and it's right when the DOJ looks like it's going to actually go for him personally on tax evasion (and his tax returns are in the hands of the Libs in Congress... After six years lol).

From 2002 to 2003, the NYTimes, MSNBC, Faux, CNN, etc operated as stenographers for the Bush admin, bullhorning any propaganda that co-presidents Cheney-Bush wished. But there were many journalist who wouldn't compromise and got it right. Landay and Strobel from Knight Ridder reported actual facts about Iraq before George the stupid invaded. Giving the entire US a heads up to Cheney's ginned up intel & propaganda. The below article was written well before the invasion and is part of a series of about 25 articles that Landay and Strobel had written before the invasion.
To add veracity to the Downing Street Memo, the below article was written well before the invasion and is part of a series of about 25 articles that Landay and Strobel had written before the invasion. Bush/Cheney were ginning up the false intel to support a decision to invade. You might not have followed this back then, but I did closely. We all knew it was a complete bullshit invasion. The Brits did a post mortem (Iraq Inquiry aka the Chilcot Inquiry), check into that. The Chilcot Inquiry was scathing indictment of all involved and Blair did all but shite himself begging not to be prosecuted for war crimes.

why do we not discuss this in a thread that's actually about what happened today? there's like three other ones in this sub alone.
Victims were recruited by British citizens by misrepresenting their intention to enter into a marriage/cohabitation relationship and the existence of genuine feelings of love (the loverboy method). They were later transported and housed in buildings in Ilfov county where, by exercising acts of physical violence and mental coercion (through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debts), they were sexually exploited by group members by forcing them to perform demonstrations pornographic for the purpose of producing and disseminating material of such a nature through social media platforms and by submitting to the execution of a work, in a forced manner, in order to obtain important financial benefits consisting of the sums of money obtained as a result of accessing the materials by users.

In the case it was noted that, at the beginning of 2021, 4 suspects (two British citizens and two Romanian citizens) constituted an organized criminal group with a view to committing crimes on the territory of Romania, but also of other countries, such as the United States of America and Great Britain, of the crime of human trafficking.

Thanks! I’m doing well as long as this transplant holds out. Dialysis was horrible. It’s been the majority of my life now, and frankly I have a pretty decent life. Not perfect but very decent.

Jesse Hammons, a transgender man diagnosed with gender dysphoria, was denied a hysterectomy to remove his uterus in 2020 after his scheduled surgeon discovered Hammons was transgender, citing a hospital policy that prohibits medical personnel from providing gender-affirming health care to transgender individuals.

Yeah absolutely. I think we agree with each other and I just misunderstood your reply. I was just clarifying the beef is with hospital policy not the doctor.
What does that have to do with the claim that a change will allow "100 percent' of the talent to be utilized?... I'm not commenting on the factual points of his statement, I just can't get behind politicians padding their opinions with PR bullshit. If he uses it for such an unnecessary point what else is he spinning? This isn't just a 'him' problem, it's a problem across the political spectrum of the planet and some individuals abuse it more than others but it's always there because there are people who will defend it out of political tribal instinct. If people stopped accepting it we might get a better class of politicians and policies overall. Good luck with that though. People are suckers for flimflam promises across the board.
Technically he isn't wrong most of the jobs require mandatory English,india is the second largest speaking country currently behind US but only about 10 percent of Indians speak English maybe it may have gone up.my point is india really isn't able to utilise it's talent pool.nobody can utilise 100 percent of course but imagine not being ableto get job even with all the knowledge simply because of language moreover the notion that he mentioned hindi and Other regional language is the key here it means Tamil Telugu can get there jobs by learning in there own language.
Also the fact that Russia has a reasonable large Jewish population and ties with Israel. I'm not saying I don't think Israel should not help more, but there are definitely well documents reasons they want to be an intermediary between both sides. I think people don't realise how complicated international politics actually is.
You do realize that they’d love that, right? Of course you don’t. Because of that aid and the treaty it came with the US exerts a control over their arms and technology exports. You don’t think the IDI can replace that three billion with unrestricted sales? They can. And beyond that we get first dibs on a lot of things they develop. Israel currently does not have enough Iron Dome batteries for themselves but the US has a few. Why did they give any to the US when they don’t have enough for themselves? That aid and the treaty it came with.

From Israel's perspective, preventing a a terrorist group that is actively attacking them from acquiring more weapons and preventing their main enemy from staging an invasion force on their border under the cover of fighting Syrian rebel groups are immediate national security concerns. Israel is worried about the development of the Iranian arms industry, especially Iran's nuclear program. However, their current strategy, is to engage in targeted bombing of infrastructure and the assassination of scientists and engineers critical to the Iranian arms industry and weapons development programs. I will grant you that this strategy is proving to be an obstacle, but not an existential threat, to the growth of Iranian arms industry.
This area is well within the Przewodów village limit, The stirke is said to have happened 6.4kms from Ukraine border according to polish goverment, the approximate distance from the center to the border is about 7-10Kms. This is not a big differnce in area of strike. Not to mention, Lviv and Kyiv co-ordinates that was taken city center which must not be the case it must have been targets in the vicinity of the city. This is well within the range.
Remember we're negotiating with Russia, quietly. Most likely a misfire. I think we're throwing them a bone in the form of a little cover. Realpolitik.

It's not too far fetched. And there is no better time to fake a russian strike in Poland when Russia are currently launching a barrage of strikes at Ukraine.

Yes, that is true. Underestimating a military power is not the right thing to do. Thanks for your positive feedback, will be more careful with my words going forward.
Why wouldn't it be systemic? There's a culture put into system that breeds the kind of criminals Russia takes for soldiers. Ever seen hidden camera videos of Russian barracks? The dysfunction of Russian military (and most other state institutions) is endemic at this point. They beat, rape, loot and pillage because that's pretty much what they were allowed to do at home, under superficially more rules and an umbrella of legitimacy from higher ups (who trade in contraband and goods they can write off as part of corruption). There's also a reason not an insignificant percentage of Russian conscripts don't object prison sentences all that much when tried for desertion, for example -- prison and military "carreer" in Russia are a bit like choosing between sleeping in shit or vomit.
100%. Nobody in the West who looks at him as some sort of counter-cultural alternative knows anything about him, but he's being mistreated so he must be Nelson Mandela. Navalny's not become a symbol of resistance in Russia because he's not different enough from the status quo. Russia's left, such as they are, would never choose him. And we think Morgan Freeman is bad.

Disgraceful. Never in the history of our country has there been such fanatical and corrupt usage of power. In all branches. Only one connecting name… Trump. Always has been above the law but hopefully that “always” turns to “not anymore”. Fuck all these cowards and their craziness.

It’s incredible, really. The democrats own the White House, house of reps, and the tie breaker in the senate, yet everything is the republicans fault.
Plan A it is then - its what we’re all really hoping for… voting, political activism, change to rank choice voting, raising the number of congress to represent the actual number of people, placing same ethical standards on scotus as all other justice but the 30 and under have to vote vote vote and get into politics-people that supported Bernie need to seriously fund this movement (gotta find a berniesque wealthy types to help fund this…) then healthcare, unions, stop corps from owning housing, in place programs like uk where government pays 25% of purchase price for first time home buyers - look at whose doing it best in the world and replicate. We need to put people in office that have the best goals for citizens nd can’t self profit off this service. There’s no reason why someone who made 50k a year before being elected is worth millions by the end of thier first term in office.

Even some of the moderate Rs that I talk to justify the gerrymander. They're like "Well, Dems collapsed in the rural areas and stopped competing there, so it's kind of their fault too." And the worst part is -- there's some truth to it. We won like 60 of 72 counties in Wisconsin in the 2008 election (obviously a high water mark) but Democrats regularly used to win most of the counties in the western half of the state up until 2010, and we had strong rural grassroots operations led by congressmen like Dave Obey and Ron Kind.
Why was this needed? As redditors may remember, it is pretty much standard for Oregon Republican lawmakers to when it looks like a vote isn't going to go their way. This is a blue state with voters who want action on climate change, wildfire mitigation, homeless assistance, limits on timber companies being allowed to do huge aerial cropdust sprays of pesticides near waterways & so on.

The separation is due to Palestinians who don't want to be Israeli (totally understandable) and want their own territory (also totally understandable)- which they have - and self governance, but they voted in terrorists organizations who have been blocking all future elections from happening for decades and turned Palestine into an authoritarian terrorist state and refuse to actuality govern or help Palestinians or improve their lives, outside of using Palestinian hospitals and schools as terrorist bases and Palestinian children as human shields. This is well documented by Amnesty International.
Worst case scenario would be partisan state legislatures ignoring the popular vote in a presidential election and giving their state electors to the losing candidate that is in their political party.
This would likely cause massive protests and unrest as many Americans and political candidates would not tolerate their votes being ignored. It could devolve into chaos and violence where states may try to split with the US or have situations where both presidential candidates claim victory and start running the country separately where government agencies and parts of the military pick sides and ends up resulting in a unimaginable civil war and bloodbath perhaps leading to the collapse of the United States.

It is unlawful for a person in the United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated FTO. (The term “material support or resources” is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b)(1) as ” any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who maybe or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.” 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b)(2) provides that for these purposes “the term ‘training’ means instruction or teaching designed to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge.” 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b)(3) further provides that for these purposes the term ‘expert advice or assistance’ means advice or assistance derived from scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge.’’.
Worse. As mercs, their managers should be assassinated, and troops shot on site. They’re 3rd party combatants. They don’t get the pleasure of war crime limitations. They certainly don’t respect any of them. A good rich person could put a bounty on their heads instead of fucking around in twitter.
You're absolutely right about his COVID response, but I still don't know about the cake-walk part. He did something despicable practically every day of his presidency, and was pretty widely despised. He even sent everyone money, and still lost.
YouTube, social media censor information. The CDC, WHO, NIH will post updates on their website that you may or may not notice. Social media will not allow discussion for at least a couple of weeks, USA MSM won’t cover it for a couple of months, if at all and only after it’s news in other countries. It’s needless censorship because it ultimately comes out. Nothing really sinister about the information reported, we are learning about it and the new variants. It just comes across weird because of the strict censorship. Viruses should be a political. It’s happened throughout the entire pandemic. Yes, there are a few side effects for a few people for every medicine. Refusing to allow discussion encourages fear mongering. For the longest time discussion on the origin was prohibited. What possible reason is there to eliminate it? People will not faint if it was a lab leak, it would just encourage stronger safety protocols and possibly call for discussion about increasing gain of function. If it was from a wet market,how did it make the leap, what safety protocols and testing should be put in place? Both of these items are above my pay grade so I don’t know the answer. Would like more open discussion because real science is always tested, discussed, peer reviewed.

This strikes me as a similar move to England’s 1950’s Royal World Tour that the at-the-time Princess Elizabeth was embarking on. Imperial influence waning, time to do a show and tell with the locals. Pretty tone deaf.
There is nothing out of the ordinary with printing the money of a foreign state, several other countries relinquish printing to foreign nations: The Guinean franc, Ethiopian birr, Ugandan shilling and Botswana pula are produced in the United Kingdom, The Mauritanian ouguiya, Eritrean nakfa, Tanzanian shilling and Zambian kwacha are produced in Germany, and The Liberian dollar is printed in the United States. But strangely, only France is ever brought up.

The relationships aren't mutally beneficial anymore. One of the major reasons is that the public opinion in France (and by extension the French government) has become much more sensitive to issues of corruption and sustainable development. There were many awful things that French companies and African elites did in the past that went with the blessing of the French government. Some African regimes miss that blessed period and just want a "protector" which would fund their lavish lifestyles and help them keep the power, but without imposing their ethics. That's why they don't go with Germany either, or Japan, even though Germany has no recent history with Africa and Japan never had, and both would be ideal candidates as healthier alternatives to France and the UK.
Also fair: I just learned that while they were affiliated, the Fenian Brotherhood that operated in Canada was actually founded in North America. So maybe the ones in Ireland weren't that bad. But the ones that were here? Fuck 'em.
Now I haven't heard that story, but I assume becasue of my passing familiarity with how they message that kind of stuff that it's probably one that seemingly came out of nowhere, and then they run a segment on it in each of the talking head primetime shows in order with each host giving their own unique take on it. Maybe it's like "woke-ism destroying America" or that kind of a spin on it. So in one night, if you watch straight through you get to hear from three separate people three times in a sarcastic, know-it-all tone how its so terrible and awful, and scary. Oh yeah, BE SCARED. Becasue this meaningless thing that happened is evidence that BIG SCARY THING is also happening, and it's probably those Libruls who are doing it. Then if you watch over the next week or even two weeks they may do recurring follow segments like this, following up on the "situation." The repetition is the key here as part of a strategy designed to make viewers outraged about it over time.

Because "they" the Amungme , Kamoro and other highlanders have NEVER practiced cannibalism unlike Americans like Antron Singleton and two dozen others I could mention. YOUR allegation that "they" have "cannibalistic beginnings" is PURE RACISM about indigenous nations & individuals about whom you are making up fantasy. Now if you or Michael Rockefeller want to sick your nose into Asmat territory asking if they would mind your family building a cargo harbour for exporting Papuan gold, copper and silver that your family wants to loot at Indonesian gunpoint; that's your choice just don't complain if they do decide to remove the colonial trouble maker they've got their hands on.
I apologise, that came out all wrong. I absolutely generalised in a way might have offended you. Sorry, I take it back.

'Separatists'? Do you mean people fighting for their independence after Indonesia invaded their country? That's not separatism, that's freedom. The west, particularly the US, sold them down the river.

I think he's done fine. COVID / post COVID times haven't been an easy walk in the park. Partly just glad we don't have the continual White House circus.

Irrelevant. Biden proposes a military budget, he doesn't pass it into law. Biden's stance on marijuana reform is equally meaningless. He doesn't make law, Congress does. If legislation legalizing all marijuana use makes it to his desk and he breaks out the veto pen, I'll agree with you. Hell, I'll help you badmouth him but until then, no, you really don't seem to have a grasp on the three branches of government and their respective roles.

You misunderstand. Whoever is the Dem nominee, that person will get my vote, because I like democracy. It has nothing to do with how much I like the Dem nominee.
In any case, there's a middle ground here. Cut through the noise of the comments and just read the news as the story develops. The Capitol mob and the sentencing happening now is important and getting a lot of coverage, but I'm much more concerned about the congressmen involved in the false elector plan. Both are dominoes in the bigger picture of American democracy. So when you say "when it starts actually happening" for many, those two dominoes toppling, those two lines being crossed, means it is actually happening. Barbara Walter, who's been studying, teaching, and writing about US democracy and civil war for decades, mentioned in an interview that the Capitol mob (I'm paraphrasing here) got people to start seeing the bigger picture and looking at how we got here. For her, it started happening a long time ago. For others, it won't be happening until there's a gun in their face.

I'm glad the number is rising, but it's too little, too late. I really feel like people defending, and celebrating the lack of action...less than a third showing up, and that's just registered voters, the population is much higher, don't understand how horrible those numbers are.
Younger voters complain...constantly about the older crowd being in politics....but the old people vote.

Boomers show up, and vote for their ideologies, and people their age. Change needs to come from the younger generation. it doesn't happen magically. Only 27% of voters 18-29 showed up. That's 73% that didn't. If you want to point fingers, start with the 18-29 year olds that refuse to vote. The younger voters could push these dinosaurs out of office. They don't. twitter burns, and complaining aren't action.

Yeah who needs democracy or adherence to law or institutions. Certainly all of those highly funded and logistically difficult social programs and public works projects that Reddit expects from their governments will still be possible in a violent society where politics are dealt at the barrel of a gun. It’s not like humans have had thousands of years of civilization to develop the current systems as a correction of past mistakes. What could go wrong? Thanks Reddit!
Japanese people are known around the world to be hospitable to foreigners, they might hate us (its a known fact some Japaneses cant stand foreigners) but most of the time they will treat you ok, so, imagine this old lady, she seems harmless, she leads you, she makes you feel home, all you can think of is "Damn, this old lady is wasting her time helping my sorry ass", shes telling you how to properly cook your Yakiniku (Japanese BBQ), all of the sudden she asks the questions, what you do for living, are you X or Y faith oriented.

If you are talking about Romneycare, that was never a good label - the bill was passed by strong liberal supermajorities in the state legislature, and Romney (who was then genuinely acting as one of those centrist or even liberal leaning northeastern RINO governors - he moved a lot to the right in his 2012 presidential run) only reluctantly signed the bill, while vetoing various parts of it (those vetoes were overridden by the state legislature).

If it weren't for the emails, she might have entered office with bigger majorities than Biden started with, and with the election serving as a bigger repudiation of Trump than 2020 was, so I wouldn't have been surprised if she not only got the SCOTUS liberal and got some decent stuff via reconciliation but also managed to succeed where Obama failed in 2013 and got a comprehensive immigration reform compromise passed. Plus maybe she'd have pivoted again and pushed for TPP, which would have been a good help in trying to contain China.

Maybe I'm just a pessimist, but I don't know that I agree. Without the support of the majority of China, any resistance from HK would've been crushed - as it was in 2019. As for China, an analysis of why most Russians didn't protest or oppose Putin's war in Ukraine, TL;DR most Russians are simply so disengaged with politics that they basically subconsciously lie to themselves to justify staying as far away from the political system as possible because decades of political oppression has taught the average Russian that nothing good comes of that and there's nothing they can do about it.
2. Release them. They will tell everyone about the horrid conditions of their imprisonment. That will cause the people to hate the regime even more.

They can mow their people down, true, but they are raising a generation of people that bitterly hate them. They tried and failed 2 years ago at a terrible cost. They will have to be downright draconian to pull it off in full view of the world. How far are these bastards willing to go?
So yes they're not natives Close to 2000 years have past they have no claims, unless believe the people of Turkey should give all their land to the Greeks, in fact so should Ukraine Since parts of Ukraine were controlled by Greeks, so what are you going to say Ukraine so give their territory to Greece?
This is an insane take. Like claiming that Native Americans are not native to America anymore because they are outnumbered by European colonizers.

Yeah, except I’m not wrong. Maybe take a few minutes to learn the first thing about the history of antisemitism in Europe, and why the Holocaust was the straw that broke the camel’s back and made all the Jews realise that they’re not safe there, so they left.

I genuinely feel sorry for the North Korean peasants (let's face it they aren't citizens they're peasants, although if someone wants to re educate me on that feel free!) Remember a few years back when one or 2 Soldiers managed to get to South Korea and they were malnourished and full of lice. If that's the general state of the "Million Man Army" I'd hate to see the nick of the civilians. Not to mention they have a fat wee dick in charge of them, imagine that, you're starving and not sure when you next get a slice of bread and that fat little cunt tells you that you can't get his style of haircut and that he hits hole in ones that travel round the world first(that latter is a bit of hyperbole but there was a hole in 1 claim at one point but am too lazy to look it up lol).
Nope. It's a hermit kingdom and she has insane amounts of power to do whatever she wants in nork. She definitely thinks she's hot shit. Look at a certain politician we recently had, you'd think it was insecurity, but the guy really was just that conceited.
If you think queer people are only killed through the courts there you're a complete idiot. It's very common in qatar for queer people to be killed by their own family and for there to be no investigation at all into their deaths. I volunteer for the rainbow railroad and have helped Qatari queers to get asylum here. There's a reason queer folk are desperate to get the hell out of that country. And most of the middle east, African (including christian Africa), Asia, eastern Europe and parts of South America for that matter. It's lethal to exist as a queer person in a lot of the world.

More seriously, though, consider for a moment how much it took to get Donald Trump into the White House: It took a nationally televised cable propaganda network spending thirty years tainting the Democratic brand and elevating conservatism, it took Trump having a top rated prime time reality TV show in which he played the part of the (fictitious) competent corporate executive, Trump's win required Republicans winning the Senate in 2014 and Antonin Scalia dying and Mitch McConnell refusing to hold a vote on his replacement, Trump's win depended on hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars being spent on repeated investigations exonerating Hillary Clinton from any wrongdoing in Benghazi, Trump's win needed James Comey to have a boy scout moment the week before the election by holding an historically unprecedented public news conference about an ongoing federal investigation into an American citizen (which he would clarify was not cause for prosecution just five days later, two days before the election), had Russians not hacked Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump probably wouldn't have won, if Russians hadn't targeted Trump, Sanders, and Stein supporters with propaganda Trump probably wouldn't have won, hell, if Republicans hadn't fully milked the Monica Lewenski scandal for all the political clout they could it might have made the difference in 2016.

The next step is Moore vs Harper. If this goes the way conservatives want, then state legislatures will be able to make up any rules they want concerning elections and the courts won't be able to challenge them.
Suppose a Republican controlled state legislature decides that only Republicans can run in state level races. Right now, this would make for an easy court case and this rule would be struck down. What if courts weren't allowed to intervene, though? The only way to change this law would be to elect state legislators to change it, but the only ones allowed to run would be Republicans.

Alternatively, a state legislature could pass a law saying that they get final say on any election results and can overturn them for any reason. With no way to challenge this in court, Republicans wouldn't need to worry about "stop the steal." If they lost, they'd simply overturn the results and there would be no mechanism to challenge them. (Again, you could elect someone else, but then the state legislature would just overturn that and install their preferred candidate.).

In very short, it's no surprise that banks flourished in Switzerland. The culture fits just right. But also, it's no surprise that the Red Cross was created in Switzerland, just like how this country is also a world champion in terms of international mediation. Swiss diplomats are literally embedded in all sorts of international conflict mediation (including between the US and Iran, as these countries have no direct relationship anymore, the middlemen are Swiss diplomats)...
Yeah, I get that. But there's a large amount of time in between when the preliminary results are done and when they get the final results after tabulating the ranks. It's not transport time that accounts for that.

Exactly. It'll play to their base and piss off the "opposition". Funny enough the polarizing nature of it benefits "opposition" as well since it gives their base something to be collectively angry about. It benefits the media too as outrage drives clicks, increasing ad revenue. It's a win, win, win scenario for all parties involved.

The international agreement is that small (I believe <5lb) exclusively meteorological (China said this was 'primarily' meteorological) balloons don't violate sovereignty. But countries are still supposed to inform countries their balloons will fly over (China didn't).

It's worth pointing out China is upset about American surveillance balloons they've alleged (without evidence) are over their sovereign airspace. They're simultaneously trying to claim their surveillance balloon is acceptable, but nobody else's is.
I look forward to a return to an era of comity when we all understood that we're on the same team, facts and hoensty are really fucking essential, and that we generally try to get a win for everyone while taking in each others disagreements. I look forward to a time when we collectively agree that sedition and insurrection are bad things that all Americans have a responsibility to condemn in the most unequivocal terms possible, and until we get there, unfortunately, we're kinda stuck making sure republicans are as far away from power, and repeatedly pointing out when their media machine is working to corrode support for the only party fighting to preserve the Constitutional order.
Yes. They're old, their friends are old, and we've seen how intent they are on protecting their own. Just look at how Pelosi had to walk back her spousal stock trading stance - and for good damn reason.

True, it's officially peace time. But only for as long as Russia or China still see America as strong enough to deter them. Western Europe has been too complacent and Russia doesn't see Western European powers as more than a speed bump in terms of protecting NATO's eastern flank. If America were to take the same approach in failing to modernize and increase its military capability there would be both an invasion of Taiwan and an invasion of the Baltics in the next few years with more invasions to follow after that.
Bruh indeed. Nobody could come close to what the US had in the 80s-90s. Nowadays, China's tech (stolen, whatever, point is they have it) and production level is much closer than Russia, or any other adversary had back then. That's what it's about.

Is it really "peace time" when Russia has declared a holy war against the West threatening to attack Nato countries, China is building up to invade Taiwan and threatening the US with war in case US were to interfere, North Korea is doing missile tests it claims are simulations attacks against the US and Iranian regime is acquiring nuclear weapons while its leader is promising death to America?

With who? It's for sure not going to be Russia now. And China would HAVE to take over Taiwan before it could expand anywhere...and like good luck with that. That operation would make Russia losses in Ukraine look small.

We're pretty far past warning signs at this point... We're at phase 3 or so of a Russian + opportunists plan to destroy the country by leveraging it's own weaknesses (poorly funded schools, simmering racism/homophobia/etc, criminal wealth disparity, pay-to-elect "politicians", unregulated cryptocurrency financial markets, a huge pile of economic investment being placed into hot air + hopes and dreams while ignoring the fundamental needs of the people, mountains of insecure soft targets, and no laws in place to protect workers or regulating propaganda, etc). We have had one of the most easily corrupted systems of governance in existence for about a century, and never fixed it. Now the back push to fix any of these things because they are "woke" is probably too high... I'm genuinely terrified to know the future of our country. Warning signs to me were back in 2007 or so.

Something about the way Germany behaves now makes me upset. It's cowardly that modern Germans are so against supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons. The biggest bully of the 20th century now suddenly is ardently against weaponizing a nation that is struggling to survive. They act like they have a reason to be so against war. For once, Germany can thrive and be on the good side of history, but they seem so afraid. Like they're morality-bound to never be involved in war again. It's fine to be involved with war. Just don't fucking do what you all did throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Shit gets to me.
Meloni has been very open and vocal about providing weapons and support for Ukraine - despite her other politics, on Ukraine she’s been consistently solid since taking office and has pretty much locked step with the rest of NATO.

Sorry. Haven’t had any coffee yet this morning. Memories of German dithering and Macron spending all that time trying to get the diplomatic limelight got me a little salty.
There's also the fact that (and I don't mean to make light of this at all) some of the aging Republican base, and some of the most loyal older Republican voters, were basically told by Republican leadership that they didn't need to get the vaccine or wear masks during a deadly pandemic. So...uh...you know. Some of those most loyal Republican voters lost their lives due to bizarre and misleading health "advice" from Republican leadership.

Unfortunately Republicans hold an overwhelming majority in the wisconsin state assembly and senate because of gerrymandering. Evers is only able to veto their stuff by the thinnest of margins, they almost won a supermajority that could've overriden his veto power. So it'll be another 4 years of Evers begging them to do something good for wisconsin and the Republicans will not even do their jobs. Evers tried to get them to do something about guns by calling special sessions and the Republicans just gavel in and gavel out the session within minutes.
“The book is about a solar geoengineering project conceived by a Texas oil-industry billionaire named T.R. Schmidt.[1] Schmidt builds a launcher on the Texas-Mexico border to fire sulfur into the air, a form of stratospheric aerosol injection intended to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight into space.[2] “.
There is nothing in modern social governance more dangerous than intersectional Neo-Bolshevik Communism - which, if you haven't noticed currently dictates every aspect of modern partisan orthodoxy.

Eh. I don't think billionaires should exist in a world where we so inefficiently distribute resources already. Billions is an amount of money and power no one person should have.

The Alliance put an experimental chemical(pax) into the atmosphere as an experiment to decrease aggression(in hopes of pacifying the population and preventing another rebellion)- the chemical worked a little too well and removed the motivation of people to do literally anything- this killed the overwhelming majority of the population. A small percentage of the population survived and had an opposite adverse reaction, and became the space cannibals known as Reavers.
At the turn of the 20th century, Johnson's lyrics eloquently captured the solemn yet hopeful appeal for the liberty of Black Americans. Set against the religious invocation of God and the promise of freedom, the song was later adopted by NAACP and prominently used as a rallying cry during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.”.
“Often referred to as "The Black National Anthem," Lift Every Voice and Sing was a hymn written as a poem by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson in 1900. His brother, John Rosamond Johnson (1873-1954), composed the music for the lyrics. A choir of 500 schoolchildren at the segregated Stanton School, where James Weldon Johnson was principal, first performed the song in public in Jacksonville, Florida to celebrate President Abraham Lincoln's birthday.

Hi LimitedSwimmer. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
I mean, they do upload their general plans for the years 2025, 2030 & 2050 on a regular basis & then have their associated groups act in a like fashion. For example, the Climate plan that SCOTUS nuked a few months ago is a direct copy of a plan created by the UNFCCC & CBD (a subset of the UNFCCC) - even though SCOTUS made a decision on the Obama introduced legislation, multiple state governments have implemented their own cookie-cutter versions like San Diego’s “Riding to 2050” plan & illinois’ ICAP program. None of these plans are original ideas created by American business or politicians but by an international organization that seeks to make gradual changes across the globe on the sub-national & national levels. All starts with ICLEI buying out local board members & there’s plenty of videos you can watch of citizens at city council meetings expressing discontent with proposed climate programs that generally lead to unwarranted taxation & hardly any true mitigation of climate disasters but the board members who’ve been bought inevitably pass the programs administered to them from outside the country.
I'm not sure about that. I remember when the debt hit 1 trillion around 1990 and there were predictions that Social Security and medicare would be backrupt by 2000 and the US in general would be bankrupt by that point. It never happened. I'm not saying our debt is irrelevant, but it is not a priority to eliminate it. It is impirtant to keep an adequate debt to gdp ratio though.

and you have Kevin McCarthy, my Kevin, and he's maybe doing an ok job. he's Speaker now, not a lot of people know that but it's true, and I came in, we're talking after Obama so you know it was bad, we had a Total and Complete Failure of the Democrats as usual because they can't Govern, they can't be Presidential, they said I'm the Most Amazing President probably that we've ever had. you look at Washinon, you look at Lincoln, I mean we're talking Andrew Jackson even has a run for his money ok, you could put them all together, add them all up, and they couldn't even come close to President Trump. I did more in 4 years than any Administration in History. don't forget, Day One, I was set up by Obama, he was Pretend Nice, you know what I'm talking about, and there were no more problems until Sleepy Joe decided to work with Obama and Crooked Hillary to steal the Election yet again. they Rigged it, we have it all on Tape, and we're gonna be going probably to the Highest Court In The Land, and we'll maybe get a Fair Shake, we'll see what happens.

No. The FBI is full of Republican sycophants that are desperately trying to influence politics.. just like with Hillary's emails. They've had an open case trying to "parallel construction" the stolen information on the laptop more than two years. Hunter's lawyers have been getting regular subpoenas for his personal and business records from the FBI... the lawyers must have a pretty good idea that the FBI has no case left so now is the time to go on the offensive because there's no more legal harm to Hunter that's not public knowledge. They won't be feeding the FBI more evidence at this point.

Sorry, “everyone with a brain knows because it’s basic common sense that if a laptop existed that was evidence of crimes committed by the POTUS’s son and had been in the possession of the opposition party for over a year they would have handed it to the FBI by now and they haven’t because it’s not real and they obtained the photos by guessing someone’s password and downloading them which is illegal and if they engage law enforcement they’ll be the ones getting charged.”.

About time. He must be a masochist taking shit for this long. Oh wait….he may be a masochist. Haha. Poor guy. Traumatic brain injury as a toddler. Poor impulse control as an adult. Yeesh.

Unless you can show me evidence of either the actual laptop existing (as is the claim that requires evidence) or that they’ve engaged law enforcement at any point in the process rather than actively avoided getting them involved?
"The iron cross itself is, however the specific one they use was the decal on vehicles for the Wehrmacht. The one seen on Ukrainian vehicles is straight, with 90 degree angles and looks like a + sign. The Balkenkreuz the Bundeswehr uses has curved edges and resembles looks like the cross used by other nations. These symbols are seen on armoured vehicles not donated by Germany, but on things such as the BMP or on trucks. Ukraine also scrubbed the Balkenkreuz off of vehicles such as the Flakpanzer Gepard.".
"Pacification" campaigns, though, were conducted multiple times before WWII under various circumstances, in response to several Ukrainian uprisings. It's not like Ukrainians always loved the Polish rule before OUN.

I feel that Poles quite ingore the fact that their country was in imperial rule of significant parts of Ukraine and then pikachu-face when they see that they were not always revered.

I'd like to add a note, that there were a lot of effort put by both nazis and soviets to clash Ukrainian and Polish populaces during the war. We can't forget about that.
I've been saying this since the beginning. I'm old enough to know our human history- they are just going to kill all those people. Nothing is going to change. They'll just kill them all. Such a damn shame.

They are rolling the dice. Either the population will be terrified and return home, or they will go full rebellion. The last one to try this is Myanmar. They currently have a civil war.

These examples don't even include the lashes, torture, forced confessions, and denial of basic medical attention that is routine in Iranian political prisoners treatment if you're lucky enough not be killed during the process of being charged for whatever insanity they throw at you. People have been fighting against the regime for 43 years and only now is the world paying attention to how brutal the situation there is.

Didn't Ukraine want that for themselves after previous Russian aggression, including annexing Crimea several years earlier? Russia has been a threat to Ukraine for some time, especially after moving to a democracy very recently, with Russia having a fear it would be successful and hurt the influence Russia has on the region, and especially what Russians would think about a successful democracy in their neighbor. The US may have supported their joining the UN, and ultimately NATO, but the reasons for Ukraine to do so are entirely based upon Russian aggression. Even the primary reason for the US to really get involved, beyond the humanitarian reasons, is because Russian has actively been working on undermining democracies in the western world.
Yes. There has been historic US involvement in Ukraine, but, by and large, Ukrainians have chosen that between two giants, they prefer the one that hasn’t committed genocide against their population and promises an improved economy. Small states affirmatively choose between great powers and pretending that those choices are simply a foregone conclusion robs those small states of their agency. Ukraine has the right to choose the US as its protector; Russia has the right to be fearful of the West. Russia does not have a right to compel obedience through invasion.
He has to run again. In his mind, it's the only thing keeping him from being indicted. I honestly don't know whether he could get the nomination over DeSantis, but my dream scenario is they both run, DeSantis gets the nomination, and Trump runs as an independent, splitting the conservative vote. He's easily narcissistic enough to knowingly sink Republican's chances of retaking the white house in order to be able to proclaim his immunity from prosecution for another 2 years because he's a political candidate. It's not even like DeSantis could promise him a pardon if he drops out, because 1, there's no way Trump can let himself believe DeSantis could succeed where Trump failed, and 2, it looks like some of the charges coming are at the State level, so a presidential pardon wouldn't reach that far.
Absolutely! I'm hoping Biden is smart enough to retire with the legacy of having saved us from Trump and someone like Gavin Newsom or Gretchen Whitmer is the nominee.

Yah. A buddy has a sister with a gay best friend. A few times they dragged us to a gay club. I'm a very go with the flow people watching person, so figured the first time it'd at least be interesting. It was indeed. He was into some dude there so I being a few drinks in told that guy to talk to him. Won his respect and everytime I bumped into him after he'd go out of his way to try to find someone to introduce me to. One I actually really talked to and dated for a while. Good times.

Exactly. Distract, deny and deflect while they fumble through your pockets, on the way to looting the Treasury.
Weapons and supplies. It wouldn't make sense to send cash and have Ukraine buy weapons and supplies from other countries. We gotta keep the U.S. military industrial complex fat and happy.
Exactly. Unfortunately, greed makes a human blind to future consequences. Honestly, for Putin, this is just fun for him before he kicks the bucket soon. He already knows he's going be significant in history books whether good or bad.

Exactly. I read the other day that we are giving basically 2.5% of our budget to more or less break down one our biggest adversaries by means of another country. Sadly it came to this but we might as well help them in doing so since they are a peaceful nation and going to war would be catastrophic for the US.

Absolutely. I agree. All I'm saying, we need more balanced spending budgets. Military needs war to profit. I don't think it's all for good reasons most of the time.

Not for the right reasons though. We need to lower costs for healthcare by giving people easier access on checkups and preventative care. However, the cost of healthcare premiums are barely manageable to middle class earner and do not provide much coverage. Most of that money is to pharmaceutical drugs and overpriced hospitals, not actually caring for the patient...

There is more incentive for doctors and pharmaceutical companies to keep Americans sick. Just like military benefits off of fuck-up conflicts. Afghanistan is a perfect example. Just because we spend money trillions of dollars doesn't mean it gives better results. It's how we use it. We just have a corrupt government that exploits vulnerable humans.
Vlad Vexler just posted his thoughts on Lapin/Gerasimov/etc. Very short video. Main point is, "There isn't going to be a scenario in which Russia gets to win this war militarily. What there is going to be is a play for western exhaustion. So Russia's key strategy for victory is not military, it's political"; no clear correlation between military strategy and these leadership changes; "Putin has a history of shuffling around pieces; he loves shuffling around rivals; he loves placing rivals in adjacent positions, or one above the other" - when people make persuasive arguments about how things should be done, Putin loves saying, "Well, you do it now...".
Fuck that. Give them good shit. Countries started decommissioning Leapord 1s almost two decades ago. The state of any that could be supplied would be poor. Enough fucking about, time to start giving them large numbers of good things. Get this ended before the next batch of mobiks start waving around bullets. 5 or 6 countries have hundreds of them and won't be needing them any time soon.
Real antisemitism isn’t the problem. Having that kind of stuff out in the open is very beneficial for some people politically. Criticizing legitimate toxic traits within the Jewish community and in Israeli politics though? That has to be squashed.
“The ultra-Orthodox mutation is a transition from the exiled way of life of the minority that has lived its own life, maintained its way of life and doesn’t provoke foreign rulers, to the new way of life of the minority that lives at the expense of others, an economic parasite, a draft dodger, absolves itself of civilian responsibility and has no real respect for the democratic regime and its principles,” said Kasher, who is a professor emeritus at Tel Aviv University and a recipient of the Israel Prize.

That looks poorly on DeSantis. I hope it keeps him from running for any Office. It is not OK to use people as pawns. Think of the damage he could do allowing this to go on around him in the White House. Oh wait…. We seen it (:

In late 2021, then-District Attorney Cyrus Vance directed a thorough review of the facts and law relating to Mr. Trump’s financial statements. Mr. Vance had been intimately involved in our investigation, attending grand jury presentations, sitting in on certain witness interviews, and receiving regular reports about the progress of the investigation. He concluded that the facts warranted prosecution, and he directed the team to present evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr. Trump and other defendants as soon as reasonably possible.
"I and others have advised you that we have evidence sufficient to establish Mr. Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and we believe that the prosecution would prevail if charges were brought and the matter were tried to an impartial jury. No case is perfect. Whatever the risks of bringing the case may be, I am convinced that a failure to prosecute will pose much greater risks in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice.".

These things constitute wearing a visible religious symbol and thereby put into question the neutrality of the state. Quebecers, especially women, fought to no longer live in a theocracy in the quiet revolution. Those who wish to proselytize, or who feel their religious belief system should permeate other aspects of civil life such as education or dispute settlement, should consider immigrating elsewhere.

All companies, businesses, even governments need to evaluate what actual minimal personal information is actually needed to operate as opposed to wanted and "good to have" off customers to access services and how long do they need the information for. So many companies hold onto personal details long after you have left or stopped using them. Passing info to third parties needs to be banned. Unused accounts need to be deleted and not "paused". Plus a huge crack down on fake call centres with big penalties when raided.
Healthcare companies misuse Personal Identifiable Information too. Some US companies will search for a patient using their Social Security Number instead of assigning them a user ID of some kind. The secondary affect of this is that database tables in those companies are littered with SSNs because it's how you ID people. If just one of those tables gets sent to the wrong person or accessed externally then it's a much bigger problem than if the world finds out User123 takes insulin.
In my experience most chinese canadians don't want anytning to do wjth the CPC. A large number of them back politicians and parties that are against the CPC, are highly religious(which is against communism in general), an increasing number of them are pro marijuana, and regularly prostest anything involving the CPC. For a lot of chinese canadians and chinese people living in Canada, life in Canada has become about enjoying freedoms they don't have in their native country and moving their assets to a place the COC can't possibly touch, which is a big part of the housing issue.
Oh god this. It hurts my feelings that you don't recognize our ability to claim other countries as our own. It hurts my feelings that you question our ability to own the ocean. It hurts my feelings that you ask about our human rights record . It's like you called them fat or something.

Nope. You giving America a pass to do fucked up shit sets precedent for everyone else. Part of why post-USSR Russia feels so entitled to be a cunt to its neighbors.
And torpedoes are easily thwarted with early warning sonar. These jet ski drones are invisible to sonar and radar. They're virtually indistinguishable from the waves they ride in on and can be launched from 50-100 miles away and remotely piloted. Not to mention they're considerably cheaper than guided torpedoes so you could theoretically launch a shitload of them at a grouping of ships. Not saying they're unstoppable, but a zerg attack of like a hundred+ of them against a cluster of ships that wasn't expecting/prepared for them could cause a hell of a distraction from a combined aerial assault. Really just depends what kind of explosion and range you can actually get from them.
Inertial navigation involves differentiating a noisy signal to determine orientation, then using that to subtract a huge acceleration offset due to gravity, then differentiating that twice to go from acceleration to velocity to position. Even the tiniest drift or noise in those sensors will make the answer diverge from reality extremely fast. The MEMS sensors in phones will diverge in seconds. US ITAR classifies sensors with sufficiently low noise and drift to be useful as weapons, you can't export them.
Hey i will agree with you on that standpoint. Zelinskey (sorry if I misspelled his name) but anyways he very very very effectively used social media towards this whole ordeal and it didn't just work but its worked fucking phenomenally IMO. But yeah i hope the west does take out Putler collectively. Bc he's a POS who invaded his neighbor bc he doesn't recognize them as their own sovereign state. Wtf gives his ass the right to recognize any country as a legit country. He should've just worried about his real problems at home instead of going after innocent ppl and bombed schools, hospitals, playgrounds, civilians, civilian neighborhoods, shopping malls, etc... Wow that list could keep on going, oh and MASS kidnapping on a scale of the likes we haven't seen in nearly a century. But since he decided to go that route now hits fate is decided and i predict he'll wither be dead or not in power in less than a year.
Most definitely, government paid commentators . and ......Oh shit who forgot about Trump, he is supposed to get all the awards and this won't settle well.
Furthermore, debt of a government is not akin to debt of a family household. So long as GDP is growing faster than the debt, debt is a good thing. You're growing faster because money is being spent. If you didn't spend that money, you'd be hurting economic growth and holding the country back. Again, so long as the growth outpaces the debt, then there's no issue with massive debt. Again, IF the economy is growing faster than the debt (and it almost always does). This is why America has a great credit rating. We're able to pay our debts -- until we choose not too. Not because we can't, but because we just decide not to pay. Something the United States has never done. Since George Washinon, the United States has made every single debt payment in its history. Republicans are going down the road we've never actually gone to the end of. Its beyond reckless.

Just incredible. "Let's just take the poors and put them in a place somewhere out of the way where they have to do manual labor for their food and shelter and have no opportunities to get out of poverty".
Several of Bolsonaro's allies visited the USA shortly before or during his stay there, which indicates that he probably didn't just go there for some time off and was very likely conspiring with them. One of these allies was no one else other than the (now ex) secretary of public security of Brazil's federal district, which had direct responsability in keeping things safe, but he was spotted visiting Bolsonaro on the eve of the attacks to Brazil's congress and he gave last minute orders to the local police that facilitated the invasion. It's extremely obvious that Bolsonaro went to the USA with the intent of creating a headquarter where he could orchestrate these attacks while being away from Brazil's jurisdiction while he prepares his plan B move, which is to seek Italian citizenship so he can escape extradition in case an arrest warrant is issued for him.
That makes a lot more sense to me. I was so confused about why they are charging an ex-leader when said person didn't "do" anything specificly to kick off the riots thousands of miles away.
Mushrooms helped me quit cigarettes. I had a wonderful evening in the woods and have not hd a cigarette for almost 7 years. Like a light switch , it just shut off the need/want. Now I can smell one from a mile away and it makes me nauseous.
I’d imagine that decriminalization is a significant step towards reducing arrests and administrative costs. Then once it’s decriminalized wouldn’t the next logical step be to make it safe for the people who do use it? IIRC during prohibition, there were attempts to deter alcohol consumption by deliberately poisoning it with methanol, and that didn’t accomplish any reduction in alcohol consumption as far as I’m aware, it simply blinded and killed people. Similarly, keeping the drugs dangerous wouldn’t accomplish anything towards reducing usage, would it?

After my original vaccination and booster, continuing to use masks in public indoor places (also an exception for the gym, and work isn't open to the public, but grocery stores, buses, etc) I eventually caught it from direct physical contact with a family member before they knew they had it. C'est la vie, but I didn't get it randomly and not for 2 years. Plus, I was 100% fine like nothing happened in less than 2 weeks, back to running and everything. No guarantee without vaccination that the recovery would have been so smooth.

He proved the Republican Party can go lower than Dubbya - perhaps if Dubbya had lived in more peoples' heads rent free after he left office, the country would have known better than to let Republicans prove they have no floor, and there simply is no bottom they cannot find a way to sink lower than.

Wow. Thank you for the 500 word essay on over analyzing a Reddit comment. I completely understand the benefits of incumbency but thank you for assuming I do not. Literally the only take away from my comment was don’t get complacent and not everyone thinks Biden is doing as great as the press makes it sound. He is still 100% better than the entire Republican Party but there are other options.

Had Dems lost hard this cycle, it would show that the public wasn't in favor of them at all, which would mean an uphill battle to keep the White House even as the incumbent, and a very high chance of Republicans still maintaining the House and Senate (doesn't happen often, but not outside the realms of possibility).
The reason why it isn't just 'treading water' as you put it is because the next election cycle, assuming trends continue and there's no super unexpected shakeup and neither party entirely shoots it's own foot off doing something ridiculously stupid (and it's Democrats, there's always a chance of that happening any day of the week), Dems will be projected keep the Presidency as the incumbent, to retake the House by a decent margin and gain more seats in the Senate. Then in the follow up midterm they'll have seats to lose while still having an above average possibly of holding the trifecta.

It's a bit of tug-of-war. You're right - information is more accessible. That seems to be the crux of the problem, because it means several things, both positive and negative, including: people thinking they know more than they do; people actually knowing a lot more than they used to (Trump's admin forced a lot of us to learn so much more about how government works and who is in each role); older or less technically savvy people can't adapt, and therefore, still think they can get away with the same things in the same ways without realizing how viral and deep that information can be; corrupt and savvy people realizing that people have more access to info, and thus, employing that idea and those platforms to distract and/or flood the airwaves with a mixture of nonsense and half truths to put space between their trail and those information consumers.
I’m 37. I have this vague memory of statesmanship, but it was also coated in way too much Christianity in government policy, blatant racism, and rampant homophobia. So I guess the answer is it’s only been getting worse for a long time. I’m just sorry you’re experiencing the worst of it so far. Let’s hope we don’t keep digging.
Me neither. I have just had to do exhaustive biblical research for World History courses in college. If you’re following him you haven’t read it, or can’t read. Both are highly likely.
The number of protesters and political prisoners killed after the fall of the Shah by the new Islamic Republic as it consolidated power is estimated by human rights groups to be several thousand.[3][4][5][6][7] According to Tucker's estimations, in the period of 1980 to 1985, between 25,000 to 40,000 Iranians were arrested, 15,000 Iranians were tried and 8,000 to 9,500 Iranians were executed.[2].

Others, including leftists, secular nationalists and Islamist followers of Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari called for a boycott. The turnout among Sunni minorities in Kurdistan and Sistan and Baluchestan Provinces, as well as Shariatmadari's home Azerbaijan was low and number of votes fell down in comparison to the referendum held in January.

It does happen. But when it does, it rarely does without a demonstration of unity of a large number of people. For example, when the power balance between labor and capital + state was renegotiated in the early 20th century in Sweden, in a few instances, tens of thousand of unionists would stare down military units, but bloodshed was largely avoided. A combination of pressure from within and without led to the elites of the time sharing power and money more equally.
Russia will just cut off oil to any nation participating in this illegal scam. From their perspective it's a breach of existing contracts. They are 100% correct.
Its not about the actual military strenh of EU, they had soft diplomatic power over other nations without having a military since WW2 largely due to their status as powerful nations having strong leaders and a modern wealthy society.

putin can't stop selling. oil wells are very unlike most other things in that you really can't just stop extraction - if you do, it's incredibly costly to get things running up again. and oil is expensive to store around. so russia has to sell at capped prices if that's all they can get, cuz making a lil profit is far better than losing a ton of money.

yeah he will want to sell to others, but china and india both have extracted a large discount from russia and this price cap will give them even more leverage going forward. remember, both would absolutely love to pay less for oil, and can make a nice excuse about 'well we WANT to give you more money vladmir, but see we have to buy our own insurance now and our own tankers, so you know... higher costs means lower prices.'.
The modern-day Republican Party is the unholy union of a bunch of really stupid narcissists (mostly the ones at the bottom of the Republican pyramid) and a few very smart narcissists (mostly the ones at the top of the pyramid). The useful idiots don't know it, but the party's only real 'value' or interest is simply to hoard wealth and ruthlessly exploit everyone else to hoard even greater wealth. They'll play any culture war game the idiots want them to, as long as at the end of the day they can ram through midnight legislation to keep the billionaires out of the IRS office.
Beautiful. Raise the voting age, lower the working age, and have an entire class of people that pay taxes to the government but cannot vote for that government.

Remember, no taxation without representation. Technically we should let anyone 16 and up vote. If you're old enough to have a job and have the government take your money, you're old enough to tell them what you want them to do with your money.
You do realize that there are legitimate arguments we are not practicing any kind of proper democracy in this state? Our representative democracy is not necessarily the same as a pure democracy and because of widespread gerrymandering and over/under representation across the country it’s arguable if we even have an accurate representative democracy. If it was all determined by popular vote, there’s proof things would be radically different. Then we have to address the insane money that influences campaigning and legislation as well as the literal corporate takeover of mainstream news that resembles blatant propaganda to influence the masses. Looking at the current state of affairs and arguing it shows democracy doesn’t work isn’t a fair analysis because this is arguably not a working democracy. I haven’t even addressed the extreme politicization of the Supreme Court. Voting matters but it’s not a simple system and there are different kinds of structures for democratic government. I agree the current state of affairs is untenable.

It’s too late now to undo Brexit unfortunately so a second vote wouldn’t matter, and applying for re-entry into the EU would mean unacceptable terms for the UK, so realistically it’s not going to happen. The UK has tariff free trade with the EU, which is better than almost any other country, and closer relationships are being formed as part of a trans Atlantic and pacific agreement with Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It will never come close to making up for the trade lost, but unfortunately when a country effectively votes to sanction itself, there’s not much you can do.
Precisely. The masses were manipulated into voting for a mystery box under the guise of sovereignty (and a touch of xenophobia) only for the manipulators to make a fortune and disappear into the obscurity whence they came.

Yes that was true. But your economy needs to produce that money somehow to be able to give to the farmers. Within the eu UK economy could do that. I am not so sure if that possible now.

They aren't clowns they are citizens who were subjected to sophisticated psychological manipulation.
By the way, in response to your bit that you don't think that Ukraine will survive the upcoming spring offensive by the Russians, rather than agreeing or disagreeing I'd like to point out that a loss in Ukraine could throw America's, and much of Europe's, political situation into chaos.
The aid provided has been predicated on helping Ukraine achieve an overall victory in the war, so if that doesn't happen, all hell might break loose politically, particularly for the Biden administration as they'd have to justify the spending on a losing proxy war, and you can bet that that'll come up in the 2024 election.

Okay let me get this straight . You are saying we are wrong to give Ukraine assistance now becasue we might not give it to them later ( and yes this happens before notably and repeatedly with the Kurds ) and you want American leaders to sit down with Russian leaders to stop. War in ukraine. But you also want us to stay out of Ukraine ?

Did you hear any speaker in the opposition to this motion, eloquent as one of them was... to whom you would delegate the task of deciding for you what you could read? To whom you would give the job of deciding for you? Relieve you of the responsibility of hearing what you might have to hear? Do you know anyone, hands up do you know anyone to whom you'd give this job? Does anyone have a nominee? You mean there's no one in Canada good enough to decide what I can read or hear? I had no idea but there's a law that says there must be such a person or there's a sub-section of some piddling law that says it. Well to hell with that law then, it's inviting you to be liars and hypocrites and to deny what you evidently know already. About this censorious instinct, we basically know all that we need to know and we've known it for a long time. It comes form an old story about another great Englishman, sorry to sound so particular about that this evening, Dr. Samuel Johnson the great lexicographer the author of the first - compiler, I should say - of the first great dictionary of the English language. When it was complete, Dr. Johnson was waited on by both delegations of; the people to congratulate him of the nobility of the quality; of the commons; of the Lords; and also by delegations of respectable ladies of London, who tended on him in his Fleet Street lodgings and congratulated him: "Dr. Johnson," they said, "We are delighted to find that you have not included any indecent or obscene words in your dictionary." "Ladies," said Dr. Johnson, "I congratulate you on being able to look them up".

As for bringing those responsible to justice: Well, the National Transportation Safety Board is a very good, well oiled, if slow moving machine. They, along with the FAA for aircraft mishaps, are well aware that if they publish findings that lay fault, make recommendations etc. that legislators tend to charge and send people to jail and penalize entire industries out of existence. So there's an onus to make sure that all facts are uncovered and blame is laid on those truly responsible. That takes a bit more diligence and investigatory work. For airline accidents, its not uncommon for final reports to take _years_. If we see a final NTSB report on this within a year Ill be surprised. Because the report isn't just going to talk about what went wrong in THIS situation, it'll be diving into systemic procedural or legislative failures - historical inspection, safety and quality procedures, gaps in legislation and regulatory. That takes GOBS of time, you have to research and interview. "The law says this which allowed x to happen. Who _changed_ the law?".
Heh. I've been kicking around taking a course in disaster prep/management - local college has a full program in it.

Hi liveingratitude. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
The current system is actually quite sustainable, it's balanced right now (even has a small excedent), and projected to be balanced on the long term until 2070 at least. There is one projected scenario in which it would have a small deficit around 2030 before being balanced again after a few years. He's changed a lot on why he was doing this reform, the current reason seems to be to reduce the state pensions to give yet another tax break to corporations, but nobody really listens to him anymore, 80% of the population is against that reform and sees clearly that the arguments are bullshit. So what else can he do you ask? Well I'd say go fuck right off.
It's even more insane to also put the burden on new workers to have to continue paying into a system the same as everyone previous but be told you won't get as much and it'll be later in life because the very people enjoying those benefits now didn't budget right.

Yup. The problem is all with that one bad half. Those others. Thankfully there's no problem with tribalism in my tribe, just in that filthy other tribe.
You’re right. There’s no way for them to tell the under 21 military that they can be sent to a war by the government but they aren’t allowed to vote for who that government is. It is absolutely appalling that this used to be the case which is why the protests were so big and loud but stripping it away from the young people in this day and age would devastate their chances of stepping foot in office and they would lose the rather large young conservative voting block that makes up a large portion of our military men and women.
Yep. You can’t smoke cigs under 21 in most states now, but feel free to smoke ducks for money at 18, as long as you film it.

Right. That’s exactly who they are and they were raised by the internet propagandists to be exactly who they are. They were recruited and radicalized from 4chan and gaming forums and targeted to make them as miserable as possible and to blame the misery on women, democrats, minorities, etc. And it works great, they are exactly that and they blame exactly the people they want them to but the issue is they also raised them to live chronically online and these young people don’t leave their houses to vote. Many of them don’t leave their rooms to pee and pee in soda bottles.
What record of turning out votes? His first election he won by 34,000 votes and his second election he gerrymandered away black congressional districts and started a voter intimidation scheme which is the worst we’ve seen in a state with some of the worst voter intimidation practices in the country. Also he ran against Charlie Crist and a against a non existent Florida Democratic Party. Trust me, he’s not the political super star a lot of people think he is. He’s had his political imagine very well crafted in Florida, but that’s going to crumble after he comes under scrutiny for all the dangerous shift he’s said regarding COVID and the vaccine and all his political stunts. Trump was not only popular with the far right, he was a celebrity for forty years and had a hit show on NBC which portrayed him as a successful businessman, DeSantis has a high pitched voice and as much charisma as a tv remote.

Scott began his tenure chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee early last year by making up an award to present to the ex-president at his Palm Beach resort, continued into this year by not intervening in GOP primaries to block Trump-like candidates and ended with Democrats retaining the majority by defeating those mini-Trump candidates.

That is hardly a given. I mean, it took this long for DeSantis to really have a shot against Trump even after everything that happened. That's how lame he is.

Donald Trump was not on the ballot this week for Republican leadership races in Congress, but in several key spots the proxy candidates espousing his approach to politics dealt the ex-president another losing hand.

Famously? It's ridiculous that would be famous considering it was an off-the-cuff comment in the middle of a long interview about a subject that doesn't matter anyway. To my knowledge he didn't embellish his record in any other way - he just remembered his marathon time from 20 years ago. Who cares?

Daily reminder of why so-called independents are generally just embarrassed conservatives. During the Bush years Paul Ryan was considered a bullshitting kook by Republicans but I guess nowadays bullshitting about cruel policies without the overt mean streak is enough to look presidential to a majority of Americans.

As a thinker, he's extremely unknowledgeable and uninterested in actual policy. As a politician he's got some good senses. He knew that the people somehow further to right of himself were gaining power and using it to reduce his own, so even though his policy positions almost entirely overlap with Trump's, it made good political sense to try to reduce Trump's power so he could claw some back. He's a young guy, he's got decades of time left to get shit done.
He could just go for the bald-faced lie: "I am pleased to announce that our objectives in Ukraine are complete. The Ukraine military has rooted out the Nazi influence in their country, and I am confident that ethnic Russians in Ukraine will now have their rights fully protected, so the mission has been a success. Our victorious soldiers will be returning home soon!".
It'll basically be like a corporate acquisition: Russia's fuckup has shown China it needs to boostrap their military industrial complex before they take on the West, so they'll ransack all the design and manufacturing talent and experience out of the crippled Russian MIC, throw away all the trash that they don't want to keep, and then pump shitloads of cash into developing new next-gen kit with no reliance on western parts.

Putin would much rather die than be humiliated. And he'd much rather kill 40 million other people than be humiliated.
They vote not just for a president but the ideas he promotes. Again it just can't handle other forms of democracies and people's desires for its not western right?
Those are other forms of democracies besides just the western ones. Why you refuse peoples freedom in picking what kind of democracy they want and president? Fujimori the dictator who even western institutions admit he used unfair election unlike Pedro Castillo?

Peru has just concluded a presidential election with a single candidate, which was plagued by irregularities. In the words of the OAS electoral mission, the election was "far from free and fair," and does not represent the "authentic popular will" of the Peruvian people." "In all the meetings, the OAS Mission has expressed that it observed a positive electoral process, in which substantive improvements were registered between the first and second rounds. Likewise, that the Mission has not detected serious irregularities.".

Long live authoritarian rulers who controll all aspects of the states because obviously that´s what Peruvians want, release Pedro Castillo and give him the powers to make all the laws that he wants without supervision, give him total control over the military and police, destroy the courts and screw the constitution.

many in Perú don´t want Castillo back, neither they want the new president, the want presidencial elections, after all, they didn´t choose her, She was put as vice-president by Castillo and they are both from the same party, It´s logical to at least for the goverment to renew the democratic mandate and restore order choosing a new president.

the people choose castillo as president, not to be a dictator, nobody can use the excuse of "the voice of the people" to close democratic institutions and absorve It´s powers, also there is something that you need to know, Castillo is against same sex marriage and abortion, Is It also the will of the people to prohibit abortion or homosexual relationships?

It´s way more funny to see how you support a guy who wanted to become a dictator and close the congress without the approval of the people, there´s no guarantee that he will renounce to his new powers in the long run, also the new president wasn´t elected because you can´t organize an election in one day and someone must occupy the office, also She was the vice president who was put in charge by the same Pedro so It´s still the same party in power. Let´s see your reaction if trump or some far right extremists does the same.
What's funny is I hit on the strategy by accident. I'm in sales and work in a very purple state. Basically, it started as a way to make regressives not think I was a communist groomer in drag so they'd still give me money. As time went on, I started leaning into it and now it's a whole conversation about how terrible all of the old guard politicians are regardless of party. How they're all scumbags. If they ask me about trump, I tell them I think he's a piece of shit "but what politicians aren't?" I don't particularly like biden anyway so it's not even like I have to lie to them when I badmouth him. It all culminates in them thinking I'm one of them and they wind up trusting me. I'll take a superficial regressive over a well educated progressive all day when it comes to doing business. They're just so easy to manipulate. They're just lucky that even if they don't take their best interests to heart, I still do but I could totally exploit these people.

I got called lazy by a professor because I didn’t want to sit for the CPA exam and work in public accounting. This after she pushed me to take it for the 5-6th time and I told her I’d spent 15 years in my prior career working 12-14 hour days and I wasn’t going to do it again. It caused me to gain 80lbs, develop liver problems, and my personal relationships were all the worse for it. No job or career is worth my health and family.
The first Congressional Dads Caucus is set to be announced Thursday at a news conference on Capitol Hill, with members of the House introducing the group alongside representatives from nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups including Paid Leave for All, the National Alliance for Caregiving and MomsRising.

Fun fact. In the early 20’s (I believe) Congress was going to vote to make the work week 4 days and 32 hours with the intention of moving it to 3 days and 24 hours in a few years. The reasoning was that technology was making things easier. Guess why that didn’t happen.

For other lovely wonderful things an "unarmed"-but-expecting-that-capture-will-lead-to-death protester can carry or make to defend themself or attack the regime, consider >homemade bombs, caltrops, knives, targeted independent acts of sabotage beforehand, vehicle sabotage, homemade chemical munitions from cleaners, acid bottles, cyberattacks, homemade guns, or just real guns if they have them.< Nasty, nasty stuff. Do not quote me or put me on a watchlist, don't shoot the bloody messenger here. The punishment "death" for something is usually a deterrent, but this is not the situation where doubling down is a good idea. And it's a sign things are spiraling out of control badly for the regime when they're pulling out such insane measures, it's not working, and the grievances of the protesters are growing.
Exactly, remember Myanmar. The world was “deeply concerned™️” and the people were revolting for a strong 5 days, then the tanks started shooting and the bodies began to stack. Now everybody is silent and we have a new dictatorship in the world.
There's actually 5 sides in this conflict, not all of them are obvious yet: the 2%, the polity, the GOP, the DNC, and the historical national narrative and identity. This country runs on precedent and history, and the blueprint already established for this type of conflict is states rights vs the federal govt. The GOP has their base of power in state government. The 2% (who have _way_ more influence cause capitalism), has too much to lose if the country devolves into war, but a relatively peaceful seccession by 20-30 red states doesn't interrupt the economic engine too badly. So the DNC winds up with control of the federal system cause it's the conservatives who are bucking the federal tiger, not the Dems. And the Dems are historically and ideologically a pro peace party. The national narrative, (we've been through this before), _requires_ that we get this resolved in a manner consistent with the highest of our national character/identity traits, because the indoctrination of American exceptionalism we've been fomenting since Washinon chopped down a cherry tree, {yes I know, that was the point}, won't settle for anything less. If we're going to tear it down to the point of secession, (and I don't think anything less will be sufficient to overcome the big lie), we're going to be damn sure to replace it with something much better, or at least negates what brought us here.

But as just one example, when he spoke about Republicans leaning on Christian values and claiming that those on the elite left are fundamentally opposed to that tradition, it struck me that the liberals I know don’t object to Christian values (articulated in this podcast as the celebration of individual liberty, individual dignity and self-government). We’re opposed to Christian institutions that -- for example -- permit (and, in fact, often enable) Catholic priests to molest children without real punishment … or don’t bat an eye at the hypocrisy of one of these televangelists of those tax-exempt Megachurches flying around in private jets while claiming to care about the plight of the poor and downtrodden.
Welcome to the big tent. I’m progressive as hell so he’s been disappointing on the domestic front for me for entirely opposite reasons, but I completely agree that he’s put on a masterclass of foreign policy and that is incredibly relieving after 4 years of Trump lobbing molotov cocktails at our international institutions.
You ignored the GSM part of my comment. You have alarm systems. They are hooked up to either phone or internet to maintain contact with the station, and to send alerts if an alarm gets triggered. Someone comes along with a chainsaw, and cuts the entire group of lines connecting your building to power, phone, and internet. Now they break in to each unit in the building. The alarms will sound but not be sent anywhere, except that one unit. They have a GSM backup connected to their alarm system. It sends an alarm alert via the cellular network. The base station works for many hours on battery, and you typically can't get to the GSM module without triggering a motion or contact. Thieves are arrested, caught in the act.
Global System for Mobile Communications AKA the 2G networks of your phone, that many countries use as the "backplane" of their mobile infra, its mature and reliable tech with widest availability so its kept up for phone calls and SMS as a last resort network.

Oh, I agree. But I would also expect that most museums would go on lock-down once alarms are triggered, with barriers, bars and such. We don't know enough details about this one yet.

Most of the Youtube Ch's I subscribe to are smaller in terms of size, very few baring maybe Game Theory are reely big time plays in the grander for lack of a better term youtube hierarchy, and a most of them have gotten in trouble at some point or another and I'm not talking about when Google's content ID system flags stuff witch is a different issue in and of it's self, but when chanols are directly targeted by so called "copyright holders", I've seen a lot of Ch's just die off cos they were unfairly targeted and the Ch's owner effectively decided that it was'nt worth it to fight back. And most of the time, unless a Ch. has a lot of influence Google will just hand out the strikes and when the Ch. owner sys there innocent Google quickly sends a response saying that they've reveawed the targeted video (witch is more then likely BS most of the time) and that they will uplohld the strike, refusing to elaborate as to why the strike was issued, usually taking a major twitter backlash, threats of google getting sued for acting in bad faith, or that Ch's union stepping in in order to have the decision revoked.

Like, if they want to legislate something about a class of people (eg, CEOs, or people claiming a certain deduction or credit), that might be more legitimate, but then there would also be no reason to request Hunter's returns, in particular, as opposed to however many randomly selected returns that meet those conditions. I really don't see what legitimate purpose they would have to request someone like Hunter Biden's returns, because he's just a citizen, unlike Trump, who, incidentally, also promised to release his returns anyway, so releasing his returns would just be helping him keep his own promise.

Also, what's someone (Trump, DeSantis, some other future GOP President) going to do, release Biden's tax returns that he already voluntarily released? Or Obama's, that he already voluntarily released? Or Clinton's, that he already voluntarily released? Fucking lol.

Whoa my guy. You’ve got a lot of feelings about this. Kinda my point is, you’re pretty fixed in your way and maybe you don’t call it shame but suicidality is an illness. It’s not going to help you or anyone else calling it self centered. It’s a mistake, sure. But you’re really clinging to moralizing it. Suicidal people are sick and need help. They don’t need to be scared straight, they’re past the point of thinking people care anything about them. I have nothing but empathy and understanding for all the emotions that go into those affected by suicide. Maybe I was a little abrasive, but seriously. This is research based and evidenced based shit we’re talking about here - compassion, openness to the conversation and issues around suicide is not condoning it. Neither is saying “died by suicide” - it’s descriptive.

In some ways it's like breaking into a home, being forced out, and running away screaming, "I want that house that's not mine, that I'm not even occupying anymore, before we can talk.".

LOL! Several years ago, I got an alert on my camera app and witnessed a couple of people breaking into my home by watching them, from my job, climb in a basement window. I called the cops to report it, kept dispatch updated in real-time by tracking them on camera from room to room (they were relaxed and making themselves comfortable), cops showed up, were met at the front door (which the burglars cracked open with the chain attached), and they proceeded to smugly inform the clearly annoyed cop that they are in fact squatters. Now that they were ensconced in a house, they 100% believed that the only possible recourse was for a judge to issue them an eviction, which would have taken several months at least. Cop shoulder-bumped my front door while wannabe squatter was mid-sentence, which broke the chain and knocked the man on his ass. His wife ran out of my kitchen, mouth stuffed with my leftover birthday cake, and started shrieking about SQUATTER'S RIGHTS YOU CAN'T TOUCH US, PIGS and they are both taken down, cuffed, and led out.

Interesting. Are they bringing any bargaining power to the table? Because they have none. I hope Ukraine smashes every last one of them out, including crimea, before they say a word about ceasefire. The russians would have shown them no mercy in a reversed scenario.
951 construction workers died on the job in 2021 alone. The year before that, 1,008. These numbers were 14 and 15% lower than average because of Covid lockdowns and job site shutdowns. This is just fatal job site accident deaths, this does not include deaths from occupational diseases. You hear that?
I think someone else’s bid to address deaths by country is more interesting: generally if you kill a reporter it’s to stop information getting out or being collected which would be pretty gender neutral, where by country would give you an indication of what countries are heavily involved in censorship.

Most of the journalists aren't putting their lives on line, most of the journalists ignore important and relevant News and pump out cheap news that gets clicks/retweets. Journalists and editors are also responsible for curating news, manipulating story, pumping out headlines that grab attention and distorts the truth.

I find it impressive that someone could score that high. I recently went through the WAIS-IV. It really puts your mind through the gauntlet. I think they measure cognitive intelligence pretty well. Obviously, there's social intelligence and other types of intelligence that are just as important. Idk though. When people think of smart people they're usually not paying attention to how that person would react with another. There's really only one section of the test that I feel could be influenced by outside factors like education, etc.
Exactly. I know an absolute idiot that is the best fps gamer I have ever met in person. I mean he is incredibly stupid and can't remember basic things he reads. I would say he has a 8th grade reading level in college. His aim wasn't godlike or anything. He outsmarted me every play. It was wild watching him think ahead, and he had a feel for all of the spawn times and locations. It was crazy. He'd let you kill him just to respawn closer to a better weapon that was about to spawn and then roll you 3 or 4 times.
The problem lies in the fact that in India in matters of personal law you have the choice of following the common personal law which has the age as 18 or to follow the personal law of your religion which is partly decided by religious personal law boards. While the Hindu personal law was ammended by passing the Hindu code Bill, the same thing was not done with other personal laws, this was done to appese conservatives of other religions sections (mostly because during the partition of India and Pakistan india lost a lot of educated muslims thereby strenhening the conservative sections, although Pakistan did turn more conservative that came later). There has been a directive principle in the constitution to get rid of religious personal laws and replace them with Unifor Civil law but till now only one state in India has this in place. The current ruling part has been promising UCC for the past 20 years but till now no state under their control has implemented it. (Hope the explanation helps.).
the Pakistani educated folks just go to the US or UK , Pakistan is known to be a human Labour exporter, the country really sucks and people who take education seriously just striaght up lose their conservative nature to a degree and migrate out so only the hard lines zealots are left in the country along with some moderate factions.

What may have been printed in dictionaries in Nazi Germany isn't really very significant as compared the the human atrocities that were committed, and would've still been committed if Hitler ranted on about the "master ethnicity" or whatever absolutely evil insanity at the time.

Jewish custom prohibits inter-faith marriage (this is interpreted differently). Also, during periods of European history inter-faith marriage was illegal to include Nazi Germany. This sort of makes Judaism a de facto race at the very least. In that there's a distinct genetic lineage by virtue of the fact marriage are usually from among one group. Which in turn means births are often from that same group.

Exactly. Those are lobbying groups famously started and run by American Jews. To say that famously Jewish groups “control” a politician, as was said here, sounds a helluva lot like the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews control the government. That conspiracy theory is old and has led to violent persecution of Jews around the world. Hence why it was called out.

Did you read the article? He referred to AIPAC and Pro-Israel America, not some Israeli lobbying group. AIPAC is an American lobbying group famously started and run by American Jews. It’s not an Israeli group unless you think Jews aren’t really American? (That would put you in the Christian nationalist camp with Marjorie Taylor Greene.) Pro-Israel America is a recent spin off of AIPAC started by people (Jewish Americans) who were previously in AIPAC leadership positions.

I’m not a fan of AIPAC (the progressive group J Street much better represents mine and other liberal Jewish American viewpoints) but the canard that Jews control the government is an old and vile one that has led to persecution of Jews. And it shouldn’t be invoked by anyone.
That’s a ton of people, and these people will move to lower income jobs and will make the fight for living wages more difficult; because they will be more willing to take federal minimum or less than what Americans see as a living wage.
Dems are pushed by corporations to push for immigration policies like this, so that the labor pool becomes flooded with people very hap my to accept the federal min wage and that makes the bite out of workiing class Americans ability to fight for living wages.

Also just so you’re aware, corporations pay dems to push immigrations because they are more likely to accept the federal minimum wage And that makes it significantly more difficult for working class Americans to fight for living wages.

The Texas and Florida democratic parties are a joke . Florida to this day I don’t believe even has a chair. In Texas the national DNC was no help while the GOP raked in millions from outside funds . Here in Texas we ran Beto knowing he wouldn’t win the swing vote due to his gun comments had a failed senate run and a worse presidential run , a AG no one knew , and a Lt gov that already lost twice before . First thing would be to run quality candidates which we haven’t had in Texas for many years. Democrats do very little state wide to get elected , poll closures in areas where democrats are more prone to vote didn’t help either as well as added voter restrictions . To this day there’s really no democrats in Texas with state name recognition. To even remotely be able to challenge the GOP. It goes a lot farther than the people of Texas want to be ruled by Republicans .

A la GOP supermajority in Missouri overruling voters approving independent redistricting for actual competitive races? Like Missouri making it now harder for voter ballot initiatives? I hate the blatant disregard for voter rights and will in Missouri. It is a sign of weakness in your own platform to limit voter’s say in the outcome of elections.
Our advantage is our judiciary absolutely loathing far-right-wing vandalism. Hell, Alexandre de Moraes was the one who ejected the Governor, Lula had just suspended his authority over the state policy until day 31 and transfered it to himself, and wanted explanations. 2 soft 4 me.
The business plot was a relatively well organized top down conspiracy with real money and leadership behind it which failed because the plotters didn't realize that Smedley Butler, the renowned General they picked to lead the charge had recently been radicalized in the opposite direction after several meetings with homeless WWI veterans and ratted them out. This siege in Brazil is just a repeat of an attempt that already failed in the US. They even had their own version of the Q shaman. What's the Marx quote, 'history repeats, first as tragedy, then as farce.'.

After the governor sabotaged his own Police, president Lula declared a federal intervention on the Federal District's security force, which makes them answer directly to the Federal Government until the end of the month. After that, reinforcements were called and the terrorists were boxed in, both in Congress grounds and in their camp near the Army headquarter where they were begging for a military coup. Under the command of Lula, the police and military started dismantling the camps and detaining the rioters.

I do believe that regardless of how many crimes committed as a woman it does scare me to be attacked during my runs at 5:00 am. I was along the FDR the samee time and day, the day before the woman who got attacked last week. I could’ve been running that very next day and that could of been me getting attacked. Or any woman running that path. So that is a little terrifying. I generally have always felt safe in Manhattan but this is coming from someone who commutes and does not live in Manhattan. I live close to the city. I think that they are trying to push a narrative to scare people. But still do think some of those crimes are concerning. Plus the amount of people pushed on trains. I do think crime is a little crazy this year. But is that a society issue? Like I doubt crime would stop if Zeldin was governor honestly.

Interesting. Herkimer and Oneida both seem like exact opposites where Zeldin often visits and Hochul doesn't even pretend exists. Just shows how each candidate prioritizes different areas.
This is exactly it, maybe even further than you've taken it. Medvedev isn't really anyone anymore. He's in every way that matters a clown and a scarecrow, there to play to the extremes and make Putin look more moderate. He has no real power or influence and I'm being driven mad by the amount of journalists reporting the things he says as if he's a spokesdeer for the Kremlin. He's best seen as almost a version of Solovyov who draws some perceived legitimacy from the state.
Really? Most of the russian/soviet emigrants I've seen have been more than happy that they've left. Getting a letter from the government that "you're not wanted back" instead of "we need you to go be cannon fodder" seems to be prefreable.

"America. Love it or leave it". This is their Vietnam War. The war protesters were right and the warmongering right wing was wrong. Same thing now in Russia. Better to leave now and not go back. Horrors await those who stay.

You're basically summarizing the russian mentality. "As long as it doesn't affect me, they can do whatever".
So you're saying it's cheaper/better to just let the Russian missiles just hit Ukrainian cities? Yeah, half a building plus a dozen human beings are definitely worth less than $50k.
A single Iron Dome interceptor costs $50k. A single AIM-9X costs $500k. So to intercept 20 missiles, Iron Dome would cost $1 million. The AIM-9X would cost $10 million.

Interceptors are valuable. Ukrainian lives are more valuable. And all those Russia rockets will sooner or later be fired into one or into the other.

Exactly. Any nation threatened by russia has an opportunity to severely hinder or even destroy their ability to wage war, for a fraction of what it would normally cost. This is a bargain for any country in europe and it’s foolish to think it’s not worth the cost.

Operational tests are commonplace. In fact, there's hardly any exercise that does not involve some form of operational test. Even the Patriots and THAADs are operationally tested from time to time, despite their age. That's called spiral development.
What puzzles me is the utter lack of mainstream reporting of the missing $30billion disater tax, the recorded comments of Erdogan praising his efforts to bypass building regs for earthquake resistant buildings. Its already yesturday's news.
Turkey has no enforcement of building laws, rampant corruption at every level of supply chain and government, a weird old law that says you don’t need planning permission for any building that is built in one day that has a roof on by midnight (or something), idiotic unskilled construction workers, and where everyone has given up on asking for things to be fixed under a mad tyranny.

Yea. It's the governments fault, but the blatantly wannabe Russia style authoritarian kleptocratic system Erdogan is trying to build won elections and reelection without faking the results and with minimal protest. Yes, obviously there were crackdowns at attempted protests. But after the Maidan movement my expectations for what people can accomplish if they really want to remove their thieving, authoritarian, piece of trash rulers are a little higher, especially when that country is part of Western alliances that protect it from the outside.

Hi Bozzooo. Your submission from reuters.com is behind a registration wall. A registration wall limits the number of free articles users can access before they are required to register an account to log in to continue reading it. While your submission was not removed, users are discouraged from upvoting it or commenting on it.
But what is implied by your posts is there is something wrong for a Black woman to achieve prestigious positions like District Attorney of one of America’s great cities, or getting elected Attorney General of America’s largest state. Reading people like you, who ignore the complexities of the job and reduce it to “she sent ns to jail for weed” without giving any deets or actually providing any contextual info on it. Not even explaining if you mean her tenure as AG where she wouldn’t deal with local marijuana cases, or her tenure as a DA where she ran the office that would be was in a city where the population wasn’t all that black (it’s not like she was DA in Oakland).
How do you know? This is just more bullshitting from you. Do you ever state anything factual or do you lie about everything?

Stop lying about verifiable facts. Plenty of black people act like republicans, claiming kamala can't be bad for black rights is an obvious lie. She can and is. No one is going to claim clarence thomas is a supporter of black rights just because he is black. He happily threw out major voting regulations that preserved the rights of minorities.
So now Ford is at the top of the list of brands I'll never ever ever buy again. Followed closely by Apple.
Trains make plenty of sense, the infrastructure is cheaper to maintain, there's effectively no chance of traffic jams, the drivers are professionals rather than some jackass with a license, and the electric power has multiple benefits like not carrying its own fuel ( for why that's dumb), lower pollution, less noise, better acceleration, regenerative braking, and the ability to do stuff like put a stationary battery system at the bottom of a hill to even out system load at high-power inclines, all at a fraction of the cost of the auto industry, a fraction of the physical size of the interstate system, a fraction of the fuel costs to do all this transportation, and a fraction of the cost to maintain.

Exactly. And even Waymo is restricted to some suburbs in the southwest where it hardly ever snows and rains. They also are geofenced to areas where they Waymo crews manually heavily scan everything so there's a pre-existing high-quality map of the environment. There's also a team of people who can remotely step in at a moment's notice to take control over the vehicle, and rescue teams that travel out to pick any one up from a malfunctioning vehicle.
"In September, the Khartoum Arab Summit resolved that there would be "no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel". However, as Avraham Sela notes, the Khartoum conference effectively marked a shift in the perception of the conflict by the Arab states away from one centered on the question of Israel's legitimacy, toward one focusing on territories and boundaries. This was shown on 22 November when Egypt and Jordan accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.".
Palestinians are so overwhelmingly outgunned militarily. There is no chance any armed resistance will do anything but push Israelis further from the negotiating table and justify calls for greater security and control over areas of the West Bank. Palestinians should accept that they lost the war of 1967 and take whatever state that can get while it is still an option.
Sorry but Mueller did not do his job. If anything all he did was reinforce the ridiculousness of the Republican Party. Given that the justice department operates independent of influence of the president, it also shouldn’t have mattered who was president. He uncovered a crime and chose to uphold a crooked justice department standard of not charging a sitting president while ignoring all the other justice department standards that hurt trump. If we knew what mueller knew I have a feeling some of us might be obligated out of sense of duty to mankind to tell the world just how bad things were to prevent more chaos. He didn’t. Trump went on to stay in power and lead the initial reponse to Covid-19. Hundreds of thousands of people died because of his incompetence and evil and in my opinion that blood is on the hands of all trumps enablers and those who were too much of a coward to stop it.

... factual foundation? Trump sent a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol on live TV The factual foundation of a need for a serious investigation by a non political entity isn't in question.

Thank you. I'm so tired of reading about how smart and meticulous these people are when all they've really done is pass around the responsibility of holding Trump accountable.
I am sure said review will be done in an impartial way and absolutely not used for partisan purposes. /s.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says Congress will need to investigate the president following the discovery of classified documents at his former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washinon and a second batch at his home in Delaware. He also criticizes the Justice Department over how it handled the matter compared with the the FBI's search of former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and he criticizes the failure to disclose the discovery to the public before the election.

Ya know what? We should probably search the homes/offices of every former President and Vice President. Cause who knows how many classified documents have been taken out and "forgotten" about by other previous holders of the offices. Though I get the feeling a certain VP who served from 2001 to 2009 is going to have the most stashed away somewhere.

A little tangent, but it's ridiculous how people don't understand why Trump supporters went for him to this day. Pollsters were always confused because the reasons for supporting Trump changed constantly depending on whatever Trump ranted about recently. It was never about any specific policy goals, it was purely authoritarianism and them wanting to alleviate their overwhelming anxiety because they never developed healthy coping strategies growing up. Democrats could take advantage of this and use more populist rhetoric and it would actually be true unlike Republican's who lie about making things better for the average American. It's why Bernie Sanders was liked by many Trump supporters, he filled the same role but with actual beneficial policy positions.
Unpossible. McConnell is like a shark in the ocean. I have a healthy respect for a strong murderer when it’s in its environment.

The House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday voted 24-16 to release former president Donald Trump’s tax returns to the public, capping a protracted legal and political battle that began when Trump was in the Oval Office.
Democrats have for more than three years pushed to make Trump’s tax returns public, and the documents were at last made available to the Ways and Means Committee late last month after the Supreme Court denied a last attempt by Trump to withhold the records.

Trump — who broke with a decades-long tradition of presidential candidates and presidents by refusing to make his tax returns public — has for years falsely claimed that he could not release them while under “routine audit” by the Internal Revenue Service.

Those revelations followed reporting by The Washinon Post and other organizations that showed Trump had paid little or no federal income taxes in the earlier years of his career. The Post wrote in its biography, “Trump Revealed,” that Trump paid no income taxes in 1978 and 1979, using tax deductions such as real estate depreciation that enabled him to claim a negative income of $3.8 million.

At the time, a Trump spokesman disputed the accuracy of the Times report and said Trump had paid tens of millions of dollars in “personal taxes” to the federal government, a vague phrase that left unclear what taxes were paid. The records obtained by the Times showed that Trump had reduced his taxes by aggressively using losses to offset income, among other methods.

We should probably rehabilitate the use of the word to what it means, if we want to understand anything at all. Its been thrown around like a used towel.
It's a stupid ironic Mexican joke, "Putin" is a slang way of saying "Puto" wich is derogatory term used to call friends or other people, it's original use was directed to gay people "that guy is a puto(gay)", but like I said, nowadays friends use it between themselves in a friendly manner, like: "Que onda puto" (what's up puto), it's part of our lenguage and pretty sure it's used all over Latin America as well.

No. It isn't. As much as I dislike the core recognisable tenets of ultra-traditional and reactionary movements (like fascism was), it pertains to paradoxically individualistic messianic cults, and is by definition anti-establishment. If there's any one redeeming feature from early fascism it's actually the revolutionary stance it takes against the establishment, and even the persecution it perpetuates.

This is sad. My oldest son is gay. I knew when he was 5. He came out to me at 15. I just laughed and said no shit. People are attracted to their who attracted. Get the fuck over it.

Literally the only people she would ever respond to that weren't me (and occasionally her father) met one of those two descriptions (my daughter struggles with anxiety and selective mutism as well). I'm not sure what conclusion you would draw from this behaviour apart from 'Evidently, she has a type'. As I said, it was extremely weird, but it did make me understand how parents of gay children sometimes know from a very young age.
I used to be a professional musician, playing drums and singing in R&B/Variety cover bands. FWIW, I was the only white guy in the band for most of that time. The first time I went to a particular friend's house during an off-day in Oregon, her four pugs ganged up on me, and just covered me in pug hair and drool. And when I got back to the bandhouse, one of the band's singers saw me walk in and said "Boy, you look like you just got freaky with a Bigfoot!".
If you want to learn more, I highly recommend season 3 of the Blowback podcast, they do a deep dive into every part of it and have some neat extra episodes like North Korea cinema where they interview this Australian woman who did a documentary on it and Kim Jong Ils film obsession and his book.

Probably for redundancy. Imagine being the audio technician for this speech and only propping up one mic. Suddenly, that mic/cable/input fails and the big announcement wasn’t properly recorded.
Typically, federal agency leaders will testify before the appropriations committees about their projects and priorities at the beginning of each year’s budget process. Once a lawmaker introduces an amendment to an appropriations bill on the House floor, though, the affected agency cannot officially come before Congress to respond to the amendment.
It’s a rule that the House last reinstated back in 2018, and although none of the proposed changes at the time actually went through, lawmakers did offer a couple of amendments related to the provision.
It’s a rule that the House last reinstated back in 2018, and although none of the proposed changes at the time actually went through, lawmakers did offer a couple of amendments related to the provision.
House Republicans recommended reinstating the “Holman rule,” a provision that lets lawmakers offer amendments that would make changes to federal agency and personnel functions during the appropriations process. Those changes can include, notably, reductions to federal employees’ salaries, as well as reductions to staffing numbers at agencies.

Here's the interesting part; Norway at the time had declared themselves neutral after WW1, and had built down their armed forces to a very very reduced neutrality guard. And those 2 months? Thats longer....A LOT longer than any country had resisted the German invasions at the time. It took longer to occupy Norway than it did to occupy Poland and France. Both fairly large military forces at the time. There's also a discepancy in loss numbers. The Germans notoriously underreported losses. My own grandmother comes from a small rural township, where the history books reports from the German's own loss reports; 7 casualties. In reality the Norwegians made a local stand there and was fighting house to house, forcing the Germans to burn them out. And the locals observed the germans taking casualties in the high 2-digits, then throwing their own casualties into remaining houses and lighting them up. Her brother was commandeered by the Germans to drive his truck with casualties to the fires. He made at least 4 runs with the back of his truck stacked to the roof with dead soldiers.
Absolutely true. Back when Eve wasn't a shit game (there was a time, it was just a very long time ago), I went to fanfest one year in Iceland. (Hell of an experience, I honestly cannot think of a place I'd rather go back to).
We need to blame those who create negative environments. We already know that when in a tight spot morals are one of the easier things to shed for human beings, that is something we know and should account for as much as possible. We just haven’t found a way to change human nature at its core yet.
>BBC concluded that although citizens of national republics (such as Dagestan, Buryatia, Altai, and Bashkortostan) are sent to the front and die in combat at higher rates than citizens of ethnically Russian regions, in absolute terms, ethnic Russians comprise the majority of Russian military deaths, and their proportion of the military dead is approximately equal to their proportion in the overall Russian population.[12] BBC concluded that this finding suggests that discrepancies in Russian force generation efforts therefore fall along regional and territorial lines as opposed to predominantly ethnic lines and noted that military service is seen as the only lifeline in regions on Russia‘s economic periphery where social mobility is greatly restrained.
China is no way near ready for an invasion. China has emptied its strategic national food reserve (pork) due to covid and without that, its people would starve during an embargo in just 2 months. People don't understand the amount of food China imports from USA, South America, Australia and Africa just to feed their own people. They also have not finished building their navy fleet. Their drone fleet though will probably soon go into mass production. The reason China is making headlines is to distract from their own covid problems. They are facing a 2019 like shutdown for the whole nation around new year. So those jets are just a distraction, for now.
If China could manage to incentivize Taiwan economically further (combined with Hong Kong, they receive \40% of Taiwan's exports currently which is about the same as UK's exports to EU) slowly vassalizing it without using military force could be a peaceful end goal that doesn't involve risking China's stability and global economy. Of course Taiwanese citizens aren't that easy, thankfully.
What does a job have to do with anything? We simply don't know what goes on in that household other than a poor girl resorted to this. Anyone can be abused, this lady has a husband that doesn't care when others attack his wife's appearance, that says a lot. Something is going on in that home that is not right.

Poor child. Imagine being bisexual and not only is your parent, who's supposed to accept and protect you, unsupportive of your life, but he's actively supporting people that want to take away your rights and maybe even your life. What are the odds certain members of the right blame this on her sexuality and not her toxic father? I hope she'll be alright and can get far away from the garbage that 'raised' her.

So unless you're strapping up your boots rn and are ready to march over there this second with a rifle in hand; don't be bitching 'the US isn't doing enough'. I don't know what possibly more people (more specifically their citizens) could want at the moment unless they're suggesting outright WW3 which we should all be trying to avoid.
Exactly. It's the long game that matters. Putin signed legislation to protect ex-presidents from prosecution in Russia, but post-Putin Russian leadership can still send him and other war criminals to the Hague if that gets some sanctions lifted.

No. No one wants that. This is like the worst IRL Trolley Problem, but 100k+ people have already died. Putin is unpredictable though. No one knows what to do.

Isolate him politically and impoverish his main supporters. Bankrupt his country. Fund dissenters and revolutionaries in his regime. Fund and arm Russia's enemies. Cut Russia off from major world institutions. Help other countries to stop relying on Russian fossil fuels.
They began getting them at the end of October, but I agree, they're not really comparable. The 600 (+/- $10k; hard to find) is cheaper than a Shahed 136 ($20k; accounts differ and range up to 53000€), but meant more as an Anti-tank/-armor weapon à la javelin ($78k). The 300 is anti-personnel mostly and cost $6k. Yet the Shahed outperforms in range (est 1800-2500km) hands down, which is clearly a problem. The 300 is 10km, and the 600 is 40km with 50km of loitering time.
The only western tanks which have a realistic chance to actually make an impact and have proper logistics are the Leopard and the Abrams but even the Leopard is going to be a challenge considering the number of variants and while there are a big number overall available, they are spread throughout many countries and thus limiting the amount that can be given away, not to mention that while many countries use the Leopard, it's not like these countries can actually produce them or provide more parts.

There are to an extent. The US gave UA some switchblade drones. There are two variants, the switchblade 300 and 600. They are not nearly as long range as the iranian shaheds, but they are smaller and more portable and thus more tactical.

Sure. Parents wouldn't like it, so let the parents deal with it. "Your kid can't get AP credit and reduce the cost of college because a politician thinks he gets to dictate curriculum on a topic he doesn't understand for the entire country. Sorry, take it up with him.".

The modern "conservatives"...aren't. They don't want to conserve anything. They want to regress to a time that never existed and remake the country into a Christian, nationalist nation. They're fine with big government as long as its in service of their culture war issues. No problems with big brother snooping in our bedrooms as long as its set against LGBT families. Government telling schools what to teach? Sure, as long as you don't teach Timmy that some folks don't believe in Jesus or that some families have 2 dads or moms.

College Board is another American institution that is completely unprepared for the modern conservative movement's disingenuousness. If it takes you a fucking month to address Republican lies, you've already lost.
If there were a poll I think 90% share your opinion. I sure do. The problem is not that you don't have a choice, it's that by the time you want to, you no longer have the capacity to make the decision. I should be able to put a trigger in place; once certain criteria is met, I get the shot or a pill in my coffee. I want everything to go to my children.
u/platz604 is right about mental illness being a social construct (what separates mental illness from a natural response to circumstances is not delineated by any empirical evidence in most cases; it is just arbitrary). The suffering is very real, but there's no evidence, in most cases, that the cause of it is medical (although genetic issues can predispose people to being more vulnerable to environmental causes of mental suffering). But they're wrong in saying that the solution is to deprive the soi-disant mentally ill of their right to bodily autonomy. They're wrong to say that it's those who are victims who should be forced to pay the price of society's failings.
These headlines drive me crazy. Republicans will NEVER admit they were wrong. They will lie deflect gaslight and eventually win over the stupid people. We have a name for that type of society. It’s called communist. The Republican Party is a communist cult. If we just labeled republicans communists you would understand everything about them. From their attack on gay rights to their worship of elites to their love of cult daddy. We wouldn’t have to get their opinion on anything because it will always be the opposite of what a liberal would want. What a liberal what’s is what’s best for the country. So republicans want the opposite of that. Liberals want a democracy. Republicans go the other direction and go full commie Russia style. Liberals refuse to call them communists. They call us commies for wanting affordable healthcare and the wealthy to pay taxes and they win and we lose. Call them commies.

I highly doubt Putin would make a nuclear strike, I think he values his life more since any nuclear strike would most certainly have an attack from NATO and if Russia in Ukraine is anything to go off of I give Russia a month maybe two against NATO if they've lucky, clearly the only real power they have because of the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine which means any strike will be met with another and another until the worlds dead.

Yup. Most House Democrats and the overwhelming majority of California House Democrats voted against the Iraq War including Pelosi, Barbara Lee, and Maxine Waters. Another reason to dislike Schiff.

Absolutely not. Some people take certain drugs for some specific side effects and not for the main purpose of the drug.

Completely disagree. Go read Schiff's book. He's one of the few truly honest dedicated public servants we have right now at senior level. Porter is great but Schiff deserves to be a Senator at this point for all he's done. Plus it's time to give them back some of their "owning the libs". Nothing would piss them off more than a Senator Schiff.

That's... Not a lot. It's like three years of Washinon States revenues - on only Cannabis. It's like 2% of Texas annual real estate tax revenue. 0.5% of California's annual budget. Approximately 123 milliseconds of federal spending.

I have yet to see. Republican Governor hold a Press Conference outlawing Abortion and then explaining how their state is going to increase funding and visibility as well as repair their broken and Ill funded social service programs like the foster care system.

Wow. Made me look. That would be $1.6 Billion. 1/1000th as much as $1.6 Trillion. $230 per person in Tennessee.

This whole war, Russia has consistently failed at reacting tactically to intelligence... or even to manifest reality. "This changes nothing" is the Russian motto.
Exactly. During the Great Wrath (1713-1721) Russia killed, tortured and took as slaves a significant portion of the Finnish population. Talking about tens of thousands of victims in a population of 300 000 - 400 000 people. Can't choose your neighbours I guess. Russia has always been a cunt.

EDIT: I forgot to mention a critical aspect of this that is forgotten but important about an authoritarian state: everything is centrally managed, from the top-down, everybody is to follow orders strictly and completely, nobody who is not trusted by the dictator's chain of command is to have any independent authority or autonomy, everything must depend on the system, everyone with any authority must be part of the dictator-approved hierarchy to prevent rebellion.

Yes, thank you! I was trying to remember where I saw this. Such an excellent video. It's an hour long so cozy up with a coffee or hot cocoa but it's worth it.

Throughout December, NATO & Ukraine have been unofficially negotiating with Russia. I think the US, even the French, were shocked at how that went. There is a lot more consensus now about this war ending in a forced retreat. As soon as certain things were said by Mr. Peskov, Brads & (probably) Leopard 2s got green lights.
Mainly politics, I suspect. My brother used to work at a northern radar base a long time ago and was telling me that foreign jets routinely enter Canadian air space to test if we're watching. They were usually escorted out without fuss, but not in such a predictable pattern that whey would know exactly when they had been detected. Sometimes, Canada would do the same to Russia. The general public isn't aware of all the little dances done by the air force of every country. Recently though, a particular balloon dance has been widely publicized and everybody want to hear what's happening and what our officials are doing. For political reasons then, it's important to demonstrate air power by shooting stuff down, to reassure people that we can do it if necessary. It's not usually deemed necessary.
Exactly. Hell if they have achieved interstellar travel, then they would easily have the tech to easily remain hidden from us. We'd have a) no idea they were watching us and b) they could annihilate us at any time, at the drop of a hat, if they so wished.
So you’re in favor of companies going beyond overboard with censorship? Because there only two possible outcomes with section 230 being removed: either absolutely no censorship, since section 230 stipulates companies must attempt in good faith to remove unfavorable let alone all unlawful content, and the consequences of such an approach to the internet, or the worst of the outcomes, which is censorship many times worse than what people complain about now in an attempt to stifle any possible legal complaints against companies. And yes companies who only care about their bottom line will go to places we cannot imagine to protect their bottom line. Everyone will be affected negatively from the demise of section 230: from liberals to conservatives, from pro worker to pro corporations, from minority advocates to traditionalists, to anyone who even posts one thing that can be taken as “controversial” by the person receiving such content regardless of the intent behind a post. Frivolous lawsuits will rise with the ruling against section 230, since America is the land where theoretically anyone can sue for pretty much anything. The internet as we know and love may likely die if section 230 goes away.

Yep, although both perspectives can be true at the same time. It’s in the US’s interest for Ukraine to survive as Russia’s punching bag for quite a while. Between sanctions and the gradual depletion of their military might, the longer this drags on, the worse it is for Russia (and better for the west). A swift and decisive victory for either side undermines this objective, although ultimately a victory for Ukraine against a heavily depleted Russia would be the best strategic outcome. This could take some time to play out.
However, thanks to Western training and materiel support and Russian corruption and incompetence, AFU units are qualitatively superior to their Russian counterparts. As the Ukrainians themselves readily admit, they're lucky that the opposition is so goddamned stupid; this stupidity has largely neutralized any potential advantage that the Russians had. The Russians have also pissed away materiel that they can't afford to waste on civilian targets for very little gain; the Ukrainians are very much aware that this is a war for survival, and if rolling blackouts are the price to pay for survival they'll gladly pay it.
They are, but the good news is that each day more and more of the old, uber-conservative Arizonans continue dying, and more and more of the younger, less conservative Arizonans reach voting age. I haven't seen figures, but anecdotally I've heard a lot of conservative Californians have been moving to Arizona, Nevada, Texas and Utah, and while not "progressive" by any means, "California Conservatives" tend to be a lot more moderate than conservatives elsewhere.
132 is bullshit. No Ballot measures with a tax increase to pay thing like schools, fire departments, libraries and police to name a few will ever get passed again. While single issue sounds nice it’s going to complicate things more than fix them. The writers of the bills got what they wanted. Minority rule.

The defence review is currently being redrafted in the wake of the Ukraine invasion but I think it would be extremely foolish to pull back from “East of Suez” once again and have all that effort be for nothing. Either way, post-Brexit, there is a strong impetus to forge stronger alliances with nations in the region. This has come in the form of Japanese and Australian Free Trade Agreements, AUKUS and the Tempest project but also the UK’s application to join the CPTPP Pacific trading bloc. Interesting times ahead for sure.
The UK was one of just a few European nations to actually actively train Ukrainian soldiers after the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, no other major European nation provided training, this was provided right up until the 2022 invasion where it was then scaled up further and moved to the United Kingdom, it also was one of the first countries to deploy massive amounts of defensive weaponry to Ukraine, choosing to do so before the war began so Ukraine could train and then forward deploy it.

Yea, and I mean for what it’s worth, I am optimistic for the future. Just not the near future lol but maybe like 20-30 years down the line when the U.S has split up into several different countries one of those countries will figure out how to do things better. But who knows.
I’m not sure you know what that means. They’re escalating the culture wars by expanding and simplifying their propaganda; pushing for book bannings and library shut downs; planning widespread violence; and amplifying their attacks on the LGBTQ community. And the only meaningful pushback they’ve actually gotten legislatively is a very bare bones gay marriage bill that does basically nothing to actually protect it. Otherwise, the other pushback they’re getting is nothing more than empty platitudes and moral high-grounding from weak and corrupt Democratic politicians. And the liberals and centrists in this country aren’t willing to actually do anything about this besides throw a transrights out on Twitter.

Obama here is just a commonly known example of Western (very loose definition here, i know) politician, nothing to do with Obama himself. An external scapegoat, basically.
They still do. It is a shadow of former self, but Russia still hosts talented people I admire. I stopped reading anything Russian because I don’t want to give money to this regime, used to buy tons of ebooks from their online stores. This war sucks on so many levels.

Before they invaded Ukraine they were spreading the propaganda that Nazi Ukraine was killing Russians and Russian culture (true, there are extremism and corruption in Ukraine - but if this could be considered a valid excuse to attack a country, Russia would have been eliminated a long time ago), Ukraine is an artificial state etc.

I agree. I spent my college years studying Russian language, history and literature. And as a listener of classical music, am enamored with some if it’s composers. And I believe that iconography is a beautiful sacred art form. Even some of its architecture is a fascinating study.
Like most things excreted from Patrick's multiple orifices, this is at most sound and fury signifying nothing. Apologies to Shakespeare for using his words in relation to this fine specimen of Texas thought. OTOH, the preceding phrase is exquisitely apt for Patrick.
between making it harder for everyone to vote and then the threat of having to go to the pols 2,3,4,8 times before an election is settles seems designed to do 2 things, ensure they get the outcome they want and it kills most people's desire to vote, this seems like the right wing end game of the last 50 years; tell people gov doesn't work, prove it when they elect you, make them question the validity of elections, make them redo a few, watch voter participation drop to single digital.

I've skimmed it. Especially striking was the proposal for an electoral college for statewide offices. Methinks the solons who came up with that plank either didn't consider that Reynolds v Sims would apply to such a body or (more likely?) they have no clue that SCOTUS decision is on the books. That is, Loving and Harris counties wouldn't have one elector each.

Why not? He is just like the rest of the Republicans, only a little more overt about it. The leadership of the Republican Party actively fund-raised for him. Now that he has been found out, they want to distance themselves, even though they are 100% responsible for him. They should own it.
Following accusations that he lied about much of his resumé and facing long list of legal issues, Santos has now been slammed by his fellow Republicans in Congress as a “bad guy” and an “imposter,” and in one case, he’s been compared to a character from Fatal Attraction.

This is all fine. People like Santos would never reach a breaking point, even after day after day of being called out for lies, scorned by his colleagues and made a mockery of on a nightly basis. I'm sure he will remain the stable individual he has always been, and there's just no way there will ever be a situation involving him where people question the wisdom of removing the magnetometers from Congress. /s.

There’s a pretty good argument to be made that it’s already covered by laws against religious discrimination, since the caste system itself is tied to religion; you can’t discriminate against someone based on caste without their religion (or perceived religion) being a factor in the discrimination.
What should I do, exactly? Should I have to bring it up every time I speak? what do you want exactly? There is always the possibility that some other communities will have greater privileges than yours, and you may have to deal with prejudice there, which is something that happens more frequently. Where will this downward spiral eventually lead? Because there are more hierarchical structures than humans could possibly enumerate, discrimination between humans does not always result from community status, despite the fact that it is frequently the main factor. And based on the way you are speaking, I don't believe you want to stop this obscene tradition. You want other people to express regret for crimes they didn't even commit. You are getting a subconscious pleasure that somehow you are fighting for the casteism atrocities but in the mean while I think you are damaging more than anyone else you are more casteist than an average Brahmin.

Oh I agree. Critical thinking needs to make a comeback in a big way. I'd just prefer that people ignored polls entirely and actually paid attention to the candidates and their positions(important edit: AND THEN VOTED), but at this point I feel like that's 'old man yelling at clouds' territory.

Okay. There’s lots of dirt on her. Her restaurant, Shooter’s Grill, has been effectively closed down for a long while, to include catering to a rodeo event and everyone violently shitting themselves and even getting hospitalized, among numerous other health violations. And then you have her husband exposing himself to teenage girls at a bowling alley. Which, with that, one would go, “yeah, that’s grooming.”.

The Baltics and the Polish essentially get a an excuse to let their equipment be used against the Russian army as it was originally intended, the bonus for them not a single Lithuanian or Polish soldier is put in harms way by doing this unless they've willingly signed up for one of the Ukrainian foreign legions.

It's ok. There will just be yet another instance of cops beating a black man to death, or holding a back man in a choke lock until he suffocates, or shooting a black man for seemingly no reason. Maybe some cop will really go out on a limb and shoot a black woman instead. And everyone will spout more platitudes about how awful it is, and how it can't be a allowed to happen again. And then it'll fade from the news a few weeks later, without any real policy change in the police department in question (let alone any legislation). The cops involved might be prosecuted, but maybe not, but they'll be out free for months or years before the trail concludes. And short of the most egregious activity possible being caught from a clear camera angle, they'll probably get off scot free.

If voters kept the house for the Dems and elected a few more democratic senators in places like Ohio, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, we'd probably get not just permanent ACA subsidy expansions (which among other things cover the middle/upper class folks who have sudden very costly emergencies) but also a pseudo Medicaid expansion nationally via ACA subsidies (thus covering the poor in states that refused to expand Medicaid). As well as potentially a public option (lowering costs somewhat), more drug reforms (lowering costs somewhat), and increasing government medical residencies (lowering doctor pay somewhat via supply and demand but also increasing supply of doctors and helping various areas that have doctor shortages).

I agree. I was pointing out the part with all unions where they protect union members that are grossly bad employees. Every union you mentioned have examples of members that are still employed after overwhelming evidence shows fire-able offenses while the case goes through the system for months or sometimes years all while still getting paid even though they're no longer performing their duties.

Well said. There's an active push for a new Constitutional Convention. Philosophically, I agree with Jefferson in that it should be rewritten at regular intervals to keep up with the times. And it's long overdue. But do I want that to happen in a corporate-driven, dark-money superPAC, Citizen's United environment? Do I want MTG or Rick Scott or the Koch organization involved in the process?

Primarily liberal and 80% of the crazies who want to shoot the post office worker delivering your tax returns are Conservatives so the military has, as a whole, been waiting for an excuse to shoot at dangers to the country like these people for decades. and 2. Much better trained and supplied than a group of guerilla rednecks with moonshine bombs and civilian model AR-15s because that's what everyone thinks is cool since they're named most often (they're not the best guns by far) and in addition to that, your wife or neighbor would report you and your gun club in a second because that's what a normal, non-crazy, American would do. Research "The red scare" or the japanese internment camps. Americans LOVE selling out other Americans.

What you're really asking though, I assume, is: is this ready to start developing for market? The answer is unfortunately no, not yet, but we're much closer. Think of it like "we're not there yet, but we can see the finish line clearly now." No fusion tomorrow, but also no more "fusion is always 20 years away.".
We can now focus on the other issues of creating those conditions, more efficient lasers, containment systems, industrial systems for energy generation at scale. Most critically, the existence of this verified result potentially encourages further and larger levels of investment into the space, and potentially makes the idea of a profitable fusion industry a possibility.

That’s not what you said. This is just not a fusion power plant. It is a fusion reactor however. The canned response to any piece of fusion research ignores all the developments in the field.

Any headlines that say this is a breakthrough that will lead to fusion energy are ill-informed, as the process here has no scalability. This is absolutely a milestone however, and one that will be listed in the history of fusion power.
I am really curious to know why he was arrested by Russian border police after just going from Poland to Kaliningrad on a vacation and then held for the majority of a year there. What was his crime?
The whole region was depopulated of native Germans at the end of WW2, and only somewhat replaced with Russians (and other soviet nationalities) during the following decades. It’s still largely empty.

So the article that has business in getting clicks and manipulating the data to create more clicks is telling you one side of the story without telling you information about something critical to the article itself ? all most like its shifting the narrative to for some weird reason ?

The non-profit foundations (Richardson, Menzies, James Foley Foundation) simply took up the legal negotiations with the Russian judiciary/government on behalf of the family. They didn't "negotiate" his release like some are implying but rather just did the legal requires to get him released when Russia said his time was up. He committed a crime, did time, and was released after 9 months.
Why would India deliver weapons to Russia? India was never going to go against Russia since 70% of our army is dependant on them and we have 2 neighbours with whom we don't have the best of relations, add the fact that it has been Russia who has helped with their veto on many matters. If you think this is something new, it has always been our position aka let's try and accommodate them, you are talking about Ukraine war indian trade with Pakistan only stopped when Pakistan stopped it (post removal of 370) and this is a country which had killed many of our citizens and despite what many fans of our current government might think even after pathankot we were trading.

TY. Makes total sense. And agreed, one cannot use reasonable and rational explanations when dealing with those who are illogical or irrational. And my next question was exactly where you went--could logic be applied as such legally in court toward motive and intent. I understand a little better now. I should know better, too. This is the same fatigue I felt trying to be rational with a narcissist from years ago before the terminology became commonplace. Cheers.
In this case, if this testimony were offered in a criminal trial, it would depend on a number of factors: who the defendant is, what is it being offered for, is the declarant available or not for testimony. There's a lot here to unpack.

Seeking brighter more logical minds than mine and those who know the correct terminology (inference, deductive reasoning, etc) When the statement "the election was stolen" is uttered isn't the logical sequence something like, it was mine, it was stolen from me, therefore I lost the election and I want it back. His false public statements about being stolen are based on his agreeing that the election was lost. Is that inferred or deducted or whatever the correct words are.

With a light amount of googling, you can hear recorded calls of Russian soldiers in Ukraine & their wives back home, with the wives encouraging their husbands to go out raping Ukrainian women. Even when the men share how awful the fighting is, and how they don’t want to be there, their families dgaf. So much evidence of torture and raping of children by Russian soldiers. Russians were horrendous to the people they “liberated” at the end of WWII. I know these examples all involve military but it’s consistent over time & this behavior is done by soldiers freshly recruited from civilian life. It’s not just their government, it’s the culture of a broad swath of their population, I’m sorry to say.
They aren’t particularly civilized. They are raised with a strong man approach without humility and self-perception. It’s very visible throughout Europe how they handle the situation of struggling in the war (hint: not well). They are going to have to change, they really do and it’s going to be hard but I will be the first person who applaud the people who do.

Exactly! It’s not like the wealthy won’t still get everyone else’s money, but the difference is the lower and middle classes will at least get goods and services in exchange for their money.
Now, this may be just where we live (Queensland), so grain of salt and all that, but the culture here goes to bed earlier. Like restaurants are open 'late' means 9pm. Translation: they're pushing u out the door and locking up at 8.30pm. But...most blue collar jobs here start around 5-6am, and are done by 2pm, but they're also in bed by 8pm. Because of Queensland's proximity to the equator, sun can be up at 4.30am in the summer. We bought black-out curtains almost immediately.
Do you blame them? I don't. America as a country is getting terrible every year, fueled by extreme polarization and division. I'm Malaysian and I feel very apathetic towards my own government. Because why should I care? What difference does it make when our lives (us Malaysians) are still going to be divided and unequal anyway. I vote for the first time this year (again, in Malaysia) and I honestly don't care who won. Us Muslims get shit either way.

The original goal of the event, which they still will try to achieve, is to attract Western tourists to their country en masse. They already have the Middle Eastern market. They have seemingly started to realize that the level of change needed to become an attractive tourist spot for Westerners will take decades. So now, they have pivoted to playing the upholders of Islamic values for brownie points. It takes being backed into a corner for a foreign minister to bring up the fact that Western nations buy oil and gas from them despite their human rights violations. Doesn't bode well for the big picture tourist attraction plan.
Fuuuuuuuuuck that. Where is Australia in all of this? They just let a foreign government sexually assault their citizens? And their only response is a lawsuit?

Exactly. All these people telling athletes and others to take a stand are sitting in the comfort of their presumably western homes and don't have to worry about disappearing in a Qatar prison.
They have to. Even if they gave Sinema an open field and ran no one, her numbers in Arizona are so poor she'll lose to almost any Republican. She's underwater with every age/race/education demographic, and her approval rating among Democrats is abysmal.
2. That’s not the last thing Democrats want..third party doesn’t necessarily have to be just Libertarian (not that Libertarians are bad, I much prefer them to the GOP, but their interests/Dems’ interest can differ greatly at times). Off the top of my head there’s the Green Party, a marijuana legalization party in MN, etc. Hopefully more third parties would pop up in the future with expansion of RCV. An anti-corruption/political reform party? Sign me up.

Hypothetical question. Would you prefer a Republican over Sinema if that Republican was contractually bound to vote with the democratic party on 93% of votes?

I don't know about that. Sometimes you have to yell to be heard...even if Dems hold the house, there are places like Florida and Wisconsin where protests and political activism are gonna be necessary if they ever want their voices to count for something. It's important to craft policy to help people, but we can't forget that there are some places where the democratic process has been corrupted to the point where it doesn't matter anymore whether the people there support you. We need to take steps to address that, and getting loud in those places is a necessary part of making sure we put in the extra effort to help those people have their voices returned to them.

Exactly. Every race is local, so candidates have to pitch ideas that resonate with their electorate. A deep Blue district might be supportive of progressive rhetoric or DSA slogans, but purple or lean-Red ones aren't going to.
__Under current climate targets, there will be virtually no glaciers left in Central Europe by the end of the century, according to an international study with Swiss participation.__.
With a rise of 3°C by 2100, the glaciers of Central Europe will have disappeared completely, they found, while a rise of 1.5°C – which would involve setting stricter climate targets – the melting would be in the order of 60%.
With a rise of 3°C by 2100, the glaciers of Central Europe will have disappeared completely, they found, while a rise of 1.5°C – which would involve setting stricter climate targets – the melting would be in the order of 60%.
Worldwide, the most optimistic scenario in the study would see glaciers lose 26% of their mass compared to 2015; ice-sheets would only survive in the high mountains of Asia, Alaska, Russia, and the Arctic and Antarctic. At the same time, sea levels would rise by 115 millimetres.

Of course, the anti-humanity group already thought of that and have spent billions on convincing the world that everything should be done about climate change except the shit that actually works, by pushing scams like carbon capture, personal responsibility, and electric vehicles as all that can be done about it, whilst also buying out political parties to let them hoard the incomprehensible amount of wealth their companies have accumulated, and do absolutely nothing worthwhile to society using that money. Personal profit is the only thing that matters for them, and greed is the whole of their character.

To those who think that they can just get a ‘win’ and drop some ‘uncomfortable truths’ on people with legitimate arguments against the Democratic Party’s messaging, here’s something ‘uncomfortable’ for you; Minority gun ownership in the US is drastically on the rise due to an increase in racial violence perpetrated by right-wing perpetrators/hate groups and by a lack of law enforcement to… you know… do their fucking jobs. Until the systemic issues are dealt with in an appropriate manner, Dems will lose on this issue forever. None of y’all have read anything about Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs or have seemed to make the connection that since the police are doing Jack-shit against literal domestic terrorists (see; nearly every major mass shooting for the last 20-25 years), minority groups are taking things into their own hands. You want to alienate a necessary part of your base? Go demonize P.O.C’s and LGBTQ rights leaders that support 2A Rights for self defense purposes. See how far that gets you.

The balloon violated international treaties that China and the USA are signatories to, specifically Balloons have some inherent advantages over satellites, including being dramatically less expensive to build and operate, the ability to pick up much weaker signals due to being hundreds of miles closer to surveillance targets, and the ability to be able to surveil a target for hours at a time instead of the few minutes per day that a satellite can be over the same target.

So true. China is why fent took over the opiate scene in USA. They’re definitely pleased with that one. Then there’s TikTok which does have good content but it also rots brains if people let it. Then Russia with all the divisive propaganda has enjoyed a win because Americans are more divided than ever now. I don’t dare share my views on certain subjects for fear of getting harassed about them. Russia and China have been fighting us without traditional weapons and Americans are none the wiser in fact in a lot of cases we’ll help them.

Scandinavia is capitalist. Scandinavian leaders and political figures over the years have complained at various times about the American progressive trend of calling them socialist. They are merely social democratic/regulated liberal capitalist. They certainly show that capitalism of the social democratic/regulated liberal flavor works well. They don't show that socialism works, because they aren't socialist.

Capitalist" instead of socialist. The State owned and managed everything, not the proletariat (working class). The state was comprised of politicians, not the proletariat or peasantry. So no, these regimes were not marxist or socialist. See Noam chomsky on this:

And then those who rightly recognize that social democracy/liberalism isn't socialism and who label themselves as pro capitalist can find themselves being opposed from the left because of the growing number of folks on the left who genuinely think that "socialism" is just "government doing good things" and thus if a Democrat doesn't call themselves socialist, they don't want government to do good things. So it makes it easier for divides to occur within the Democratic base and for conflicts to occur.
That’s all they know how to do anymore. They can’t lead or govern or problem solve. They had control of the house, senate and White House from 2016 - 2018, all they managed was tax cuts for the richest of Americans. While immigration reform was then and continues to be now, the biggest campaign issue for all republicans. But when they were actually in a position to fix it…nothing…nada…crickets. Because they don’t care. They only know how to be dissenters. They are self serving assholes that use hate and decisiveness to hold power and built their individual wealth. Wake the fuck up, stop voting for these pieces of shit.

I really have no idea why there are women in this country who are working to ensure their daughters have less freedom and options and opportunities than they did. It’s next level fucked. Boomers think they are the greatest generation when they’re just the most entitled. Entitlements galore. They can’t imagine another world in which they don’t use their entitlement to tell people what they should do with their lives and how to live. Literally every boomer will say that they are practically the hardest working American ever, when in actuality they just have jobs and work like everyone else. It’s constant self aggrandizement. It’s a whole generation that was given so much that they just can’t imagine other people actually work harder than them and have far less than them. It doesn’t compute in their brains. The abortion issue is just like a relic and vestige of the past that they must wield power over even though they’re too old to fuck their wives and too self centered to empathize for women, who made the grave mistake of being human with another human and having an unintended pregnancy.

This is incredibly incorrect. The money is already spent. This isn't new debt, it's paying the bills we have incurred and already agreed to pay. Furthermore Republicans are demanding cuts to Medicare and Social Security. These things are paid for by the working public who have money come out of their paychecks every pay period. Republicans are basically wanting to take money directly from American people that they have been investing for their future, all the while the Republicans are calling these programs handouts, entitlements, etc to try to change the narrative and justify screwing people out of retirement and healthcare that they have already paid for.

Exact same principal with money/wealth/power. And considering they've done far more than drink our collective milkshake by this point - all while condescendingly suggesting to just add another notch on the belt - how fucking gaunt must we get before we start eating the rich? Rhetorical question, but suffice to say... very. Unfortunately, just as the self-proclaimed "Christian" nationalists have proven that the depths they're still willing to dig is bottomless, I don't think there is a limit to how much we as a society will put up with; at least, not with our current rate of comfort consumption (everything, not just food) & willful distractedness. Who knows, maybe Elon's revealing public tantrum on his new toy can ultimately have a positive impact on humanity, if it manages to be the straw that turned Twitter into Parler. Dude's already fucking sprinting towards this outcome, and it can't come soon enough.

The problem is that even when no one is being explicitly “forced” via actual physical force or laws more often than not women face extreme social and family pressure and become essentially persona non grata in most Islamic countries personally and professionally for taking off the Hijab.

A lot of the inflammatory events could have been adverted had the area been cleared of gawkers and idiots could work together instead of trying to proclaim they were going to be the genius to free him. I just feel so awful for his brother and friend desperately trying to get him out while rescue workers played strategist from a safe distance. The absolute disrespect his body was treated with afterwards is appalling as well.

This is far beyond lying, it is getting scary as hell, he is now believing his own lies and living in his own fantasy world. probaly getting feed disinformation so he can tell the people the "truth".
Calculated? It doesn't exactly take an Einstein level IQ to lie your way into a losing invasion, and then keep on lying. Putin played his entire propaganda hand when he literally delayed his invasion plans by one week in a facile attempt to pull a gotcha. "Haha your intelligence agencies said I planned to invade on Feb 14th, but you fools didn't realize that I would delay my invasion by a week... You complete fools I have outsmarted you all" And then everything that has transpired since has only served to reinforce the complete incompetence of Russian governance at all levels. He's not the mastermind you're giving him credit for. He's a failing dictator with a failing reputation, propped up locally and exclusively by a propaganda machine he has slowly been losing control of. Russia is a failed state that hasn't realized yet its a failed state. Shit is gonna be ugly for a while after the complete collapse, but that will be pussy foot china's problem to deal with.
Yeah I've read... On reddit, that this is part of how they fight war first they send in the unwanted poorly armed as cannon fodder basically to waste ammo and reveal the positions of the enemy, then they send in another wave, then finally their is the wave that is best equipped, but who knows how much of those last 2 part's are horse shit... That's why they are threatening nukes. I prey they do not resort to using nukes on their neighbor. Vladimir certainly is bringing back the soviet union in the worst way possible for Russian citizens (I presume only men are conscripted so Vlad can take advantage of the ladies).
Oh absolutely. As someone who's worked in freezers even with only -15 f, the cold penetrates even thermal gear. Cover your mouth and nose because it will run and freeze on your face and make it worse.

Absolutely. I grew up in a prairie city that got pretty damn cold in the winter - the worst it got was about -40 but regularly in winter it would go to -30.

Exactly. People seem to forget that 70% of Russians live in urban areas, these people have coats to get them from the parking lot to their door or wait for the bus for 20 minutes. Most of them live in cities, they're not off stalking through the countryside in -20 all night.
Pitkin county is at 9300 votes counted and CBS estimates that there are 2300 votes. Last election the D candidate got 74% of that counties vote and this year Frisch is outperforming that candidate in ever single county so far so let's say he holds at 80% of the vote there, then that's another 1840 votes for him and 460 for Boebert and that's around 1380 net. Garfield county is at 90% votes counted 23500, so 2600 votes remain and if he remains at the same percentage, then he will get a net of 350 votes there. Then Pueblo county has about 3100 votes left and if he's at the same percentage there, then he nets 275 votes. There aren't enough votes left in red counties to to get her there. Even if he got 74% of the remaining vote (1100 net) like the 2020 Democrat in Pitkin and then you switch the numbers in Garfield and Pueblo county to give Boebert the votes I'm thinking Frisch will get, then she still loses.
There are rumors more votes are left in Garfield County, which has favored Frisch and more votes in Mesa County, which has favored Boebert. Those rumors haven't been verified or denied by either county.

Remember when R use to use the “are you better off now line of BS” they sure as hell didn’t do it during trump Re- election campaign but they did figure out how to make our lives miserable by passing laws when they had total control to screw us over today and tomorrow and if a D won - those laws will still be in place (example- let’s take out train safety regulations that Obama put in place) ALSO- why the fuck didn’t they do immigration laws when they had the majority? It was all build the wall Mexico will pay for it but NOTHING got done on immigration- they did pass…wait for it….tax cuts for the wealthy! We need our youth to vote , it’s their future and they need to get these morally bankrupt politicians out of office.

Exactly. I worked with progressive orgs in Texas for 10 years to turn Texas blue. It only got more red as the people fleeing from NY and CA aren't the liberals. Texas is going to be R for a long time, all sanity to the contrary.

I don't really think the ballot drop off watchers are relevant to this particular batch of votes. For one, the ballots in question are all election day drop offs where people walk into an active polling station to drop their votes in a box. The "poll watchers" were monitoring drop boxes that were out in the community pre-election day. The votes being counted are also from red areas and any drop box monitoring I heard about was in blue parts of town. Most of the state votes by mail and has done for years, so any reported drop box watching activity was really only going to deter a small portion of the votes cast in the state. That's not to say that it's not problematic behavior, just that it's a vanishingly small amount of votes that would potentially be impacted based on how the state normally votes and the fact that they were only watching traditionally blue areas. In order to have a large effect on the outcome, the drop box watchers would essentially need to be scoping out every mailbox in Maricopa County which is just not practical.

Meanwhile in Indonesia looking at the religious fundamentalists they seem to be more concerned on social conservative issues such as LGBT's, Sinfulness and other human follies such as free sex that they believe are the cause of natural disasters. Like really they don't think global warming will impact their lives at all, but if it does they're ready to blame it on the west for causing it, not because the west pollutes and litters (were at a time when both sides don't particularly respect the environment), but for not following particular instructions from a particular god, of a particular belief from the middle east. Yeah were all fucked mate.
The Chinese government is hypocritical. They expect the world to forget how they conquered and claimed their neighbors lands and continue with territorial expansion to this day. Then, in the same breath, they point at Japan's defense spending and cry fowl because the Japanese tried the same nonsense nearly a century ago.

Chinese mentality... They hate each other across Asia because everyone tried to invade everyone in a certain moment in their history, with great loss of life. China tried to invade everyone in his area several times, with more or less success, and Japan was more successful in the 20th century at the same game. Japan changed his game after WWII and they're more successful than china in soft power.

DOJ also states in the letter that “disclosing non-public information about ongoing investigations could violate statutory requirements or court orders, reveal roadmaps for our investigations, and interfere with the Department’s ability to gather facts, interview witnesses and bring criminal prosecutions where warranted.”.

Yeah, I did a double take when I read this line. Like wait what, the DOJ is investigating, doing their job, while Gym’s time is mostly spent doing political theater. Not even playing politics or doing his job. Just political theater and sabotaging the functioning of the US government.
It’s really textbook post-WWII armored doctrine, even Guderian and Rommel knew this stuff in France and North Africa. The armored unit is only the head of the snake but you need 360 degree protection including mechanized infantry and at least marginal air superiority, something considerably harder to do when your enemy has operational fighter wings, SAM defense systems and shiny new anti-armor/infantry drones that aren’t the size of a school bus.
Also the German demand was not honest. I am pretty sure that Scholz is primarily concerned that the US 2024 election will be won by Trump/Republicans. In his last term Trump openly discussed to Blackmail NATO Countries for the US Security commitment. With a possible returning of Trump it doesn’t make sense to send the best German Tanks to Ukraine, without the same baking by the US, because the republicans could easily blackmail Germany, when Germany send most of there tanks to Ukraine and following that is highly dependent on US security guarantees.

How is the reason bs. There are no logistics in place right now in Europe to service the abrams. The leopard is the most widely used tank in Europe right now. Also Germany didn’t do anything but show that the alliance members all have very different goals.
And thanks to this extensive field testing, we now know that our weapons can easily kick the shit out of Russian forces. Thank you for your contribution, comrade Putin.
Absolutely not. Trump would have totally distanced the US as far away from it as possible while threating to pull out of NATO if they assisted (which he did already talked about prior...) and thus allowing Russia to walk in as planned.

Exactly. For context we did the same for Iraq post-invasion and Syrian rebels.. and they squandered it for years. Granted, it’s a completely different type of war.. but the methods of assistance are pretty similar.

A given not necessarily, a possibility absolutely. That’s why NATO needs to be very clear to Russia on what their response to a nuclear attack would be and that it would not be tolerated.

If Russia uses nuclear weapons that’s it. One nuke launches and there will be a dozen in response. Of course Russia wouldn’t take that lying down either and regardless of the incompetence of their military I refuse to be liege we know every launch site they have and even if we did I refuse to believe we have the capability to hit them all before launches occur. Even if we did the nuclear response from NATO would likely cause enough damage and fallout to push us into a miniature nuclear winter and then we’ve got a lot more problems than we did before.

The problem is the fallout from even a small nuclear detonation in Ukraine could very easily hit NATO country’s and at that point Russia has used a Nuke against NATO even if indirectly. People don’t realize how tightly packed many of the country’s in Europe are. Ukraine is not a particularly large country, and because of its shape there aren’t many areas in Ukraine that are terribly far from a NATO border. Even less points within Ukraine that aren’t close to a NATO border would be worth hitting with a nuclear strike. The most likely use of nuclear weapons from Russia would be a small tactical nuke. But tactical nukes can be as large as 100 kilotons. For context the Chernobyl event was equivalent to 0.3 kilotons and the exclusion zone for that covers 2,600 km^2 ……..

I agree. He's done a good job, but his general image and demeanor will make it difficult for him to shed the "elitist left-coast limousine liberal" framing. When you look at every Democrat President in the past 50 years, they've all had a certain folksiness about them (see Carter and Clinton especially). Come to think of it, most of the Republican Presidents too. Even the ones that went to Ivy league schools and grew up in New England. "Not looking too urban or coastal" is an important facet of winning the Presidency.

Hypothetically, sure. But most politicians are busy just getting that word out to their own constituents (and don’t do that great a job of it). I’m across the country and every week see a headline that is “[good thing about CA] [insert how Newsome caused it here]”.

If you were the leader of a country and losing a war mean your country would collapse. What line wouldn’t you cross? What button wouldn’t you push? I don’t think Ukraine can military beat Russia but if they can they won’t live to see the results of their sacrifices. That seems to be pretty obvious for anyone with a brain. Russia will nuke that place if they lose.
Comparing Napoleon to Putin is also a huge disservice to Napoleon because Napoleon was an intellectual man who was genuinely interested in knowledge for its own sake (even before becoming First Consul of France he was admitted as a member of the French Academy of Sciences; he also considered it important to bring teams of scholars with him on his Egyptian expedition - they ended up discovering the Rosetta Stone), a reform minded man who emancipated the Jews, abolished surfdom in the areas he conquered and oversaw the creation of the Napoleonic Law Code (which survives in many countries to this day - in fact Napoleon once expressed the wish that he be remembered for the creation of his Code rather than his military victories), and a much more rational and personable man who could actually take criticism from friends and listened to others' advice even if he didn't always follow it (Putin meanwhile surrounds himself with only yes man and no one dares oppose him).
The graph on p.1 summarizes the comparison over 3 quarters, from Sept 2021 to Jun 2022. Effectively, their new methodology produced higher growth estimates for the first quarter (7% vs 5%), slightly lower estimates for the second quarter (3.7% vs 4.4%), and substantially lower estimates for the 3rd quarter (0% vs 3%). Their methodology is intended to provide more timely quarterly revisions to estimates, rather than the single annual revision that is currently done. Both their new method and the annual revision leverage the large QCEW samples, while existing quarterly estimates rely only on smaller samples from a different survey. I think the takeaway is that, if their methodology correctly mirrors the annual revision, job growth is being overstated in the quarterly estimates in the last two quarters, and the trend indicates flattening growth.
where's the lie? Biden cited the numbers that were available at the time. if those numbers are later revised that doesn't retroactively turn his statements into lies.

Will there ever be an investigation into the handling mishandling of the pandemic? Other than whatever clown show the new house has planned for Fauci? Kushner should have to answer to this under oath. Most people don't even know that he literally and unnecessarily caused distress and death to thousands, maybe tens of thousands of Americans. At this point, my best hope for some form of accountability is someone famous or with deep pockets doing an Oscar-worthy documentary that casts a dark cloud over this evil cartoon villain for the rest of his pampered life. He's despicable.
Thanks for the info. The administration was such a shitshow, that you forget some of these scandals that should have ended multiple careers. Truly amazing this happened.

Remember. The reason why didn't implement a well thought out emergency plan earlier on the pandemic is because Kushner thought this would be a big city problem and they could turn the narrative to blame the cities.
They could have gone as hard as they wanted. Still would have failed. Motivation doesn't fix supply lines and logistics utterly ruined by systemic corruption.
I read it. And I have always believed that Ukraine can and will win, and it will be a bloodbath before it happens. But the point is that even if Ukraine might win they will only do so by fighting for their life against a superior enemy. Because if they slack they will not win. The only reason they have managed to survive this far is because they have done everything by the book, and Russia has failed at a lot of simpler tasks.

just typical American schizophrenic online mentality. You find it on American comment sections of either side (left or right). You are either for the narrative or you must be some kind of spy sent there by the opposing side. You can try to argue with them that you are having a rational argument, but it's like trying to convince a religious person. In fact these political sides are like religions at this point.
Not the same commenter, but I'd explain it as; hypocrisy isn't illegal, so getting Democrats upset when they don't have the power to stop it, makes them seem weak. (In authoritarian minds).
In fact, most airlines not named Southwest performed pretty well over Christmas. As I mentioned previously in this thread on the day Southwest had 70% cancellations, American Airlines was at 0% and United was at 1%.

On a day when Southwest had 70% cancellations, American Airlines was at 0% and United was at 1%. So most of the industry handled the disruption well with minimal unnecessary delays or cancellations. Southwest was the one exception. I doubt very much a fine imposed even his first day on the job would have prevented the SWA management meltdown this Christmas. But if they don't issue refunds and/or pay for meals, hotels for this meltdown he will then be able to fine them for that.

There are so many more references to women fighting, leading battles worldwide across eons. Always love learning new (to me) ones. Thanks for sharing!
The Philippines was predominantly a matriarchal society (maybe similar to how some Native American tribes have a strong matriarchal influence) and it was very egalitarian as well. That is until the colonizers changed a large part of the culture and now machismo runs rampant. (As an aside: men who preferred to dress as females were still an integral part of the culture and even held positions relating to spirituality for example. Interestingly, Tagalog/Filipino language does not have male/female pronouns. It uses something equivalent to “they/them”.).

The assumption that only male soldiers rape is a incredibly dumb one, you don’t know EVERY female soldier and how they act on the battle field, I agree with your historical points (except the “Woman King”) but now you are just making all of them look like saints (don’t get me wrong most probably are) but just because they’re women doesn’t mean there can’t be a few rotten tomatoes in the tomato stack.

Right? Not like women in combat is some weird modern invention. “Woman King” just reminded the world the all female Agojie were not only capable, but fearsome and highly effective warriors. Israel mandates a minimum of 24 months of service from female citizens. My tiny Jewish friend from Israel served and knows Krav Maga and how to use an uzi. There’s historical evidence of female Vikings. There’s the legend of the Amazon’s. There are plenty of examples where women can be trained to be a capable military force and commanders with the side benefit that they don’t sexually assault the population they’re deployed to.

So yeah, I’m impressed India permits women to serve in the military, has an all female contingent, and has deployed them to an active combat zone. I don’t view that as a bad idea.
One of the most recent is a bill proposed in the Indiana legislature which would force teachers or administrators to notify parents if the student wants to change their “name, attire, pronoun, title, or word to identify the student in a manner that is inconsistent with the student’s biological sex at birth.” Similar bills have been pushed in other states like Arizona and New Hampshire.".
Chester Middlebrook-Pierce, a researcher who most famously helped create the foundations of Sesame Street, believed in a form of discrimination called childism, and believed that not including children as peers in discussions directly concerning them was one of the most prevalent and unaddressed forms of discrimination. So firstly, I'd say so much of the answer comes down to, 'who does the child feel safe telling this information to?' and sometimes, they're going to feel safe telling a teacher and not a parent, and if a teacher feels like a parent should know, they should make sure the child is aware because if they're being harmed at home, they may not speak up but they'll be the only ones that even have a chance of speaking up about it.

No, the dems are dangerous compromisers already and moving to the right to coddle these fuckheads is wrong. I mean, what else could you even offer them that they wouldn't dismiss as lies anyways? Healthcare? They don't care. A better economy? They don't believe it. Better wages? They think that's handouts for "burger flippers".
So the argument is that allowing states to go their separate ways on this issues is the same as establishing that one church (Northern Conservative Fundamentalist Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, for example) has the support of the Federal government, and thus violates the 1st Amendment.

I’m just so pissed off. I’ve been with the same woman for 15 years, married 10 in July. Now people who have been married multiple times are voting on the legality of my marriage. How dare they? Nothing wrong with people getting divorced but what the actual fuck.

You mean there's no correlation that the Biden Administration wants to take the First in Nation status away from NH? This seems so biased. Our President and his Congress and Senate have passed more legislation in his first two years then anyone expected. He supports very progressive policies, but it is not the President's fault that some of the more progressive legislative ideas have not made it past the Senate (in particular - Sinema/Manchin). The House did an amazing job and I think the Senate did the best they could. I'm not saying that we shouldn't look at other candidates, but we should focus on why another candidate would be more likely to win against a Republican, not how terrible Biden is. I always wonder who they poll when they say that his "polling numbers are very dismal." This is trashy for a Democratic aligned activist group to do. IMO.
This headline and these underhanded, would-be-disguised, RepubliKKKan slander pieces are just a further embarrassment to the already pathetic, nothing-to-offer-but-hate-and-lies, right.

Citation needed. While I'd read a lot of "doctors _could_ refuse you as a patient" in the context of non-emergency care, I never saw any examples of doctors actually doing that. I've really only seen that documented in practice for transplant recipients. Because there's lots of people who need transplants and if you aren't willing to do what all current medical science supports as decreasing your risk of infection/increasing your chance of survival, they'll pass that organ on to someone who is willing to take care of it. And that seems entirely fair.

This process could definitely use some reform, but then again, I'd rather see a French style, national healthcare system in the US, where the government provides the financial backing for healthcare and insurance companies transition into regional points of adjudication and contact, working according to unified, government guidelines, where profit isn't the motivation for healthcare.

However, there is clear evidence that for Canada’s health care system, less choice in insurance coverage (although guaranteed), has not resulted in less choice of hospitals, physicians, and diagnostic testing and treatments compared to the U.S. In fact, there is arguably more.".

Ok, so I work for a nonprofit company, so there maybe bias there, but the concerns with fraud are often due to statistical observations that can come about from either a specific treatment being historically abused or from a provider tripping a few triggers where it seems like they're constantly prescribing/pushing for something that may not be statistically common, for the overall population.

Yeah I have. I consume a variety of news sources. When’s the last time a liberal attacked a Republican Congressperson because of some thing Jim Acosta said? Never. Yet I can list three recent politically motivated attacks and attempted attacks by conservatives on democratic elected officials based on things Tucker Carlson has said. Radicalizing people to commit acts of terror. That’s the very definition of a terrorist organization.

Rule changes are in order, imo. For example, you cannot call yourself news if the ratio of news to opinion is x/amount and opinion should be in big bold letters during the entirety of a segment. I know, I'm dreaming.

I honestly think they need Nato in this war at this point so they can lose AND save face - pretend that they denazified Ukraine, fought all of Nato to a stalemate, and were the bigger country in de-escalating from a nuclear war against the aggressive russophobic west. It will be a glorious victory.
If Russia used nuclear weapons in Ukraine (they won't, because it doesn't fit their strategic goals, but just to satisfy a 'what if'), there would be a large conventional response by a US led coalition (not NATO itself, but of 'willing partners') against all Russian assets not inside the borders of Russia and Russia would be sanctioned to the point that their only trade partners would be, maybe, China.

No matter what their called. I can't imagine how large of a brick the pilots shit when the F-35's rolled up. I doubt they knew they were there until they announced.

The F35 is the most technologically advanced jet ever made, a little bit more advanced in terms of electronics than the currently updated f22, much more advanced than the SU57 (the best Russian stealth plane, of which only 21 were ever built) and astronomically ahead of basically every other plane on earth.

I’m American-Turkish. You are exactly right. Religiousness in America and Turkey have similar spectrums. There are people who are largely secular. There are this who identify with a religion but follow the rules loosely or as they suit them. Then there are degrees of more extremism. The less educated and more rural parts of both countries tend to have more hardcore believers who also happen to be the most intolerant of others. In Turkey and in the US, religion has been used by politicians to strenhen their tribal support and political power. AK party in Turkey and Christian Evangelical Conservatives in US are absolutely cut from the same cloth. They both have very authoritarian and illiberal sensibilities.

Keep voting for nominally educated monsters who proliferate gun-violence, Republicans. That's who you are.
The stunningly idiotic Russian take is not that Ukrainians can't physically (due to lack of ability) attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine....it's the stated position that it is MORALLY WRONG for Ukraine to attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine. It is astounding. "Don't you DARE attack our missile launching jets that we are using to wreck you mutherfuckers, your mothers, your children, your schools and hospitals. You are morally obligated to let us kill you.".
This is the reason the US refuses to give Ukraine ATACMS (very long range precision missiles that can be launched through the HIMARS platforms and hit inside Russia proper), due to the fear of escalating to nuclear weapons retaliation by Russia, in fact it was just revealed this week that the US somehow (not detailed yet) blocked the HIMARS platforms they sent from even being able to launch these missiles (as if they could have gotten them from elsewhere XD) so even if they did send them, unless it was a software update/flip of switch, they wouldn't be able to use them.

Good. But the NYT articles today have been absolute trash today repeating how this is Ukraine "escalating" the war. No dickheads, this is self defense hitting the military site that has repeatedly attacked Ukraine in an unprovoked war. What is Ukraine supposed to just let itself get attacked again and again without response?
Internally, Poland's government is pretty shitty, and the Polish and Hungarians backed each other because they're both right wing leaning, ultra-conservative.
as shitty as it is, it might be a good thing if another eastern european country votes a government in that is like polands, because the millisecond that there is another country that will play the game with poland, they'll throw Orban under the bus and Hungary will be absolutely fucked.

Its a shitty situation all around because Hungary is full of decent people but their elections are basically ruined, Orban has taken control and fucked the system so badly , that legally its almost impossible to vote him out now.

My mom was in Canada. She just volunteered to translate for the refugees who were arriving. My reference to the heroes was for those who resisted the invasion and was not meant to include my mom. Her life was not easy, but it was a dream compared to what those people courageously suffered, and to what Ukrainians are bravely suffering right now.
It was in the context of it being easier for the FIFA organizers. It’s easy to get things done when you’re working with one person who can demand anything. If they’re cooperative, that means the organizers get whatever they want. Pesky democracy slows things down, adds checks and balances, and ensures the safety and well-being of ordinary people. Those all tend to get in the way of things like functionally-enslaved migrants workers who die regularly while building stadiums in the same heat deemed unsafe for the professional athletes who will later play there. Or having a police force willing to commit human rights violations and arrest/kill dissidents or anyone your dictatorial friends deems undesirable.

Really? The article says "Ecuador also got attention for chanting 'we want beer' during the opening game." as if it was a separate incident and this is for something else. Apparently it was something derogatory against Chile? I wish I knew what it was.

Unfortunately this likely would mean most WC would have to be hosted in countries with a significant leagues (i.e England, France, Germany) or countries were conversion to football is easier (US American football stadiums) or require significant logistic challenges to allow joint hosts for smaller nations or nations that don't have a deep football heritage.

2. There were many stipulations as to having the WC in Qatar, which as you can see, because of their “culture” those stipulations have gone out the window.

Too many corporate housing investors, too many AirB&Bs, too many books and podcasts telling investors how to get rich in real estate, too many real estate investors over-leveraged or outright greedy, too many wealthy people owning several personal homes, too many houses allowed to rot into uselessness for the depreciation tax break. Fight these causes before building more housing.

No. The housing market in the US is many trillions of dollars. No company on earth can buy up a meaningful percentage unless you're talking about within a very small area.
It's odd to say it... but in a very abstract sense they kind of have. Between Russia's overall performance against Ukraine, their disastrous failure at airbourne attack of Hostomel, and the air defense situation.... Russia can't really do anything to Moldova. Not using conventional military.
Pawn, not knight? Pawns can’t jump squares, but knights can. That doesn’t mean they can survive behind enemy lines without backup, which is what these idiots were planning.

Exactly. I don't understand how people don't get this. Russia can't get to Moldova. They can't send supplies. I mean, at least the 7000 Moldovan troops can be resupplied with ammo. Russian forces there are effectively already encircled. Russia can't even fly fighter jets over Ukraine, let alone cargo planes.

Moldova is weak, militarily, economically, politically. Infiltrated by Russia for decades. BUT it's moving in the right direction and strategically speaking except NATO members the most stupid place for Russia to make threats against since it has no direct way of attacking in any conventional attack (Transnistria has a force of obsolete, unsupported and impossible to supply light russian troops that would be a walk in the park for Ukraine to mop up since they announced they will help Moldova if it comes to that).

Eh, that's too far fetched. Be more like Russia launched missile strikes AR Moldovan government but several missiles were intercepted over Ukraine and of the ones that made it, two hit residential neighborhoods, and one hit in a field. Russia deployed airborne forces to attempt to seize power but forces were shot down over Ukraine resulting in the death of many troops and several commanding officers. Russian forces in Transnistria briefly tried to fight their way into Moldova, but were harassed by Ukrainian HIMARS attacks. After several days of combat, the Transnistrian forces surrendered due to lack of ammo and supplies from Russia's inability to deliver supplies through Ukrainian defenses. Following the surrender, Moldovan forces were able to move and reclaim Transnistria. Russian president Vladimir Putin made several statements that red lines were crossed, and threatened nuclear attack, but took no action. Following the incident, the Moldovan government applied for membership into NATO and after much deliberation and hesitation from Turkey, Moldova was inducted into NATO on June 27th, 2024.

I'm not sure they wouldn't try. Russia takes big risks, and soldiers lives are cheap right now. They might rely on Romanian/Moldovan doubt and reluctance to shoot down a troop carrier... especially if it's disguised... however badly. A major with his finger on the trigger might be reluctant to perhaps start WWIII... for the few minutes it would take.
I lived there (Parika) for a year in 2020 when Covid hit and just went down this summer. They are definitely more chill and not outright murderous concerning lgbt. Ofc a lot of people have aversions to it and I got told expressively I'm not supposed to walk around in a skirt (I'm a tall straight dude). But even so this summer I went to the creek and even saw an "auntyman" (derogatory Carribbean slang for trans people, sometimes gay people and drag queens) live there and allthough they got a lot of stares, nobody hassled them, nobody shouted at them and I didn't see any other aggression towards them. The country still has a lot of development to do but I figure unless you're in a religious cult (there are many of them). You're more or less ok as long as you don't draw too much attention. The laws just kinda make it a "don't ask don't tell" type of deal. But as always Guyana is just about the slowest out of all the Carribbean countries to change.
Different laws affect different people differently. Depending on how you define sex, gay sex is outlawed by making anal sex illegal.
Both links are from the American Psychological Association. The first link is to a psychological researcher who looks into gun violence and mental illness addressing the myth that most are driven by mental illness.
"“Routinely blaming mass shootings on mental illness is unfounded and stigmatizing. Research has shown that only a very small percentage of violent acts are committed by people who are diagnosed with, or in treatment for, mental illness. The rates of mental illness are roughly the same around the world, yet other countries are not experiencing these traumatic events as often as we face them. One critical factor is access to, and the lethality of, the weapons that are being used in these crimes. Adding racism, intolerance and bigotry to the mix is a recipe for disaster.

Unfortunately, cluster B personalities aren’t going to seek therapy regardless of our healthcare infrastructure. They’re already convinced that regular people are the issue.
The main benefit of longer is you can whittle down election time and have a bit more parliamentary time to move stuff through. And generally the lack of ideas and infighting happens once they get more than a term in, the incumbent's issue. Sometimes you can buoy yourself out of that issue with nationalism (the present slate of Tories in the UK, as well as the SNP, both in government since before 2010, trading on nationalism more than anything else at this point), but that doesn't sell everywhere.

They say they're socially left-wing, but they are corporations that don't have emotions or morals and only care about money. Therefore, conservative. That also ignores the fact that in a global capitalist society, money is care so the whole socially left fiscally right thing just means you don't actually care enough to do anything to help anyone because money is more important.
Interesting. Genuinely. I hadn't heard of that before! Not looking to flame you in the slightest, but I am honestly curious. In what way(s) would you say the slide into fascism is built into the concept/application of neoliberalism?

and Netanyahu is doing everything he can to strenghten those negative feelings , He tries to dismantle the courts , He gave religious zealots positions from which they can affect the school curriculum and poision the heads of our kids . His ministers are cancelling every reform and change the last government did , even things that are undoubtedly positive just for the sake of eliminating every shred of evidence the last government happened . His mouthpieces are working full time trying to create internal conflicts inside the opposition . I honestly just want to leave but im a student in university and dont have the money anyway .

He's very very skilled at what he does. He's in a whole different ballgame as he's ruthless with literally no visible ideal other than straying in power. Other politicians in the so called left center are absolute jokes with egos and no carisma. And this is exactly the way he wanted it.
So the text doesn't really commit to any reduction in use of explosive weapons in civilian areas, beyond having policies to "help avoid civilian harm" and "take into account the direct and indirect effects on civilians and civilian objects," and "restricting or refraining, as appropriate, [...] when their use may be expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects.".
The British have no right and never had a right to claim Irish territory,the unionists have every right to be British in Ireland and have British passports , maintained cultural links with great Britain etc ,BUT NO RIGHT to claim Irish territory as British and everyone in it as british.the unionists can only really claim 2 of the 6 counties as unionist majority.there are 32 counties in Ireland, unionists are the minority they always have been the minority.if you say unionists / British have a right to claim Irish territory then you should not reject Russia's territorial claim over parts of ukraine. I'm Irish I know what I'm talking about ,the native Gaelic Irish have more claim over the land than people who were planted from Scotland and england during the ethnic cleansing of ulster in the 1600s. I respect unionists British citizenship and they should retain it in a united Ireland,yet you call me small minded?
I'm just trying to understand where the limit might be, and it seems logical that 15 or 16 year olds, or older, should be able to carry the most common advanced military firearm of the era as they go about their day to day lives, just as they were able to when the Bill of Rights was written.
So, extrapolate these rulings out to the full spectrum of the history and tradition relevant to when the second amendment was authored, and any teenager old enough to have served in a militia (15+ based on historical record) should be legally authorized to keep and bear arms as they go about their day, even if 8 hours of their day is spent in a school.

It's unfortunate that emulating their prophet and adhering to cultural norms around cousin marriage have undone common and well grounded taboos against marrying too close to the family tree.
Since Mohammed is reported to have married his first cousin, marrying one's first cousin has significantly less taboo in some Muslim communities and may be encouraged in others. While this isn't likely to cause problems when practiced as a one off thing, repetition over multiple generations can cause significant problems including significantly increased infant mortality rates and rates of genetic disorders due to detrimental recessive genes.

Nice. But you should definitely lie down and have pillow. You can pass out and hit your head. Otherwise it's relatively harmless. At least from a balloon. From the bottle you need to make sure you're getting oxygen. Some people plug in a breather and go unconscious on pure nitrous.

They’ve chosen extremism as a strategy… I think the best we can hope for is that her old district benefits from someone with actual plans to help them, and maybe that MTG is a bit sad that she no longer has her girl pal to do crazy shenanigans with on the floor of the House.

100%. Her actual role in the Republican Party as a do-nothing rabble rouser that repeats stuff she read in the comment section of ‘FEMINIST OWNED CRINGE COMPILATION!’ YouTube videos will be literally unchanged. Her name is on zero pieces of legislation and it will always stay like that. She’s the learning disabled kid that people pay to eat bugs, as she craves attention more than dignity or respect.

The Chinese might very well saber rattle and make a fair bit of noise if the US ever came to blows with North Korea. But I see no reason whatsoever why the Chinese would stick their neck out far enough to put it in striking distance of an American axe. North Korea isn’t nearly valuable enough to them for them to consider it worthwhile to piss off the world’s preeminent military superpower.
The U.S doesn’t want a war with North Korea because after its finished crushing their military like the insignificant relic it is. They would have a country sized mess they would be obliged to clean up.

Honestly... I don't understand why NK is allowed to "bully" those around them. If it comes down to "it", realistically NK would get mopped. Just saying.

Authoritarian governments MUST have enemies. This is just the most extreme example. They know they cannot win a land war with anyone, they would be starving a month in.

I love international politics. North Korea rattles the sabre and launches rocket after rocket Japan's way. Japan decides they need more security against their neighbor who keeps lobbing rockets their way, "How dare you be so aggressive!".
I pray that he really takes stock, puts his recovery first now, but he doesn’t have a good track record: ignored doctors advice, stopped taking meds after first diagnosed with HBP/heart failure in 2017; insisted on resuming grueling campaign for senate after near fatal, incapacitating heart attack/stroke in 2022; hospitalized twice in one month in 2023, then staff issues statement vowing his return to senate duties “ in a few weeks”. 🙄.
No, random voters in PA are definitely NOT part of any medical evaluations and associated decisions for elected officials. And again, PA voters were not deterred by Mr. Fetterman's slight speech deficits during the debates, and still felt he outperformed creepy Dr. Oz, and they voted him into office. Unless there is a recall (and afaik there isn't such a thing for senators in PA) voters do NOT have any say in whether or not Mr. Fetterman continues his term after his current treatment.

Ramifications? Not much, for brief absence. With him in office, the Senate is 49-51; without him, 50-50 but Harris always breaks ties, so he’s not really needed to pass bills—assuming manchin & sinema vote D.

Oh it will. His followers will say "he made the best out of a bad situation" which is absolute bullshit. If people think he's got this in the bag it's going to be a rude awakening. I'm not saying he will lose, but it's gonna be a tough race for him. I think it's gonna be a super low voter turnout this next election. A lot of people, including me, have just lost all hope in our government as a whole. That union thing was the nail in the coffin for a lot of us.

One President intentionally stole highly classified docs with highly sensitive intelligence info including info on nuclear stuff for another country. It's also highly likely, but yet to be proven this President sold/gave away some of the info to our adversaries. He was asked to return the docs, didn't comply, raided, and still done docs are missing.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This is just a continuation of a pattern that has been repeated over and over again, from blaming The Indigenous nations and the subsequent genocide that is still happening today, to Hitler’s hyperfocus and murder of Jews, to far right terrorists storming the capitol because their orange shit gibbon figurehead told them the democrats were cheating and the election was being stolen.

Absolutely. Their role is only to spew venom and distract from their incompetence. The far right is utterly unable to come up with solutions to ANY valid, existing problem so they come up with theatrics to non-existing ones.
That depends on quite a few things. China does not want an unstable and potentially unfriendly nuclear neighbor. They can tolerate North Korea because they have their entire existence by the balls. NK only exists because China allows it and benefits from it. A nuclear armed and unpredictable Russia, or even worse a breakup of Russia with multiple opposed successor states, does not serve China's interests. On the surface, one might think it does by keeping the West focused there but in reality China probably wouldn't risk it in case the instability led to the West taking advantage of the situation to install someone pro-US/EU and anti-China. If Russia fell into chaos, China would at least temporarily have aligned interests with the West even though their end goals would be different.

Possibly. He died a few days before I was born, so I didn't get to see it myself, but he's certainly not the enduring folk hero in the States that he is in Canada.
We may never know. Russian state media has publicly called for genocide in Ukraine and the elimination of their countries existence. In actions, beyond their illegal invasion and the death and destruction that has incurred, they have forcibly relocated over a million Ukrainians to Russia, including some 250,000 children and have started removing any books referencing Ukraine in Russian occupied territory, all of which is clearly genocide. Who knows how far he would have gone or what other atrocities he would have visited upon the people of Ukraine had they not stood up and decimated his invasion force making the world take note. It's not like Russia hasn't been responsible for the deaths of millions of Ukrainians in the past... Putin could very well have become the latest Russian tyrant to rival Hitler or Stalin even. Remember the Holodomor genocide!

>"[The] DOJ has not held a single suit of the insurrection accountable for the violent attack on the government that they launched to try to keep Donald Trump in power unlawfully, unconstitutionally," he said. "Here's my grave concern, there's a message that has been sent by the Department of Justice to the next aspiring dictator, to the next wanna-be autocrat who might consider trying to violently overthrow our democracy if he loses an election, the message that has been sent by the Department of Justice that if you do what Donald Trump did, if you try to violently overthrow our government, you will have more than two years to plot your next move.".

The map at that link is really telling. The most poverty-stricken states are all in the south, plus KY and WV. Possibly the biggest tell is the difference between next door neighbora VA and WV. VA in the top 10 lowest poverty rates while WV has the 7th highest. I wonder why.

He has an infinite budget, apparently, and the worst of the worst corporate interests backing him, so he could get away with putting up a bad Democrat candidate, even, (or blocking out any new and viable Republican ones, which doesn't seem so hard, especially considering his approval), which was the case last time. I don't buy the name recognition and seniority things on their own. It doesn't add up.

I'm not. This is well documentated, they tend to be more religous and socially conservative than other democrats. They also oppose abortion at a higher rate.
So what we want to consider a binary is actually an ongoing complex process that weaves together developmental biology and genetics, psychology and sociology, and the social context at the time.

Ha! Didn't think of it like that. You know how some comedians have a very racial following, like George Lopez and Hispanics? I was thinking that sort of thing. I happen to be white and a big fan of many black comics beginning with Richard Pryor.

I'm a little confused. Are you saying that mayor Pete's sexaulity was not an issue with black voters? I'm not so sure it wasn't because of data in the article we're discussing. Also, racism absolutely boiled to the surface during Obama's presidency. White republican voters were incensed by him in office. I heard morons in my part of the US call for his assassination.

There’s a whole bunch of chemistry going on during development that also controls the origin of other psychological and physiological characteristics. We know now that starvation in the mother can cause an obesity tendency that lasts for multiple generations. There’s a soup of hormones and enzymes and genes turning on and off and body parts growing and getting removed and crazy stuff going on. It’s honestly fascinating.

I live by a rule that accusations and proof need to be equal in proportion. So serious accusations need serious proof for example. The idea that a child is receiving sexual harassments or sexual assault is a serious accusation, so a softer indirect or even petty "proof" like "they saw two men kissing in the park" or "they drew that cartoon character in a broadcast tv show with big "sexy" hips" is not serious enough proof for me to believe someone has come to harm.

What they actually sell is a lot of partial systems (like the above mentioned barrels) that are then used by other countries' domestic industry. And then there's the other side of complete systems going to a completely different set of countries (like RM selling their Skynex/Skyshield stuff to Qatar, Indonesia or South Africa while nobody in Europe gave a shit about it and if they did they would rather buy the gun and build their own system with it; or like Diehl selling IRIS-T SLS/-M to Egypt for years while European countries were never interested in the whole system, Norway instead added the missile to NASAMS and is now building another system based on the missile with the same producer, and Sweden is cooperating with Diehl, also to produce their own system with mostly domestic industry based on just the missile).
You made that part up too. It handed over two other types of vehicles. It said it has approved the sale of the howitzers. So maybe nobody really knows? Expect you of course.
wait a minute, I gave, we hired a Very Important Firm, they found almost 100% Election Fraud from the Democrats ok, not 0, not 10 or 20 or even 50, they had a Total 100, nobody's ever even seen it this bad in our Country in a long long time. don't forget, I was up by millions and billions of votes, I had the Popular Vote many many times, they're saying, "President Trump did more than even Abraham Lincoln," Honest Abe, he chopped down that Beautiful Cherry Tree, and he could've lied about it, maybe he should've lied about it who knows, and I can tell you that I've never lied, not even once, you've had nothing but Total Honesty and Total Greatness. remember, I came in, they said to me they said, "Sir, we're out of War Ships," I said what happened, "it's Obama, Sir, he gave them all away to Zimbabwe," I said oh isn't that nice, here we are doing things probably as perfect as they've ever been under Trump, but then all of a sudden here comes Sleepy Joe and the Radical Left to hurt your Country, hurt our Flag, and we would've been President Forever if it wasn't for the Horrible Democrats trying to hurt us all. ok, you can thank me now, thank me sometime soon, whatever you want, and they say I'm too nice sometimes, and that's probably true.

It will happen, Lets be honest Turkey stands to gain from Bayraktar sales alone. As fir Hungary Orban the Vatnik Lover aint gonna kick up much once everyone starts giving him the evil eye. Not only that but it's pretty obvious once Vatnik Russia is given the boot the only way to make sure they NEVER fuck around and find out again with Ukraine is to make it clear that if they fuck with one country they fuck with everyone and they will kick their Kleptocratic shithole state into the first hole available if they try this shit again.
Yes, it would. It is why Ukraine has to fight, it's likely whatever the end of this war is, that is Ukraine for good.

But that's a pipe dream. The war will not suddenly end because Ukraine pushed back Russian troops from all of their territory.
Always strange to me that they assume kids will feel bad about the history and not identify with, like, The Union and these United States and the civil rights movement.
I think they DO believe kids will identify with theovement and see that treating people is wrong, and that's what they don't want. You can feel empathy for the past without feeling personally responsible and like you're the racist, and most kids know that. It's not like the lesson is "you're a bad terrible racist" it's "let's not do this is again here's why it's bad, because it hurt people" and that's what Republicans don't want because Republicans and conservatism is just a repackaging of the confederacy and always has been.

Hey. Other people aren’t answering so here’s my two cents. Once fascism, or in this case a reawakened form of Jim Crow, takes root, it’s very hard to uproot. Under this regime all protest will be treated as violence. But this repression must be met with vocal resistance at every turn to make it harder for it to expand. Here’s my suggestions for how to help:
100% agree. But also, these days I tend to be thankful somewhat for these events that have happened, I'd have never known the true character of so many that I know, or thought I knew. Vocal racists versus silent ones dilemma, I think I'd prefer the vocal one these days. I used to say look keep it to yourself and live and let live and it won't matter so long as we get along, but now I'm realizing we never did and there was always prejudice and falsehoods with friends and family, it just was unspoken. Now we know how much we dislike each other's characters, and I'm glad. That being said, it's hard to account for brainwashing and delusions that happen within someone from external influences. Do we hold those folks accountable for things that possibly cusp being beyond their control? How much say do we have in having our minds changed? It's hard to say, and hard to reconcile, but overall, I'd rather deal with the devil I know and not the one I don't. And if a fool like trump is what it took for family to hate family or friends to lose friends, then it was almost certainly inevitable anyways, and that says something. Jail the fucker, and let's move on/forward with what we have learned about this place and each other accordingly.

Not that I’m saying that we shouldn’t tax the rich more but everyone that thinks the gov should be doing more is already calling for taxing the rich. Sooner or later you can’t just tax the rich to pay for stuff. Then what?
How do you tax wealth unless it's realised for example Jeff Bezos does not have such high wealth because he has billions in cash he has such high wealth because he owns 10% of Amazon and as the valuation of Amazon (the amount of money people are willing to pay to own Amazon) increases his wealth increases but unless that wealth is converted to income there is nothing to tax. What you are proposing works, i am not saying that having high marginal tax rates do not work (Netherlands is an example) but it would not solve wealth inequality, what it would do is it can increase the quality of life of the poorest which is extremely important for us to do. On a side not I don't understand why these are even talking points in the United States because for the past 60-70 years US economists have been recommending everyone else to implement universal healthcare, get rid of useless spending on subsidies, build infrastructure, give affordable connectivity (public transport), give access to affordable education, and have a deciplined fiscal policy because it works in increasing the productivity of an economy and test these are talking points with polarization in the US.

There has always be two view on this. The liberal view want all people to finance his own retirement and if possible by private fund and the “social” one (the one that is originaly up in france) that mean all current workers contributions pay the cureent retired persons. In this all pay by their possibility and all receive by their need. And normaly in this view retirement pension are more like a continuation of salary and not a down payment of their cotisations.
Setting aside the bizarre matter of why anyone would claim to have accidentally flipped a table over, there is probably a 0% chance that Santos was ever in a room with Schwarzman, who has an estimated net worth of $30.1 billion and is literally one of the most powerful people in finance. (A spokesman for Blackstone told the Post that Schwarzman “has no recollection of any such incident or meeting Mr. Santos, and we have found no record of Mr. Santos having a business relationship with Blackstone.”).
During a meeting in early 2020, Santos claimed that he once accidentally flipped over a table while in the office of Stephen A. Schwarzman, the billionaire private-equity investor and Blackstone CEO. “I actually sat on a chair inside of Blackstone’s office on the day of the signing of a deal…and I flipped backwards, flipping the table on the chief executive…I flipped the table on Schwarzman.”.

2024 will be a major clusterfuck. Even if the Democrats outperform expectations and hold onto the White House it's possible that the Senate could flip to the GOP simply due to the map. The Democrats will have to defend three seats in Trump won states, those being West Virginia, Montana, and Ohio. If the Republicans flip those three seats they'll have the Senate majority back. This is especially considering the fact that across the last two presidential elections, hardly any states have split their tickets between President and Senate. No state did so in 2016 and in 2020 only Maine did, and that was only because the GOP had an incumbent there who was widely known for easily being able to get crossover support.

Belarus and many nearby countries are giving troops and loyalty to putin in exchange for heat (gas/oil). They need heat. If Hungary signs a gas deal with Russia (high likelihood?), Ukraine will be surrounded. The troops from the other gas signee countries will be in the hundreds of thousands.This means Ukraine has to defend all other border areas in addition to their current goals. Russia and those troops can overrun Ukraine by February. China is providing tons (in 50 ton loads) of winter gear to Russia. N. Korea is sending arms and troops. So, Ukraine will immediately need more guns, ammo, tanks, winter gear, and troops than expected. Don't forget to protect the waterfront and Moldova from Black Sea subs and ship attacks. putin won't squander this unique opportunity. Kick putin.
Edit: if by not integrated you mean that the US has not officially recognized them as part of their military then yes you're right, but they regularly take military contracts from the United States so it's more semantics than anything. The first sentence on their Wikipedia page about Iraq is "blackwater played a substantial role in the Iraq war as a contractor for the United States military".
After the partition plan by the UN, the Jews actually accepted to share the land and approved the existence of a Palestinian Arab state alongside Israel. The Arabs refused the partition plan and the surrounding arab states initiated the 1947-48 Israeli-Arab war which goal a was to throw all the Jews out. Didn't go as planned, the Jews win the war and pushed back the Arab states. Before that, the territory was the British mandate. Also after that war in the 50s, Jordan invaded and annexed Judea & Samaria, renamed it west bank, and threw all the local Jews out. After that, there is also the 1967 war, and then the 1973 war, Israel was systematically menaced by the Arab states which had one objective: destroy Israel. A lot of territories were offered by Israel in exchange for peace, for example the Sinai. The Golan was also offered in exchange for peace (but refused).
Really? You must be on a different reddit. The word Israel gets mentioned on here and everything becomes about how evil it is and how they bomb kids. Hell Jews in America are talked about and it comes back to Israel.
And it's quite literally just imagining. They base their views and actions on mostly imagined fears or outcomes. It's frustrating that they've even been allowed to get to this point; where they literally don't even bother or pretend to produce evidence beyond just saying they have it. That needs to fucking end.

(\ yes. It is deeply amusing/frustrating that they also have enough cognitive dissonance to like Trump because he disrupted order. But part of that also comes from them thinking "he was reorganising things to be more how we want it". I do miss the days when they'd stop talking there though, rather than having to admit out loud that they wish they could be more of a bigot).

If there was ever a time to convince young and/or uninformed Wisconsinites to vote, NOW IS THE TIME. My family is moderately conservative (if you can fairly call it that anymore) but have slowly been becoming more progressive over the years. When the topic of abortion comes up, they always say there’s no way it’ll go away… until it did and is in many places. Now that they know what’s at stake, they are all asking questions and are starting to realizing that the people they’ve historically voted for actually don’t have their (or most anyone’s) best interest in mind. Please, please, PLEASE don’t let us go further back than we already have, Wisconsin. This may very well be our last chance to protect democracy in our state.
Neither conservative candidate will help us humanitarian-wise. The other liberal candidate is a Reverend. Personally, I don’t want someone so close to the church involved in my state’s highest ranking court. That’s my opinion only. So, Janet is the strongest bet and her policies align with mine.
Nothing I read about ever cost 36 million bucks. I think there was one insane case in BC involving all kinds of spectacularly bad behaviour by the losing party, over years. That came in somewhere between five and ten million iirc.

It seems to be the easiest base. He has other holdings, but they're part ownership things. the law is very new (June), so they probably want to kick off with a test case.

Ukraine did recently have their highly successful Thunder Runs where they quickly gained a lot of their lost ground back. But those soon stopped and they were primarily successful because of some clever trickery that Russia isn't as likely to fall for a second time. Not to mention they used a lot of the weapons and vehicles they had been given from NATO nations and need replacements for what was used up. Those things just don't appear overnight. It takes months. Plus the time it takes to be trained on new equipment before you can use it properly. I think Ukraine is probably back on the defensive for a while now.
I believe that Russia (at this time) doesn't want to conquer all of Ukraine. They just want to fully capture and keep the areas that they illegally annexed. And Putin is content with losing a lot of men to accomplish this. If they can do that, Putin will call it a complete success. ( Of course he would probably come for the rest in a few more years) If Russia can simply hold out and make modest gains like they seem to be doing right now, then eventually Ukraine may be forced to surrender those areas just to stop the loss of life, both civilian and military that they are suffering right now.

Oh, I agree with you 100%. I meant only that I think they’re trying at least to play a long game and hope political support from abroad dries up sooner or later.

The donations bring Soros’ contributions to political campaigns and causes since January 2020 to roughly half a billion dollars — at the least — most of it steered through dark money nonprofit groups and going largely toward political causes aligned with Democratic Party.
The donations bring Soros’ contributions to political campaigns and causes since January 2020 to roughly half a billion dollars — at the least — most of it steered through dark money nonprofit groups and going largely toward political causes aligned with Democratic Party.
Soros, who personally donated $170 million during the 2022 midterms to Democratic candidates and campaigns on top of that, spread the additional largess through the Open Society Policy Center — a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that falls under the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations network, according to a copy of its 2021 tax filing, which was obtained by CNBC and is the most recent data available. The Open Society Policy Center also doled out $138 million to advocacy groups and causes in 2020. Two of Soros’ children sit on its board, the tax filings and its website shows.

Sure. But this is a financial crime that they have investigated for years, had the books, and now that he’s admitted it, it’s a fact that fraud occurred. They couldn’t get a forensic accountant to solve this without this guy? He must be a genius. We know trump runs his business like a mob boss. It’s ridiculous to think he was unaware.

3. He's still drawing a salary despite not being CFO. There is no way that he would get that if he flips. They are effectively bribing him in plain sight.
It was actually a strategy by the Russians in WWII. They had not sufficiently ramped up their military industrial complex prior to Hitler invading - so many "soldiers" in second waves of attacks were not sufficiently armed and were instructed to pick up the weapons of their fallen comrades.
Makes me wonder. I make beats and was in contact with a Russian guy almost daily about making music. We weren’t super close or anything but about two weeks before the war he stopped texting and just stopped posting music altogether. Thought he might have been taking a break, tried to contact him about the war and his thoughts (he seemed very liberal and against Putin). I just hope home boi ain’t in a ditch somewhere, he had some good tunes too…….

At the outbreak of the war jt was reported that Russia had told the majority of the troops they were only going to be participating in training exercises at the border, it wasn't until they were actually crossing into Ukraine that they were told they were actually going to war.

That easy, huh? For a conscripted teenager in a foreign land forced into a war to just call, trust both their home country and the country they are invading, to safely leave their old life and family behind.
Why does every generation, group, cause, wake up and think they are the first to feel a certain way. I feel for people who think it is not fair, but life is not fair. If you need to work harder than you thought, to get what you need the mistake was yours, work harder to till your dead and pass on work ethics instead of money. Your offspring will be better off.
I live in the US, have had an okay-ish job for the last 8 years and in December finally landed what I would consider a great job (making over $25 an hour with no education past high school) and the work itself is essentially baby sitting machines and making sure its flowing fix any problems to keep it flowing, One of the best manufacturers in the entire state of Wisconsin if you ask me and I wouldn’t even consider having children because of the financial burden.

Same. Having a house and a stable financial climate is a hard prerequisite for us. Responsibility for any children a person may have long predates the child’s very conception.

The Republican Party’s complicit nonchalance at —and even celebration of—Donald Trump’s rampant dishonesty, his habitually saddling taxpayers with covering inflated costs of his constant galavanting among his own properties and his attempted election-stealing just to name a few outrages are hallmarks of organized crime.

Absolutely. I don't think its programming decisions are directly about money, but you can still destroy it financially. At some point, the costs outweigh the benefits. Massive judgments tip the scales heavily in the cost direction.

Exactly. FCC and even the AG need to get involved. It’s not like these were harmless lies. They fueled an insurrection to overthrow a free and fair election. It’s insane they’re still allowed to operate as if nothing happened.

Rupert Murdoch has deliberately destabilized GLOBAL DEMOCRACY. Not just in the US, but in Australia as well. Destabilizing global democracy deserves being prosecuted thru ICC-which is why, I suspect, ALL of the Murdochs live inThe US. If they lived in Australia and were indicted, Australia would hand them over to the ICC. The US won’t. They’d have to travel outside the US and enter a country where Interpol could arrest them. With the GOP corruption tied w/ the Murdochs criminality….global democracy hangs in the balance.
Canada: the sanctions target 23 Russian individuals "involved in gross and systematic human rights violations against Russian opposition leaders," including police officers, prosecutors, judges and prison officials.
Bit of a rant here about my beloved country. Canada has opened the floodgates for anyone and everyone. 500,000 per year plus 250,000 international students and 125,000 temporary work permit employees in all industries. This is going to be more every year as per Justin Trudeau's policy. Rent for a one bedroom in Canada is averaging $2000. a month, if you can find one. Homelessness in the winter sucks. There will be many deaths this year in this country because there is no place people can afford to live. We have Ukrainians landing in Vancouver whom can't find a place and it has been on national news for awhile. This country will welcome you but don't expect a place to live unless you are renting a room for $1200 per month with a house full of people and one bathroom. There is absolutely a housing crises in this country, not to mention 24 hour waits in your local hospital to be seen and 3 day waits for a bed while you wait in the hallways with hundreds of other citizens.
Comparisons to Jesus, MLK, etc. are forms of delusions of grandeur. Mania can give a massively increased sense of self importance and an unfounded sense of greatness that are part of that. Right now, Kanye is literally viewing himself as being on the same level of significance as MLK. In the past, he has also compared himself to Jesus. These are typical features of a manic episode and part of the grandiosity and inflated sense of self that goes along with it. I think the important thing to realize is that Bipolar disorder isn’t an external disease like a virus, rather it’s just how his brain naturally works, so the fact that he made the mental leap to compare himself with MLK is consistent with that manic frame of mind.
Thank you. I was an LCSW, but I worked with kids so mood disorders were rare. I always wondered why the DSM has never created a diagnostic category for those who have exceptionally long manic periods. It is clear by Kanye's behavior the lenh of his manic state is markedly longer than what the manual says.

I'm unmedicated bipolar. I've been working hard at it, so stuffs not so severe now, but I could get manic for a few days to a week at time before I crash and get depressed for a month or so.
Their worst are still better than the other best. That is how they justify this kind of behavior. Once they can't win they will be happy to do away with representative democracy to win because no Democracy is still better than having a Democrat win. They are already rooting for totalitarianism. The media knew about this guy but they snuffed out the reporting because then they wouldn't have all this drama to report on. The medias ultimate goal is to make everything crazy because crazy is entertaining and entertainment keeps people tuned in and engaged. This is why things can't be left 100% up to private interests monopolizing content. With a private person owning Twitter now we will see this kind of thing happen more frequently. The campaign will pay more to Musk to keep news out of the public sphere than they will for campaigning on a message. Then you will just get ratfuckers acting like the other party and paying to keep that information from getting out. Once they win they can't be stopped. People will have no idea who they are voting for and they will stop caring about voting and just demand that peace (white people keeping what they deserve while everyone else is punished) be maintained. And then we will be at war with ourselves fighting over memes sent down from the Ministry of Information and enjoying our 3 minutes of hate each day.

I don't know. A country who goes nuts for wearing a cloth over their face during a pandemic but are happy for school rooms to have litter boxes for school shooting prep isn't right in it's head.

Actually doing something is political suicide. Things only get done because there are a few politicians who in good faith try to make the country better, or, are lobbied to do something with the lobbyists taking the heat (eg picking up any lost campaign funds etc) if any.

I'm not the sort of person to put politicians in one bag (some are lazy, some aren't; some are smart, some aren't) but there has been a trend to not legislate and instead push the decision to any other institution.
Do liberals suddenly not shop at Walmart anymore? Drive gas-powered automobiles or fly in airplanes? Use cellphones with rare metals in them? Eat foods harvested and ranched on lands laid waste for the sake of agriculture? Heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summers? Use electricity?
Now the mines are closed. Many hold resentment against those who support climate change because its the people pushing climate changes fault the coal mines closed. Yet when job retraining programs are offered the scoff at it because it's "not what our family does". They made a industry an identity and are now trapped by pride and "tradition". I have wasted so much breath trying to bring reasoning and factual conversation with people in this position but they won't have it. Most haven't even seen 50 miles from their home town. The kicker is you will hear things like "this has been happening for thousands of year, just let it happen".

There's a very interesting about this very issue. While a large portion of the public already no longer supports the war, there are other factions at play here. I hope Putin eventually falls due to this war, but it's not at all clear that that will happen. It will take more than just the loss of public support.
That of course doesn't mean Ukraine has to bow down to Russian demands to avoid further casulties but it's at least important to be aware of them, especially as "outsider" because it's easy to throw lives at the enemy you aren't "responsible" for and as much as people point out Russia's "wave tactics" and carelessness towards the lives of their own men, it should not be forgotten that Ukraine has to match that intensity and that comes with its cost too (and while I believe that Ukraine is doing better as defender overall, Ukraine's losses are also scary even if we take the more optimistic numbers).

Says who? In literally every war that Russia has fought, they lose ten of millions. I mean in WW2 they lost 27,000,000. Granted it’s not a World War, but I don’t think the Russians care.

It is money he mostly controlled, but it’s not 💯 fungible money - he can’t just spend it on hookers, it has to be laundered via some process (paying for hotel rooms at one of his shitty hotels, used as a hush payment etc) so there’s a significant discount on its value to him. It is interesting that he’d use that much, say, 20%-cash on something so dumb, but I think it’s explainable via 1) it’s a ballache to steal from his PAC 2) it was probably “spent” by one of his minions helping to enable what they imagine his idiotic fantasies are.

Up front? I’m surprised it wasn’t “do this audit for free, and ‘if’ you ‘find’ that I actually won, there’s a million (in donor money) for each of you in it.” (Followed by him not paying anyone.).

occupation/colonialism: the best argument anti israel clowns have is the occasional house being bulldozed in the west bank, or a wall being there which IS inconvenient, but again, an incredibly RESTRAINED response to rampant terrorism. the wall was put up in response to the second intifada which was busses, weddings, pizza parlors, etc being blown up by suicide bombers with rat poison/shrapnel strapped around them etc… again, no other country on earth, or in history, would have put up with that shit. britain, the real colonizers, basically tried to split the country in two when they pulled out, the jews accepted, the arabs didnt, they wageda surprise attack (on the primarily outnumbered holocaust survivors, on yom kippur, the holiest day of the year for jews) and lost, oops, ever since then they have played victims for “not being allowed back into their homes” which if the “right of return” was given to their now super inflated numbers, would immediately destroy the one functioning democracy in the middle east….

Yes? I replied to the commentor I quoted saying it's because a ton of redditors hate Jews - giving an explanation as to why there's so many commentors out here defending the attacks.

The only reason someone can support the attacks is if they hate those people and since the people targeted were Israeli Jews, then it's by no means a stretch to conclude that /u/charming-start-3722 hates Jews.
I won't lose a bit of sleep over this. Its just Russia saber-rattling trying to get the US/Ukraine to the bargaining table so that they can get a temporary ceasefire so that they can reorganize their troops for a renewed offensive in the spring.
Bro. You think we’ve been buying $500 hammers by the truckload for the last 30 years just to let Russia get a nuke off the ground? Always remember that the shit you see is what you’re allowed to see. We’ve been doing mystery missions in space, and I don’t think they’re science missions. While Russia was reeling from losing the Cold War, the U.S. economy was roaring ahead full throttle and compared to Russia, has never stopped. Russia is so fucking far behind us when it comes to military weapons and technology, it’s unbelievable. If they fuck around, they’re gonna find out, and I really hope they don’t because the Russian people will ultimately be the ones to pay for Putin’s misstep. They need to surgically remove him and his gang before shit gets to that point.
Also, if the commander who lives this everyday with intimate knowledge about his enemy’s tactics and such tells you it’s something they routinely observe and experience, you’re proving to everyone skeptical of your reporting standards that you’re trying to stir shit by giving your own “opinion” that tensions are “brewing”.
Nope. People like to play the America bad game and make false equivalencies and say “well what if this country encroached on our sovereign borders” without even understanding this this is typical Chinese imperialism, the same thing they’d critique the United States for.

Weird. The video I saw was more of American aircraft, you are approaching Chinese airspace and we will intercept you if you come any closer. And the American airplane responded with something like we will be maintaining distance. Chinese plane remained with American plane till the American plane veered away. There wasn't anything escalatory or de-escalating which seems to make more sense for such professional encounters. Both sides are highly trained pilots.

While I automatically disregard everything Fox News reports as a rule, I’ll give cnn consideration but with an automatic position of distrust and the default that they are deliberately manufacturing content designed to create outrage and fear partly due to money partly due to control.

Not sure what you mean. The story is about that single flight with CNN reporters on board (a recon aircraft, not a fighter). The referenced part is about the encounter with that specific ship, so it's probably the same person talking anyway.

Is it possible that both recorded and transcribed exchanges took place during the same encounter with the same ship? Certainly, but the way the OP article & video are edited, you are left wondering. Maybe video of one of the exchanges is not available, but the text article should provide more context.
I'm not underestimating him lol. He has the charisma of a wet fart. His culture war shit is only popular among the maga base. Millions of conservative voters have died in the pandemic and several million boomers are dying every year. Trump was the last gasp of a dying demographic. Also, yes, there are conservatives in blue states, that's not news. There are more republicans in California than any other state. It is not revelatory that you have relatives that would vote for him. So do I, it's anecdotal.

Also if the west was afraid of a conflict with russia why the fuck joining the conflict in all but declaration of war in the First Place? Theres many ways they could punish russia without causing nuclear war, in all likehood a few dead farmers Is not enough reason to declare war anyway or consider It an open Attack, its very obviously a mistake whoever committed It, nato would not have invoke article 5 even if It was actually a Russian missile and Who thinks otherwise Is a Little bit out of their minds.
Yes dude, they did. They immediately claimed it was a Russian attack and it took less then several hours for the west to conclude that it wasn't because they literally have all the military and spy tech in Europe and from satellites watching this war 24/7.

Just a person that use their own head. 2 - I agree in your point of the shopkeeper, but I don't see what is the connection with this incident. 3 - We had a missile strike in Poland that isn't in war. Two people died, and the final statement is "bad luck". 4 - And from my understanding of the final conclusion is that is all ok and the polands need to take it and comprehend that "bad things happen".

The "good" thing is that the people of Poland have nothing to worry about from now on. If they have another hit by a rogue missile is just bad luck and bad aiming from the Ukrainians.
The strategy is to go to war with progressives, the LGBTQ community and black history teachers. Hence we see the DeSantis playbook of defending good Christian families from the evil LGBTQ community, who are all pedophiles with no family values, and progressives, who promote critical race theory, Wokeness, ANTIFA and BLM, and violently attack Christians, trash their cities and want white people to pay endless retribution out of guilt for past wrongdoings they had nothing to do with. And all right-wing media is in lockstep with this message pumping propaganda 24/7 until it becomes accepted as common knowledge. Because any messages repeated often enough becomes truth.

Parallels are drawn between American politicians’ exploitation of Christian constituencies toward authoritarian ends and the relationships between religion and actual authoritarian/theocratic nations around the world.

One the one hand, I agree. On the other, I see a lot of parallels between him and Trump back in the 2016 campaign with how we’re kind of waving our hands saying “no way he’ll get in”. I am fucking concerned.
The stupidest part of this all is we're just going to repeat the clown show again when they vote on the rules. Even if we ignore that having any single member be able to move to recall the speaker is a very dumb idea that nobody wants, they appare tly negotiated that a bunch of the crazies get committee chairs outright? Why would the person who was going to get that committee chair vote for those rules?

They saw the Russian jets pathetic performance in Ukraine. The Russians can't use their own plane in their current war against a smaller neighbor with a much smaller air force. Russian military equipment is garbage and the SU-35 is no exception. A lot of countries cancelled orders for Russian military equipment after seeing the extremely poor performance of the weapons in Ukraine. The US doesn't care about who buys the SU-35 because it's not a real threat in combat. It's great for killing unarmed civilians and keeping megalomaniacal dictators in power. It will be a perfect fit for Iran as long as those idiots keep them aimed at their own unarmed civilian population and don't try to point them at Israel where they will be quickly destroyed. Khamenei has been struggling to repress the women of Iran. Maybe this will do the trick.
It's not a superb fighter by western standards or by nations that can manufacture their own aircraft while keeping the sensitive upgrades, but for nations that can't make their own and are not in any alliances to get things like the F35 or specialty F16s like the Indian F21, it's the best on the open market.

I think it first got stuck under Trump. But Egypt wants US and French aircraft more now for whatever reason.
Meat for the grinder. Their current strategy seems to be simply to wear down Ukraine's will to fight. So they'll throw however many bodies they need at Ukraine to make advancing hard. No matter how poorly equipped, it's still not easy to just beat thousands of soldiers.
I see this as originally being Russia creating a frozen conflict zone to ensure Ukraine can not join NATO and is limited in its abilities to gain investment/resources while Russia tries to create the political conditions for another pro-Russian candidate to take power (historically in Ukraine candidates would alternate between pro-EU and pro-Russian). However, it became pretty apparent that Ukraine would no longer alternate like that and firmly had aims of joining the EU and aligning itself away from Russia.

There is of course strategic utility in capturing Ukraine, but I would caution against assuming that there is a fully rational explanation for Putin's actions. It would be absurd for any average, well-adjusted person to launch a massive invasion that has truly hurt their nation because of ideological beliefs, but Putin is not rational and his age/COVID have not helped. He is a former KGB agent, it is well known that these people are very conspiratorial and paranoid.

Industry? Try and get what you can as the whole region gets pummelled by Ukrainian artillery and you send all the workers in the region to die.
In France it was a different story, a massive number of reactors were built giving an efficiency of production, leading France to have some of the cheapest electricity in the world, and certainly in Europe. The cost per kWh of electricity in the UK is around $0.41 USD, and in Germany it's $0.53 USD. Compare this to France which is $0.21 USD - nearly half the cost of UK, and 2.5 times lower than Germany, thanks to Nuclear! Some "failure".
I agree with you that the Greens are currently the only party that behave properly in the Ukraine war, and that especially the SPD is a major disgrace in this conflict, but this does not negate that the Green use the anti-nuclear position as their foundation myth and because of that, are vehemtly against any new evidence that Nuclear might have become safer and more sustainable since the 1970s.

Thank you! Glad to see someone gets it. Germany decided to be so unfathomably stupid and there's usually a price to pay for stupidity. They're part of an alliance that aims to check Russia's aggression and yet they were paying billions every year to the country and the dictator they wanted protection against.

Dude. I keep telling people he is just a filler trying to pivot how bad trump was. Just so trump can run again. Santos eats glue but trump wants to keep your guns. This is a dirty parlay.

Myers seems to be a terrible journalist who is dogged by accusations of unethical and dishonest behaviour, he claims to be good buddies with Vish Burra, the convicted drug dealer and MAGA swamp monster who became Director of Operations for Santos after Santos was accused of fabricating almost his entire history (when asked if Santos' scandals around his lies and campaign finance issues played a part in Burra wanting to work for Santos he said "Of course, thats my brand").

Agreed. The House GOP is one big magic show and we need to pay attention to what the other hand is doing. At the end of the day, Santos is just another automatic vote for the MAGA agenda and isn’t worth the attention. He didn’t get to where he is to do the right thing.

I do not condone any of Russias actions. There is no kind of justification for any offensive war. Still, deliberately threatening your neighbour (by joining N.A.T.O. and installing missle systems next to the Russian border) is definitiv a rather unresponsible move in regards to the safety of the people of your own country and the other country aswell. The U.S.A. are even more to blame, as they knowingly and openly persue an agenda of world hegemony, when peace demands for a balance of power. This however does not mean that Russia (and in another contexts China) isn't driven by the same notion. Ofc in this case, the main responsibility lies with Russia for escalating the conflict. But if nations don't learn to leave the others the fuck alone than thousands upon thousands will die, be harmed, traumatized and live in poverty just because of this stupid attitude.
Really? Point out the part where Zelensky’s national pride forced Putin to send his army to go kill ukrainians. Or did your dear podcaster conveniently have no explanation for that leap of logic.
1200 random people, most with zero experience in climatology. My favorites are the IT consultant, the radiologist MD (I'm an ophthalmologist and it would be fucking hilarious if I ever ended up on a publication like this even though I majored in physical sciences), a lawyer with no science background, the microwave \[oven\] specialist, the professor of hematology who couldn't quite tough it out to become an actual hematologist, the software specialist, the former CFO of a bank (they don't sound financially driven at all...except that is what the F stands for), the CEO of Dutch supermarkets, and the multiple people (such as Dick Leppky, Retired businessman and Independent Truth Seeker) who didn't put their actual title because they are at least smart enough to know it would degrade and embarrass their pathetic efforts further.
This sounds stupid. I get that CO2 has natural benefits but if these scientists want to provide the greatest benefit to life itself then surely they should appreciate that 1) not putting excess CO2 into a system that has worked well without it would be ideal and 2) not every species survives every climate cycle, and the point of our intervention now is for us to be one of those that survive.
>And can there be entertained a reasonable doubt but the provisions of the act import a restraint on the right of the citizens to bear arms? The court apprehends not. The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.

They want the worlds biggest bully to help them, the bully that uses their big stick, often with lethal consequences, as well as sanctions to beat other countries into submission, the bully that meddles in most countries internal affairs and builds bases worldwide to wall in their perceived foes, as opposed to the other bully that mostly only saber rattles.
Oh, sure. It's just people "moving". That is that what you call relegating indigenous population to a racist apartheid system of indefinite occupation and ethnic cleansing these days? How cute.

Palestinians aren't being exterminated! And glad you think it's sufficient foR Jews to just "get by" in the US. Why can't people be ok with Jews having an actual country where they are safe. Rather than be a minority where their safety is at the discretion of others. Things can quickly change. Jews were briefly safe in Germany until it wasnt.

You mean the Germany that tried to kill every single Jew? Or the Europe that was complicit in that or actively helped? How about the rampant antisemitism in Europe and elsewhere.
This unwillingness to help anyone but the upper class and the corporate world really cuts against their ability to win over enough people to go fully authoritarian. Hating on the trans community and immigrants is enough to win over a certain chunk of the population, but they can't win over the people that would be willing to hold their nose and go along for the ride in exchange for economic relief. We know that lots of billionaires and business leaders personally hated Trump but supported him because of tax cuts. We know that the evangelicals supported him to create the horrible SCOTUS we are left with. We know he got the gun nut crowd because he was a 2A supporter and he got the conspiracy crowd because someone finally paid attention to them. But Trump offered little to nothing for average middle class Americans and when it boils down to it, he might have won re-election if he had.

According to George W. Bush he got “Mission Accomplished” and even landed on an aircraft carrier to declare it. From a military perspective the US did beat the Iraqi military hands down. That can’t be disputed at all. L. Paul Bremmer on the other hand lost the peace by disbanding the military and isolating the Baathist party who were the only people who knew how to keep the country functioning. This created massive civil unrest and eventually an insurgency which was partially ended by electing a prime minister and seating a president as well as a legislative body. The elected body in Iraq asked the US to leave and tone down their involvement in their domestic affairs. The US was not pushed out militarily. Additionally that same legislative body requested the US come back and help them when Daesh/IS/ISIL exploded onto the population.

Condemn evil, violence and hatred wherever the source is, no more finger pointing or picking sides. When Israel commits evil call it out, When Hamas does something shitty then call it out. All enemies of peace should be shamed.
The United Nations, international human rights organizations and many legal scholars regard the Gaza Strip to still be under military occupation by Israel.\[5\] This is disputed by Israel and other legal scholars.\[6\] Following the withdrawal, Israel has continued to maintain direct control over Gaza's air and maritime space, and six of Gaza's seven land crossings, it maintains a no-go buffer zone within the territory, and controls the Palestinian population registry, and Gaza remains dependent on Israel for its water, electricity, telecommunications, and other utilities.\[5\]\[7\].

Yes. The IDF actually takes active and pretty extreme measures to protect Palestinian life, while Hamas throws them to die on purpose so that dumb sheltered westerners will support it.

Yes. It won't be too long before Florida parents, for instance, find that their kids can't get into the colleges they want. And those middle to upper class moms and dads have always been a reliable vote for Republicans. Most of this culture war stuff hasn't affected them at all - but this will.

MAGA Republicans repudiate even conservative leaning news media. If the information is not presented as what they want to hear then it is dismissed. RINO's are anyone that accepts reality, facts and truth and questions anything the party crazies spout. I don't know how these people even get into office. Perhaps it's a wellspring of the most highly uneducated being inspired to vote and thus, embracing the education culture war.
Yeah. Nobody said NK's weapons were good. Just that they made them (and a good number of them). Sometimes cheap and plentiful has its own level of impact.
Exactly. I was reading Oksana Zabuzjko about 6 months ago.. now I'm considering reading it again just to wrap my head around all the surprising history of Ukraine.

Absolutely agree. I don't think NATO/the West would preemptively attack. So, it's a matter of counterattack after a Russian 1st strike. That 1st strike has the potential to be devastating. So, it's a classic situation of mutually assured destruction to some extent. If Russia doesn't wipe out conventional western forces, then we'd likely strike in force with conventional forces in response to a low yield nuke. If it was a widespread attack that severely limited conventional forces, then you'd likely see a direct nuclear response. Either way, it's a scary scenario for all.
I want an unbiased article that actually gives me factual information. I'm not asking them to insult their views. But they should present the opposite viewpoint coming from scientific understanding of bee behaviour for example. They should provide counterpoints both ways and talk about these being traditional views that run counter to expert advise but also that these views have long standing tradition so it's understandable that they ignore advice. And they should go into more detail of how they are usually handled and why it went wrong this time (if this is unusual). It's important to highlight these details. The article is essentially a presentation of quotes and beliefs with no actual substance. It's lazy and poor writing.
But large proportions of westerners (especially in the US) will go to church on Sunday, actually believe that there is a supernatural being that is responsible for their fortune and misfortune, and that there is an actual heaven where certain people ascended and where people will go in an afterlife. And will hold the view above about other beliefs being ridiculous, with no irony whatsoever.
Sorry but that's too easy an explanation. A better explanation is too many Republicans sat on their ass and allow The Crazies to take over the party. It's that old adage of first they came for X then they came for Y and then when they came for me there was nobody left to speak out. The Republicans allowed Donald Trump The Big Lie, election deniers, Lauren Boebert, MarjorieTaylor Greene and the other nut jobs to be their voices. They allowed Donald Trump to hand pick the nut jobs and now they're trying to say it's because the Democrats supported those people they made them easier to beat. I think even if the Democrats hadn't supported those crazies a lot of them would have won because that's who the Republicans choose in their primaries not thinking about who is more centrist and can build a bridge. Republicans build walls and then wonder why they lose. They need to look in the mirror we need to go back to the winning party gets 60% and the loser gets 40%. Not as Newt Gingrich instituted 100% to 0 and if you don't like it that's too bad.

Sure, but only from my own frustration as a voter and tax payer. There has been a lot of discretionary spending in this year alone that have real world price tags attached to them that the “just raise the debt ceiling” crowd seems to fail to account for. Forgive college loans you say then call everyone that asked how it gets paid for assholes for asking how it gets paid for. Blanket donate hundreds of billions of dollars to the military industrial complex so as to equip Ukraine. Again the mere suggestion that it’s not our war and we’re labeled as Nazi sympathizers. Then there is the 7000 page omnibus bill to the tune of trillions rammed through congress in 48 hours notably without republican input. Who here can read 7000 pages of legal documents in less than 48 hours? By all means don’t acknowledge any of that and just say “just raise the debt ceiling or you’re a piece of shit that wants to burn the whole country down”. All it’s doing is mortgaging our great great great great grandchildren’s futures. The money doesn’t just go nowhere. You don’t want the republicans to cut Medicaid and social security then stop making them have to consider it just so you can get your college paid for when you agreed to the financing. These are only three examples of course there are more than I can ever point out.

Very cool. An apple is highly biodegrabable. Something that takes 15 years isn't. 10 000 years is nothing in the grand scheme of things either and we wouldn't refer to something that takes 10 000 to be highly-biodegradable.
No car crash deaths! Lots of deaths caused by blood loss and cranial trauma, however. Completely unrelated, I assure you. Safest roads in the world. Everyone says so.
For 3 years China was controlling covid to such an extreme that if one person tested positive, everyone they interacted with AND everyone the interacted people interacted with were unwilling forced into quarantines for 2 weeks where they were constantly tested. Some things got ridiculous, like Ikeas shutting down with everyone inside and Disneyland Shanghai being shut down with everyone inside. Entire hospitals got shut down for days just because of 1 case. It kept covid from hitting the general population, but also merely delayed the inevitable with no end goal. For a long time no one dared protest because it meant prison time in China, but after 3 years people got pissed and started protesting in multiple cities and finally the government backtracked. But they went from extreme dystopian measures to suddenly none at all with no middle ground, so covid hit a vulnerable population all at once and no one had the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines because the Chinese government forbade it out of arrogance that their own COVID vaccine, Sinovac, is better (it isn't) so China is being hit with the first wave right now, all at once with no restrictions. At least it's omicron and not the earlier variants.

Litigating of individual ballots. If 50,000 people voted and the election came down to just one or two votes that means there are probably about a dozen votes where it was somewhat unclear how the person who voted filled them out. After the recount the campaigns will find the ballots that could arguably count for them and litigate those ballots as well as try to sue any ballots which arguably might not count that are in support of the other candidate. If a race really does come down to one or two voted litigation of the controversial ballots is the next step after the recount.
So my understanding of it from what I can remember is that either house (House of Representatives or Senate) can propose bills, if it passes one, it goes to the other. It has to pass both, then it can go on to be either signed into law by the President, essentially a promise to execute/enforce the now law, or vetoed. If the President signs it then it goes on to the Supreme Court who in theory checks the law for Constitutionality. If they find that there’s something in there that goes outside the roles of the federal government then they send it back to the people who drafted the bill to be modified. If the President vetos something similar happens unless you can get a supermajority (iirc 67% or 2/3) in the Senate. Someone who’s had to examine the structure more recently than 5 years ago should fact check me on this but that’s how I remember it working. If I’m right this means the Senate is the house with the right to overrule a presidential veto. I don’t remember if the Senate can overrule a SC veto but I think not.
Riiiiiiight. The timing has nothing to do with the midterms shifting more blue than expected. It's not like they were hoping for their Red friends across the pond to win some elections and leave Ukraine to die right?

Again, factually incorrect. My last comment is factually correct. The only way it would/could be moved to federal court is if the DOJ seeks that resolution. Based on there being absolutely no evidence they are pursuing that investigation, believing that will occur is quite an exercise in fantasy.

Did they not also claim this through the DoD after saying it was too expensive to run earlier on in the war after Musk fell out with the foreign minister? (Another interesting avenue of reimbursement if this was suppposed to be humanitarian aid).

Its literally his philosophy that its better to make quick decisions and then later reverse it than to not take the decision at all with the belief that most decisions you make are not going to be so catastrophic that you can't back out. Twitter is the one incident where he got it very wrong. And possibly this one as well.
Honest question, do you really think a Biden presidency or a Harris Presidency would be much different? People put way too much on the actual person when the politics of the party are the more important factor. The messaging might be a little different, but Harris is not going to do anything drastically different from Biden if something were to happen to Biden. The difference is Biden has such a I’m 80 years old I don’t have any shits to give that a younger person doesn’t have. He literally does what the majority of the dem party wants. Now you can agree or disagree with the politics of the party itself, but the fact is the person if they are not on the fringes of the party is irrelevant for the most part.

He's relatively moderate Dem that's not particularly exciting. Even his wins have been impressive given the partisan politics but overwhelming not that great overall.
My friend it’s happening, in fact it’s happening right now... I spent half my adult life in the US Army, still have friends who are in and we talk. Lots of interesting things going on inside Poland and Romania right now! 😎.
Putin is unlikely to resort to the use of a tactical nuclear weapon (or a radiological attack of some sort perhaps), but seeing missiles coming down on Moscow is one great way to make him seriously consider it.

No NATO country is likely to be willing to let Ukraine get missiles with that sort of range, for fear Russia will see this as a massive escalation and respond accordingly. Hitting targets in Crimea is one thing, but being able to hit Moscow is another thing entirely.

The comment you replied to was one where I suggested it would be nice to see Ukraine able to hit central Moscow as a response to missile attacks on their cities.

This isn't going to happen, but it would be nice to see Ukraine able to publicly tell the Russians that every missile that hits Kyiv will see a response aimed at central Moscow. Perhaps after destroying the Kerch bridge to make a point.
Not gonna lie. I hope he's suffering unimaginable pain and humiliation. I hope he realizes that the world knows that he shits himself because he's rotted from the inside, and everytime we see him, we'll be wondering if he's wearing a diaper. I hope that thought burns his soul.
So I’m not saying some schools don’t have funding issues because that’d be stupid to say because a lot of them do, but I’m saying bad teachers are almost universal in the US education system, and that it’s often absolutely filled to the brim with sexual predators that we havnt properly vetted and removed. (Similar abuse rates in public schools as the Catholic Church but no one ever talks about it). It’s almost impossible to fire a government employee unless they say something racist or get caught doing something horrific. Here’s something you may agree with, it’s also way too difficult firing bad cops. Also once again if we spent money here in the US that would previously have been spent elsewhere, the schools would get more funding.
So no, you couldn’t argue that. They intended to kill them. They weren’t merely okay with letting them die, they actively exterminated them. You could maybe make the argument for other groups that were victims of the holocaust? But then the question isn’t “did the Nazis commit genocide” but “against exactly which groups did the Nazis commit genocide”.
Assuming prescriptive linguistics, we can’t disagree on if a given action, carried out with a given intent, was genocide.

He completely failed in my eyes as a UK citizen. I'm so pleased he helped you guys in Ukraine but here in the UK he was nothing but a lying cheat. I won't give him the time of day to be honest. He's an absolute conman.
To be fair many European nations danced a knifes edge with supporting Russia and hoping it would "come around", and I imagine it was in no small part due to the possibility of shifting energy dependence closer to home(without the ugliness of producing it actually at home).

Who even are you? Have you lived under a fuking rock for the past year or something? Boris is a criminal. No, get your head out your arse, he doesn’t care for Ukraine but instead used it as a means to try to improve his PR amid a slurry of scandals that around over the course of over year.

Exactly. It is also worth pointing out that the British military have been helping to train the Ukrainian army way before Johnson was PM. British military trainers have been in Ukraine since 2014 I think, helping to build up the skills and weapon knowledge.
Again if a Party's main contributor is George Soros the Nazi Collaborator who participated in murdering thousands of Jews and destroyed Governments in Europe why would you think he is a good guy and accept him as your main source of Political contributions ....come on Granny explain this one? But us Republicans know how he and the Nazi's cast blame on innocent Jews to have them thrown in Concentration camps, Then your Democrat Partymoney trickles to Antifa, and the scam group called Black lives Matter geewiz sweet granny how many radical groups can your beautiful Democrats cling to?
Now this is an example of how much hate dems have, there are no Trump nazi's, none, Hitler was a socialist and ran the National socialist Party similar to modern-day Democrats, everything the radical left believes is what they blame others for.

It's like Trumpian "winning". If you refuse to admit a loss, you can keep claiming victory even when someone else wins. It doesn't matter that reality gives the true winner the office and the title. You just keep claiming whatever it is you want, and keep telling constituents you won, even if it's from the back of a cop car on the way to jail. People laugh about George Santos, but he is only living the shameless life of a loser who won. And even if he loses in the future, he can still claim he won. This makes things so much easier I could never have gotten in to medical school, but according to their model, I can just call myself Doctor and start sending bills to Medicare. I'm set for life.
… isn’t just being a Republican a humiliation? Isn’t “republican” just another word for “struggles to define reality” ? It’s not really a functional political party or working off a functional developed and evolved political strategy so being Republican really means you’re “lost in the world with no other employable skills”.

wait a minute, don't forget I was already President, the Greatest President We've Ever Had, and I know nothing about Anti Semites, I know nothing about Fuentes, Nick Fuentes, and they were brought by Ye, Kanye West, who I do know very well, and I have to say they did have Total Respect for me so why would I say anything bad, all I'm saying is I knew nothing about it, it had nothing to do with me, but you would never know that with how the Fake News is acting.

I've done more for Semites, more for our Country than anybody, but they don't wanna talk about that, and I've done probably more in terms of Administration and Being President that people can't even believe it, even the King Of The Fake News CNN had to say, "Trump is so Presidential," and I knew for a long long time that I could either be Movie Star or President, maybe both who knows, and we'll see what happens. I have The Look, I have the Star Power, and I'm also Incredibly Rich, and they wanted me to give it up, don't forget the Democrats said I couldn't be President and do Business at the same time, but I did both way way better than Obama ever could, even better than Reagan. Ronald Reagan, he used to be a Governor before he was President, not a lot of people know that.

Do their citizens think they Khamenei needs a nuke? Would this not completely and fully entrench his power? Will they feel such a strike like this unjustified? Lots of questions but i think your line of thinking would hardly apply.
“According the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Israel’s cumulative investments in the United States through 2013 are more than economic giants like China, India, Russia, Hong Kong, and Brazil, not to mention major oil producer Venezuela, mutual defense treaty partner Taiwan, and all of Africa’s individual countries.”.

No friend. Just one. Called ww3. Once this happens, if it happens, it will increase tensions and escalate existing conflicts. If China supports Russia militarily that could do it also. I think Biden sucks but he has kept us from ww3 so far.

Regional rivalry. Before Iraq was crushed by the US Iran and Israel were pretty close, despite the same ideological differences as today, Israel even lobbied the US to restore political ties with Iran, sold US weapons to Iran against the US' will. After the First Gulf War Iraq was no longer a threat; Iran and Israel were the two most powerful countries in the region, both interested in dominating/controlling the Middle East.
Where was this when he said White Supremacists were very fine people? Where was this when he said Mexicans were rapists and murderers? Where was this when he tried to ban Muslims from entering the country? Shithole countries? Every single time Trump showed us his true colors Republicans circled the wagons around him and protected and defended and excused him. They should ALL go down when he flames out. Any one of them who voted not to impeach a cheater, liar and traitor. Any one of them who voted not to certify the election. Any one of them who couldn't stand up to joke of a "president" because they were afraid. Every. single. one.

The turtle flops more than a fish out of water. He spoke against Trump's 1/6 attempt to over throw the government on the house floor then started back peddling almost immediately. Always take what this fuck says with a grain of salt.

Increased funding doesn't just go to lining cops' pockets (though it also does that), it also goes to getting technological updates (new ways to spy on innocent people), new equipment (new ways to kill innocent people) and facilities (new ways to imprison innocent people).

Why not have both? Think of all the responsibilities we lump onto police officers, they're expected to be experts in like 20 different things, maybe that's not realistic? Maybe not every call needs an armed officer?

We are at the beginning of finding out just how much long-term damage Trumpism is going to do to this country. Trump was successful in a couple of things. He was successful in exposing the fact that there are a lot more racists and bigots in this country than anybody was comfortable admitting to, even if they knew it privately. He was successful in coralling them into a voting bloc that reshaped the GOP and in many cases can no longer be ignored due to its sheer size. He was successful in showing us that continuing to push the envelope as far to the right as possible, then pushing it further, is a viable pathway to victory in some areas. And he was successful in showing us that our government really doesn't have an answer when someone like Trump comes along and says "So What? What are you going to do about it?".
Trump also tried to dismantle the Federal executive, installed his family and friends at the highest levels of government, appointed extremist judges and justices, colluded against our Allie's with Russia, took money from foreign governments, raided the coffers for his family and cronies, etc. You don't think DeSantis can do more damage than that?

Sorry. Fifty years of voting has brought nothing to people like me. Oh, I’m still gonna vote D — and that makes me even more furious. I saw Dick Nixon resign August 1974 In the 50 intervening years, the Democrats have fumbled every play. WE DO NOT HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE Billionaires do not pay their fair share of taxes The War on Drugs The constant wars of imperialism all over the globe AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE of every American The Supreme Court! It’s difficult for me to breathe sometimes when I think about how weak and defenseless the Democrats are, how feckless they have always been, and how they do nothing for people who work for a living. Save your innocuous platitudes for someone with hope. I ain’t got none. Democrats suck and Republicans are theocratic fascists. Goody.
Oh. Republicans are totally coherent to themselves — you don’t resonate with what they want, and you’re hoping Republicans don’t matter, but they do. Republicans have gotten everything: the Supreme Court is now a religious body; we are failing to confront Russia because the Rs want us to BECOME Russia; our global climate is destroyed. You may think it’s not too late, but it is. The Rs have totally destroyed the wall between church and state. It’s just worse and worse after this. Sorry! I have voted against them since 1972, but they have won.

I was briefly coworkers with someone who had served as a mayor in a small town. He told me that winning elections was easy. You just find a problem, and hang it on the incumbent. He found a playground that was a little rundown and portrayed it as a dangerous deathtrap. Incumbent accuses him of exaggerating (which he was) then "You don't care about the safety of our kids!" Local news eats it up because they are desperate for a scandal. When the mayor decides to get the park fixed, coworker balked at the cost, and claimed it was graft. Another candidate proposed something cheaper, and was "cheaping out on our kids." He claims no one really pushed him on the inconsistency because he would just ignore questions and pivot to accusations, and hey, content is content to mediocre journalists. I asked him for his policy on theplayground and his actual words were "I didn't have one. Policy proposals are for suckers. They make you vulnerable. People will always find problems with them.".

Eastern Europeans figured out centuries ago how to get through long winters on stored food. Grain keeps naturally as long as rodents are kept out. They also rely heavily on root vegetables like beets and turnips, which keep naturally in a root cellar. Ukraine's national dish is borsch- beet soup. They have a great enthusiasm for foraged mushrooms in fall, which are a source of vitamin D, at a time of year when the sun's UV light is too weak to provide much to the skin. Pickled and lacto- fermented foods like sauerkraut are sources of nutrients that don't endure cooking well, like vitamin C. They even turn dried tea and white sugar into kombucha, which is rich in B vitamins.

Really? Because when millions of tons of free food was delivered to Ethiopia in the 80s the dictator still allowed famine to last. Go find any famine in the last century that wasnt due largely to geopolitical reasons.
The CBO’s black-box model is bullshit, and their need to calculate things in profit/losses is detrimental to society. I’m honestly not sure they’ve ever been correct, in hindsight, in their assessments. In fact, a lot of their findings seem to conveniently line up with “truths” that are derived from, what we now know to be, bullshit economics. If we’re ever going to move beyond “trickle-down” economic ideas, we’re going to have to come to the understanding that good economic decisions might cost money, because some things are worth taking “financial” “losses” on, for example; equality. But government debt and deficits don’t really work like that, with “losses” or “profit”. A governments deficit is societies surplus, that money isn’t gone, it’s out circulating, doing things (in healthy economies) and again, there are more important things for a healthy society than the the “profit” of government investments…like;, people having access to affordable healthcare, homes, education, roads, equality in all aspects of life (especially financial), and ensuring that businesses don’t destroy the only habitable planet we have access to. We shouldn’t put a price tag in those things. Economics is all made up. We’ve bound ourselves to rules that we could just as easily toss out the window. The current form of the system only benefits a few.

Sorry for the seemingly nitpick but western people have a tendency for bothsidesism and false equivalency when it comes to the conflict. There’s a big difference between Artsakh being a a landlocked enclave completely within Azerbaijan fighting for their existence and Nakhichevan being a exclave separated from the mainland but still having a border with Turkey and land connection through Iran and not having to deal with any threats from Armenia whatsoever.
The CSTO is such a useless alliance. Even Kazakhstan gave up on it when it started sharing CSTO intelligence with turkey and turkey planning to establish drone manufacturing facilities in Kazakhstan. It even supported Azerbaijan in its war with Armenia and is looking to escape Russias influence over its energy sector by talking with Azerbaijan over building a pipeline.

Not quite. It was done to give Russia geopolitical allies on its borders and maintain existing trade relationships. But the relationship has always been Russia sending in troops to help its allies, and never its allies sending in troops to help them. If there was no war in Ukraine there would also be no conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Russia would have sent troops to Armenia to push the Azerbaijanis back.
Well, I think at the outset of the conflict there was a general perception that the US tends to sideline Europe in many situations. Instead of going in and the US doing whatever it wanted, disregarding European repercussions, Biden told Europe, effectively, that "this war is on your continent, we'll support you in whatever it is that you want to do though here's what we think should be done.".
Ofc I think Germany could have prepared more before the war and taken more action faster since in a more unified way, but 1) have to recognize the massive steps taken that would be unthinkable a year ago, 2) it does genuinely seem like the PiS party in Poland has a secondary goal, after supporting Ukraine, of making Germany look bad and specifically conducts diplomacy (from open statements to press to formal requests (or lack thereof)) in this manner.

Everyone was laughing. Because nobody thought that decades and decades of economic ties would be thrown into the dumpster by Putin. Ties that were designed to stop aggression. The same ties that made the EU work.
I learned this about Ukraine a while back and I think it was Mila Kunis who said it and I knew about it since. It's easy for some to make the mistake as back then I had no idea either. But when ppl see others say it the respectfully correct them. It's an offensive way to refer to Ukraine and is an old soviet term and minimizes the legitimacy of them being a free independent country but rather some lesser. Similar to how ppl correct others when they use the Russian / soviet spelling of Kyiv and say Kiev. Ukraine uses neither and so when they get referred to in those ways it's derogatory and not respectful. But again, it can be made by accident by those that don't know and ppl will just point it out so they know foe future. That's one reason why fox news is so offensice is they can't even spell Kyiv right and use the spelling the own ppl use but rather chooses to dismiss them.
Absolutely. That decision is up to the Ukrainians and right now they seem rather busy defending their country from an invading genocidal army.
Although Russia is at war with Ukraine.. I love the skaters like, OMG I cannot, they are absolutely beautiful at skating especially, Kamila Valieva. But, IOC should suspend them because of the war, it would be improper if they didn't, but it would also break my poor little heart not to see them skate; They are at war, but suspending Russia's team, (that has absolutely nothing to do with Russia's war) is just like Okay, I can see the reasons and it's fine, but it's literally people that have absolutely no role in the war, it's the nation as a whole that's at war. The war has two sides legit and I don't think people see that Putin is the leader and is just forcing them to vote for him as a leader; Most Russians don't even want the war, it's just their lunatic president ( and some people that are crazy AF ). In my honest opinion, is that they should be suspended, and if the IOC wants to suspend them, they can, it's fine, but like in the end, it's up to the countries and the IOC to come to agreement. (As an America/Russian and other DNA mixed in, I am in between here, I absolutely Okay with this, I will see get to see my home country play (USA), but it also hurts me 'cause I wanna see Russia's Skaters and others play, but is okay-ish for me).
None of these. I just do not think politics should be interjected into the Olympics. If you are going to ban Russia, you should ban all the aggressors in military conflicts right now.

Totally disagree. Russians have been caught and proven to be cheating as an entire team. It's all 100% politics fir Putin. He uses the athletes for nationalistic propaganda. Any Russian winning a medal will be used for propaganda when many Ukrainian athletes most likely to be fighting. If they are not prepared to leave or push back on the regime then they have to accept being Russian has consequences when a regime like Putins is allowed to rule.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I hope so. As a Florida resident I cannot find any redeeming qualities in him. He is genuinely dangerous, and him elected president truly terrifies me at the amount of destruction he can cause. He has a way of weaponizing the office in a way that reminds me of a fascist dictator. If he’s elected president it would be catastrophic for the US.

Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.[16].

Totally different war. That’s like saying because we can’t wipe the rot off and apple, we can’t wipe the dust off it. In Afghanistan we were fighting a pointless war against a frequently invisible enemy. It was hard to know who was friend and who was for until they started shooting. It was also a war that wasn’t really able to be won because you can’t defeat ideology. Russia on the other hand will be people, in uniforms, on a battlefield, and it’s also the _exact_ war our military has spent decades and decades preparing for, training for, building technology designed exactly to defeat.

Honestly? No. The US Navy and air force are so insane and the Pacific so large I can't see anyone attempting it. China would be content to win a decisive victory in the south China sea and simply kick the US out I think.
Ten years ago the Ukrainian government made a decision based on staying close to Russia and their ideals instead of an economic decision to become closer to Europe. Then the citizens of Ukraine got rid of that government and now they aren’t just economically tied to Europe but ideologically too. It isn’t as black as white as ‘lol economics will never affect russias decisions’ hell they are losing this war so badly partly because of their economic circumstances. I don’t know how anyone looks at this situation and thinks Putin is playing some 4d chess that Europe can’t understand… I think it’s pretty clear that Europe is the powerhouse and it is putin who misjudged and misunderstood Europe, and it is much more costly for him to misunderstand Europe than it is for Europe to misunderstand him who. It is less like putin is a mastermind and Europe a victim, more like Europe is a parent tired of dealing with the little stroppy boy that is putin.
Totally. But click bait title to the max. Putin murders people all the time. His own people. But an outburst this is not. It’s cold and cruel but I have more an outburst when my headphone cables get tangled.
Why? The good news is we only need less vaccine than covid because people will catch it on purpose for "freedom." If it is deadly just dig a couple mass graves and toss the trash in there. It'll save us a lot more time and money that way.
I have a science degree in Ecological evolutionary and organismal biology as well as a science degree in Environmental studies. There are plenty of sources regarding population dynamics/biology and infectious disease. Ill throw a few for you to read based on various illness/diseases. Hope you actually read them. These are based on our species in the modern era. Doesn’t take a genius to observe in nature though. If you plant a field of wheat without fungicide or any gmo strains you will quickly see many fungal, bacterial, and viral infections run rampant in said field as well as insect damage. This is because it is unnatural. Nature doesn’t like monoculture. Hell look at CWD in deer populations. Cwd is a prion disease but I believe it is due to high numbers of deer in North America.
In the N. Carolina crash both bombs were found partially armed. In Spain two of the bombs detonated (conventional explosives) and spread plutonium around the area, basically a dirty bomb. Scary stuff.
When this popped up on BBC, in the context of Rishi Sunaks government getting a hammering I couldn't help but think if this is A) him trying to garner favour by taking headlines off Zahawi or B) if this is him trying to stay relevant for a leadership bid, same as his recent trip to Ukraine to beg Zelensky to endorse him, it's the only part of his PM legacy that positive and he's hammering it.

I doubt that would have happened. Soviet Russia lost wars against small and middle sized countries like Finland and Poland. And Russia really suffered from the German invasion. Without Lend and Lease and American resources, it would have been even worse for them. Russia has infinite Ressourcen, but its state is too corrupt to sustain long wars outside their territory. They can bully small bordering states, but that is all.
This is correct. The government is the issuer of currency. They can create as much as they want to fund fiscal spending. The only limiting factor is that creating money causes dilution of value of the currency, leading to inflation. Therefore when the government creates money for fiscal spending, it must also destroy money by taxation. The refusal to tax the wealthy sufficiently to allow necessary fiscal spending without causing inflation is absolutely a decision made by the government, and not caused by any external factor as they would like you to believe. The cause of the crisis in the NHS is the simply the refusal to tax the rich adequately. Furthermore, the rich are able to escape tax entirely by using offshore tax havens, as Sunak does himself. The reluctance to tax the rich is hardly surprising when the Prime Minister is one of the richest people in the country, benefitting personally from loopholes in the system over which he presides. The conflict of interest is clear. He must be removed.
You could argue it the other way; if you transferred all their wealth to the wider population, there would be a huge spike in inflation as everyone is awash with cash and wants to buy lots regardless of the price, so prices go up and very soon everyone feels poor again as a new baseline has been established. This is why the government wants to avoid everyone getting a payrise now. It will simply mean a new normal and more inflation.
Per usual, deflecting from the statement. So easily predictable. And, darlin’, I could give a big pile of bull butter whether you take me seriously or not. I am assuming you are unable to embrace diversity or thoughts that deviate from your own. Expected. Rather, what matters is that we as a nation begin to call a spade, a spade and investigate across the board, across the aisle, and in our own aisle if necessary. And, I might add, when investigations are complete, let’s go back and review them rather than shoving them down the news cycle. Let’s bring back to media circus table the once big voices who were shown to be right and wrong. Nah boo, you don’t have to take me seriously because as a southern woman of color you feel my use of the word “darlin” doesn’t jive with your “fancy”vocabulary. But you will take me seriously as educated, politically aware researcher who just dropped the mic…youmadohyoubigmad.

Given they cannot directly translate money into war material they rely on internal production. Production can be influenced by converted industry, extra work hours, more efficient methods. Currently I would imagine there is alot of pressure on people to work those extra hours with out compensation in money. This will work for a while due to the terror and propaganda control the government has over the population. Its a open question if this will ever fail though.
Just go look at a Ural vs Brent price differential chart and tell me that oil is fungible in this environment, it's obviously not, years and year of near parity and instantly it drops to -$35, stabilizing at around -$23 - this is because demand for Ural crude within the global oil market has dropped, it will start coming back as new supply chains open up new markets for the Russians.

Demand for oil in general has stayed the same, but demand for Ural crude has dropped and demand for non-Ural crude has increased, there's like 1 billion people now that are looking to stop using Russian O&G and those people will be looking elsewhere, whereas the countries turning to Russian O&G never had an issue with using it, the price just became more attractive. The only reason we can separate them into groups like this, with different impacts on their demand is because the supply chains are fucked up. If there were no supply chain issues and price differentials returned to normal, then I'd say it is fungible, but not right now.
end line will be that they will be always behind more secular/liberal countries,and other countries will probably exploit their idealogical obsessions for their benifit,like they have always done,look at middle east for example,hundreds of thousands people dead economies crashed, resources plundered,total destruction of cities cauz someone exploited those ideological holes.
A pogrom? Nah they were killing them all over. Burning them alive, there’s literally photos of It happening if you google search. Even the national all India radio was calling out anti Sikh slogans. Today they are still persecuted but you stay blind in your high mighty sand castle. India needs Sikh but want them as a bitch. It won’t happen.

bruh,literally 1000 girls per year(3 per day) from hindus,sikh,christian minorities are abducted,converted and married to a muslim guy, according to UN,and many of them minors,they have literally stopped posting data about their minorities,and best of all,judges do nothing even if you bought the case to court,it's nothing less than hell hole for minorities.

Yep. Only billionaires and hardcore racists would vote for this Republican Party if there wasn't the religious element. It would amount to 10% or less of the vote.

I lived through the 80s. It's so, so much better now. And the 80s were so much better than the 50s. Enormous amounts of progress have already been made. It wasn't that long ago that people were going to jail because of Satanic Panics or having their careers ruined for being gay.

Let's run through a not uncommon route. A GPS module is produced by a company, let's call it Spiteful Industry Inc. SII sells those GPS modules to drone repair shops across the country. Eventually newer better models from SII come out, so the drone repair shops wind up overstocking and auctioning off the old GPS modules since they are no longer a market standard. They auction them off to Sock Auction House. SAH holds sales of several large collections, including SII GPS modules. A company called Prison RR Inc purchases one of those collections for pennies on the dollar, and sells them off to Issued DM, a Nigerian company that resells American components across the African continent. IDM sells some of the components to TA Inc, a Dubai based company with branches in Egypt. TA Inc then resells the SII GPS units to Iran at a huge markup.
"Security" has outweighed "cohesion" and "stability". We have our evolved system of economics to thank; rampant without proper legislation or intelligible care. I think this is true for so many of our societies' ills.
I agree with you, mostly. They did set a bar for him that was both unreachable and in no way his own - and they have been trashing him for not even reaching for it.
Basically, Biden made a general stimulus proposal. Then Manchin made some general comments on the idea of a stimulus bill, including saying that he didn't want the sending out of stimulus checks to take precedence over getting vaccines out to the public, while also suggesting that maybe the checks were a bit too broadly targeted. A lot of folks in the media and liberal establishment started freaking out and interpreting it to mean Manchin was going to block the stimulus checks. But then the detailed proposals for stimulus are made, and the stimulus includes both the checks and spending to help get vaccines out, so Biden made Manchin's main worry irrelevant, by ensuring that the checks wouldn't be getting priority over vaccination. Also the income cutoffs for the full stimulus check were left unchanged compared to prior stimulus checks, but the Biden stimulus plan was tweaked to have a much faster "taper off", meaning that fewer people got the partial check.

So Biden didn't get Manchin to sign on to the stimulus by browbeating him, he got him to agree to it by changing the act in order to please Manchin (with the checks and also by lowering the $400 unemployment benefit boost to $300). Manchin wasn't the one who was pressured and changed his mind, he was the one who forced the bill to be changed, and ended up getting what he wanted.

Not only was Trump's entire campaign defined by Trump talking shit about his opponents (and really anyone who didn't support him) in terms you'd never expect a presidential candidate to stoop to, not only was his entire appeal that he was a crude asshole who said mean stuff...the rhetoric I heard from rank and file Republicans about people like me, people who share my beliefs, and politicians I vote for was just as bad as anything these agents said in their texts. Oh no, they said they could smell the Trump support in a Walmart? Boy do I have some memes about Obama to show you. They framed opposing Trump as a crisis moment? Hey, did you read that "flight 93 election" editorial where the author (an anonymous coward until later) explicitly compared his ideological opponents to terrorists who perpetrated the worst attack on our nation in modern history?
What a circus. Trump really knows how to get the courts involved in his games. This is why we need to get rid of him now! He's never been one for respecting the law or the people, and all this drama is proof enough.

There's also the danger of becoming the very thing you're trying to combat. If by trying to uphold and defend civil liberties for all, you slowly start eroding civil liberties for some, fascists will keep finding ways to circumvent such legalities. Sooner or later you'll have no choice but to keep implementing new "hatespeech" laws and thereby becoming an evermore authoritarian system not unlike fascism itself.
Some governments are even using retoric similar to yours and their censorship laws to combat legitimate political movements under the guise of fighting fascism. Look at how China brands the Hong Kong protestors as fascist. Or the way Putin justifies his invasion of Ukraine to "fight the facsists.".

No idea what this guy's deal actually is, like most people, I'm not very interested in listening to obvious nutjobs - but no matter how insane what he believes in or espouses is, I can not imagine a single situation where restricting someone's feedom of movement (across most of a continent, even) for 2 years because of anything they might think or say is reasonable.

Applied Behavioral Analysis/Therapy is torture. Really, at the hart of any behavioral psychology is a philosophy of deprivation, negative reinforcement and the least effective positive reinforcement. Deprivation and negative reinforcement seem like the partners here, and they are at first, the real shit begins when you start rewarding your subject/patient. There in lies the rub. An ethical behavioral approach begins with earning trust and unconditional positive reinforcement. Deprivation is always a natural consequence: you throw your plate on the floor, your dinner is ruined. Negative reinforcement always takes the path of "Your threw the plate of dinner on the floor and now you have to eat a sandwich instead.".

But what I have observed repeatedly is conservative people fucking up their own lives and ruining family relationships due to failing to accept another's sexuality. I've seen that plenty of times. I've heard about this from just about every LGTBQ+ person I've known.

Imagine that. They knew they hadn't won but continued to lie to the MAGADittoheads in the Republican Party and got their useful idiot True Believers arrested for trying to foment a violent coup, but they still cling to their abusers and try to argue that they are not just a bunch of fucking fascists.

By not releasing the study? probably none. It could be used as evidence that collecting donations to help find proof of the supposed election fraud after this study was done was fraudulent.

The fact that it is not obvious, is kind of sad. Too many seemingly normal people have revealed themselves to be as hateful, unbalanced, irrational bigots as Trump.

Yup. If they aren’t going to prison, they need to actually pay. Buy all the houses in the city that are now uninhabitable. Relocate the citizens if needed. COMPENSATE THE CITIZENS EACH AT LEAST $10-50K. Then pay shitloads of fines. At least $100 million.

In the US, the Proud Boys would be way more terrifying if they all lived within a 5 hour drive from another, rather than nearly 50. And also pointing out that If the Germany had same proportion of fascists as the US does it would be a very scary situation due to vicinity.
I was mostly trying to convey that most would think Germany would be one of the last places for far right ideologies to begin to thrive again during this fascist wave. I never said The US didn’t have fascists, we’ve arguably got more than any other country proportionally - i was simply stating the fact that physically smaller, mostly landlocked countries are easier for extremist groups to organize quickly, which makes them scarier.

Actually the perfect comparison. The US have a death sentence for murder yet müder rates are extremely high. It simply doesn’t work this way. If someone wants to kill someone he’ll do it either way and if someone wants to get a gun he’ll try to get it either way too.

Exactly. So many people are caught up with Sony fighting this and Microsoft promising to keep Call of Duty on Playstation but they are completely ignoring that the big publishers are gobbling up the smaller ones like crazy. It's starting to leave the future landscape of AAA gaming looking pretty bland. Look at EA. Everyone loves to shit on them for buying up studios, interfering in any major IP, milking the IP dry, and then the second they make a rushed game that didn't preform to their standards shut the studio down. That's a future I'm afraid of seeing out of all these acquisitions by the big studios. I love Playstation's first party games but they are starting to feel kinda similar to everything else they put out. It's (mostly) all single player, 3rd person, action/adventure games (please bring back Killzone or Resistance). I love that Xbox has Gamepass but they can't put out a high quality exclusive to save their life (looking at you to prove me wrong Bethesda). I miss when these studios could afford to take chances and make a weird game or one that goes against what they normally make but now it's all about pleasing Business Daddy by making the next blockbuster franchise or the next sequel or be shut down. I know indies are there and that's where a lot of the variety comes from now but I'm talking specifically AAA games here.

Ukrainians are in absolute apperication of what America has given Ukraine. My cousin fought in Ukraine and on his last evening in Ukraine he had a meal with his commander and a few fellow soldiers and he was told he was now American/Ukrainian and he countered "but I don't even speak Ukrainian" and they laughed and said "most Ukrainians don't speak Ukrainian when they become Ukrainian" he looked confused and said "Babies, babies don't speak when they are born, but they learn".
100%! I travelled there in 2018 with a bunch of Kiwi guys from London and for the most part they were just stand up people. I've also been to Russia around the same time, and not so much for then.

The American public in general will likely see a net positive effect, since ramping up production of military equipment means more jobs, and most defense companies pay well and are rated as some of the best places to work, and many are unionized.

If they weren't to extend the retirement age, an elderly person will find themselves in one of two scenarios imo : 1) SS payments are too small to live off of, so the person rejoins the rat race at 77 2) the SS payment run out at a certain age like say 85 and then you're fucked becuase you're too old to get back in the workplace and now you're just a burden on your younger family members.

A utopia by my standards. Meanwhile, in the good ole USA, I'm chastised for not picking up the phone or answering emails over the weekend in a timely manner (not just answer, but answer them now), that I'm just not "putting in my all" or "caring about the company" or some baloney. It is so dumb.

The high income/corporate/other taxes is actually a major issue in france imo because companies looking to expand into europe simply don't consider France (generally speaking) due to the myriad of taxes that they would have to pay to for example hire an employee.

I've heard that line for decades. Literal decades. SS is fine and very much solvent if Congress stopped treating it like a slush fund they dip in to whenever they need some cash.
Here's a very simplified example. A household earning $500k in a year is considered to be a 1% earner. They would currently pay about $150k or so in federal taxes. That's approximately the same amount they'd pay under this proposed tax plan if they spent 100% of what they earned in the year. Realistically, earners at that level could spend 20% or less of their income under this proposal and still live very comfortably. That amounts to an effective tax rate of 6% ($500k x 20% x 30% / $500k). Any money not spent increases their wealth directly at the expense of middle class taxpayers, since the middle class will spend a larger proportion of their total income to survive. For example, a middle class household earning $100k would either have to spend 100% of their income to match the 1% example at 20%, for an effective tax rate of 30%, or to match the same effective tax rate of 6%, they could only spend $20k in the year.
No, no. The last two decades was let the rich pay less so you could earn more via trickle down (even though salary is a business expense). Now its just let the rich pay less.
Let us not forget that these are the same people supporting the destruction of public schools through school vouchers and pushing private school educations. This asshole is quite literally admitting to one of the major issues that critics of the program have. That private schools can be exclusive of minorities. Typically the GOP line has been to play this off and just claim that schools will have independent admission standards. Yet, here we see the truth. That they would most certainly try to influence those admission standards, and that exclusion is the point. Fuck them.

Christian nationalists are nothing but completely bent motherfuckers. If this is what religion can twist some people, I'd rather live in a world without any religion.

Exactly. They think it's some bizarre contagion. I can't imagine how backwards their thinking is, and what they tell their kids daily.

Low unemployment increases wages. Increased wages increases cost of goods and services. It is basic economics and is not that complicated. No tinfoil hat needed.

Now these companies are trying to fill their positions and it's creating a vacuum where a lot of people with college degrees who have been working service industry before can now find corporate jobs and it's tightening the service industry and manual labor job market to a breaking point.

SAME! Left a job where I was super underpaid, super overworked, for a fully remote job that pays double my old salary, tons of appreciation from my team and leadership, and the workload feels like a cakewalk. I’ve been at the new place for a year now, but keep thinking “Is this what a job is actually supposed to be like??”.

And no, Germany does not backtrack on defense spending. The money is there, but planning is not ready for instant spending. And guess who has been responsible for military planning over the past 16 years? Yes, Springer's favorite german conservatives. Pot, kettle.
Also (if it works the same in Germany as here in Sweden) the Regering/Bundesreigerung/Ruling Party can't really decide anything, they are the executive power, it's the Riksdag/Bundestag/parliament that decides and tasks the Regering/Bundesreigerung with executing said decisions.

Who is Springer? Did not catch their name in the article, nor as writers of the article. It is a noticeable difference in stance from the Zeitenwende speech shortly after the invasion of Ukraine in February, no? Is there really good reason for why they're not planning/attempting to match the 2% NATO commitment on national defense spending before 2025 now? Especially during a time of tense conflict on the borders of NATO that have transformed the post-Soviet terms in Europe.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
What? Fetterman literally made a name for himself as a mayor who worked to revitalize a former steel mill town, and then made restoring American manufacturing jobs a central plank of his Senate campaign. You mentioned Bethlehem specifically, so is a video of Fetterman holding a rally there, where his campaign spoke specifically about plant closures and job loss.

However, we need education and industrial policy in this country that provides opportunity for non-intellectuals. We need more apprenticeship opportunities and publicity for options already available. We need more community college programs and companies that train workers rather than poach them from less successful economies where government invests in training. I have read that there are serious shortages in skilled blue collar opportunities in all fields as boomers retire. We need to build better pipelines to work.

Outsourcing completely obliterated the heartland. It's true that a lot of that happened decades ago, but it's not like anyone ever solved the problem. People still need good-paying jobs.
You spend your entire life sheltered and hidden away, your family life has got to be absolutely fucked, and then one day you inherit leadership of the most fucked up country on the planet. What are you supposed to do? Enacting any sort of change might get you assassinated by your generals/ family/ elite class. You can’t just leave, again you’d probably be assassinated and you also don’t have any wealth beyond the country. Diplomatically who do you reach out to? Your country has spent the last half century being the boogeyman & laughing stock of the world and your options for world super powers & regional powers are Russia and China 2 shitty authoritarian governments, America who you have legitimate historical beef with for flattening every building in your country back in the 50s, Japan who has never admitted fault for WW2, and South Korea which really does not want to deal with your shit. Even if you could throw up your hands and say fuck it and hand the country over to South Korea they probably wouldn’t take it, and/or it would star a war with China.
Outstanding. A narcissistic alcoholic dictator with unfettered access to nuclear weapons is undergoing a midlife crisis. That couldn’t possibly end badly….
