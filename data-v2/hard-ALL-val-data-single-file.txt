At least when you smear one second, you remain within the +/- 0.9 seconds tolerance of a well designed system. But +/- 1 minute in navigation error is over 16 miles. And, it would break some big money transfer security systems.
That's another way of saying that we all better hide for those two minutes. Banking, credit transactions, stock market, computer file transfers, air flights, even a lot of ship traffic in ports, .... they're all going to be really messed up for two minutes. People in cars using their GPS will miss their turns.

We already have very good synchronizing of clocks, that's not the problem. The problem is the damn Earth! It doesn't rotate once every exactly 24 hours (relative to the sun), and yet a lot of applications depend on 24 hours. Such as silly humans, who don't want sunrise being labeled as "2:00 AM". A lot of computerized stuff needs Earth rotation time = UTC time +/- 0.9 seconds (astronomers, and satellites).

I think the earth's rotation and the year are probably the two things that matter most as far as measuring time is concerned.

I would suggest that we replace months with deciyears (36 days per deciyear), and replace hours, minutes and seconds with millidays and microdays.
I think you mean "euphemisms" - when you basically substitute an expression with another that is relatively similar in meaning, but has a much softer or more positive connotation. e.g.: "This isn't a war, it's just a special military operation!".
The whole "false dichotomy" things makes no sense in the context of your post. Are you mad someone is boiling a complex issue into a simple binary option (a.k.a. a false dichotomy) or that you think the word "support" is far too kind and harmless to describe what the russians did (euphemism)?

Seems like it, and yet it would have been so much more concise to write '_Russians killed one protest leader abroad/in Germany_'.

Maybe she was murdered by Putin's people, maybe Putin's opponents are killing Putin's people. Wouldn't be surprised if Putin's gone by the end of the year.

By the time this is over, he might be. Recently one of Putin's close allies was murdered accidentally fell from a window on accident.

I suspect most know deep down that it's a lie, but they want to believe it, because they'd rather not admit they were wrong or that they're supporting bad people.
The first one literally had an abbreviation of "Communist Party of China" written on it in Chinese. I mean, yeah, anyone could technically stick that on a balloon, but who would?
True, China publicly claimed that one. Could be Russia or someone realized "wait, they let balloons through their airspace?" and jumped on it. You never know.

but I agree with what you're saying. if they were shooting military planes out of they sky you'd think they'd be grounding civilian aircraft. Unless of course they're trying to somehow keep this quiet. I'm sure grounding flights would be the last thing they want to do and would be absolutely devasting to the economy and would cause pandemonium. Perhaps they've known about ufos all along and have been trying to keep it quiet bc just that. idk.

I'm not saying it's not. how the fk would I know. I popped up on my news feed and it's on Twitter.. I'm just saying I that I just read an article about it and thats what some people are saying.

There is a law preventing this because that idea is silly. PLACA shields these manufacturers because they are not responsible for anything that happens with that product after purchase, the same as every car manufacturer is not responsible for someone buying a vehicle and plowing through a crowd. Knife manufacturers aren’t responsible if you hurt yourself with a knife or someone else either.
I agree with you something meaningful should be done but I cannot think of an effective solution because clearly Californias hundreds of gun laws only hinder law abiding gun owners and do little to nothing against criminal use of a firearm.

Well it's not legal to leave California and go into other states to buy guns that aren't legal in California, so if you aren't going to obey that law then you might as well stay in California and not obey the law.

They have been out of power in California for a long time, the Dems in CA don't need anything from the Republicans when they can just hammer through any legislation they want. Pretty incredible to blame the other side when you have a supermajority that can't be resisted.
Two Jewish guys from Odesa meet up. One asks the other: ‘So what’s the situation? What are people saying?'”.
Yep. Plus they repeated their own propaganda about Ukrainians so much that they started to believe in their superiority and underestimate Ukrainians. If someone is capable to stop Russian soldier than it can't be Ukrainian...

But all in all, russians are fighting the tenacity of Ukranian people, who're super inclined to defend their freedom to death, their own or their enemy's.

They believe that civilians of Ukraine are just Russians that are waiting for liberation and everyone that fighting them are brainwashed Russians that became nazis and NATO soldiers.

They keep saying they're fighting NATO in Ukraine because that's the only way they can excuse the amount of failure they've had. Russians would not be happy if they realized they entered a 1-year long meat grinder in exchange for barely holding the frontline in Eastern Ukraine.

Russia always lived off the "Don't wake the sleeping bear" propaganda of their army being hyper-macho commandos with giga-hypersonic missiles.
Interesting stat is that the number of kids married couples have is actually pretty stable. The number that keeps going down and down is the marriage rate, and it’s not just in Japan. You have as the biggest impact the positive development associated with the rapid rise in social status and freedom for women, where as previously they were married off as soon as they graduate mandatory education, versus now where the majority pursue higher education or employment. The second biggest impact is that we also have far more entertainment options for single people. No one is spending their saturdays going out to bars to meet single people and have sex when they can curl up indoors and watch a good tv show or movie from their laptop. They can even get sexual gratification from just a single push of the button.
It’s a global issue and the only solution in a capitalist system is to make no changes and be satisfied with becoming a poorer country in the long run, or basically import enough people from around the world to remake your demographic makeup. There are no 3rd options. Robots and automation isn’t going to do fuck all but make like 2 guys in the entire country rich while the rest become service gig slaves.

For me the solution is simple, either robotics will help the shrinking labor force or they are destined to get a piece of karma back. Not working on culture reforms to accept other races sucks when you need people to work in your country.

Japan is one of the most racists countries for immigrants. Immigration will not work. Their economy has been in limbo for decades now after the 1990’s. They import most of their raw materials.
Because they could just leave it alone and focus on real issues. Also, how about just letting go of the idea that “business attire” somehow means a suit and tie.
Men have to wear a suit and tie, always have. Slacks, dress shoes, that sort. If you're not in that attire the supreme court, regular court, state courts, etc would have you removed.

You actually can. Have you ever shopped cheap? Just curious. Just go to any second hand clothing store for most of it, pick up a 40 dollar jacket off some discount rack. Done.

A Missouri representative makes more than an average Missourian does. You can go and get slacks, a shirt, shoes and a jacket for under 100 dollars assuming you buy cheap and actively try to save money. Most employers require more than that for employees. If we're going to cry about price, then remove the damn steel toed requirement for most manufacturing jobs because my boots cost more than a cheap suit does.

Where the f- do you work that your employer isn't offering at least a partial price match for your boots? Have you ever looked through their handbook?
If poor people had access to lawyers like rich people, we’d need 30,000 Supreme Court Justices and a proportional number of lower court judges just to avoid the most simple of traffic fine from taking longer than the heat death of the universe to arrive.
Oh wait… we have an executive branch pushing the idea that a President may not be indicted. The Legislation passed laws to prevent insider trading and are doing everything they can to ensure they can keep that up as long as possible… SCOTUS members aren’t subject to their own ethics rules they set for Justices….

So why don't they just call this out with their lawyers why does it take forever to sort this crap out? Aren't some things in law fairly binary? There are clear rules right? Can't they just be like "Nope. show up on Tuesday cheese dick.".

Thirdly; this entire idea was created from taking a quote from a Virginia governor candidate wildly out of context.
What he actually said was "If a child is born with a terminal and incurable illness, and it will quickly die, then the doctor should respect the parents' wishes about whether or not to put the kid through life-saving procedures which cannot save its life and will only prolong its suffering. The government shouldn't force itself into that terrible situation.".

They characterized it as "he said that kids that survive an abortion should be thrown in the trash.".

Yep. This was also a ballot proposal in Montana that failed back in November. It basically says that if a baby survives an abortion procedure, then the doctors will be forced to deliver it and treat it like any other case of premature birth, or else they will be jailed for five years.

More importantly, what kind of precedent does it set when you allow the murder of a child who is now outside the mother’s body and is capable of surviving on its own and can lead a healthy life but it needs immediate medical attention for it to survive? Do we just let a guy having a heart attack die because no one wants him to be alive? After all, no one wants him and he can no longer “live on his own.” He’ll die without treatment but he could live and continue to live for a time afterwards if he receives proper medical treatment.

I mean, a quick google search can tell you while extremely rare, it is possible for a baby to survive an abortion. It is far easier to destroy than it is to create.
Then by 80s suddenly there was a real panic of American being taken over by Japan economically. That is why media from the 80s (Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, Karate movies, sci-fi novels) all have significant Japanese supremacy etc.
I think the point is what we think of Japan is what we think of China now. Japan used to sell walmart quality crap, now high tech products. The same thing can also (and already partially) happen for China.

China's growth period has past. Population is falling and will halve by 2050. Seriously, half! A crash like that has no equal in history, we don't even have a model for what that does to an economy.

I guess Russia's plan of "we will just buy everything from China and India now" is failing. Especially since China also creates large problems for russian ship cargo certification, since they refuse to accreditate russian cargo and lowered the import of cars and electronics into Russia.

In the recent past, Russia has also restricted the export of some of their most advanced military technology to China, who has otherwise been their largest importer of military equipment.
I often wonder if there will ever be a geopolitical event that India won't in some way blame on the US or UK. I fully expect that in a few years India will claim that the west pressured them to support Russia during its invasion of Ukraine.
The 3 million number was reported by USSR/Pravda in support of India's involvement in the Pakistani civil war (which would have the effect of reducing western influence in the region and advancing the USSR in the cold war).

Bruh. That number is just blatantly false. The H1B program as a whole only has 65k seats/positions available, with an additional 20k for applicants who have completed a degree in the US.
And at uni levels, really all levels, but uni especially, the goal of reading isn’t to agree with what is written, to conform to what it says. You don’t read Frankenstein to agree to reanimate corpses. Rather, to analyze and discuss who wrote it, why it was written, when and where it was written, what else was being written at the time, an analysis of the analogies, the social commentary (without expressly agreeing), etc. Hell, a well-stated critique on clearly defined grounds would likely be lauded.
Students can either select a different elective if a class syllabus has a book they don’t want to read or a topic they abhor, or… nothing requires them to major in a topic they don’t agree with.

I assume (pre uni level) that if a particular parent didn’t want their child to read a given book, almost all schools would find an alternative book for that lesson, or would accommodate in some way.

It’s because parents that are against banning books are working at their jobs, taking care of their children and generally being responsible. The only way we fight this is figuring out how to make it so that people can be responsible AND as loud as republican complainers.

With the Republican party, he has other people doing most of the ground work, but them he puts his name on it.
Honestly I think that’s entirely how the founders intended it. And I know it’s so outdated and they couldn’t anticipate where people would migrate too in terms of population centers like the big cities. They simply didn’t exist back then in the way they do now. That is why I will defend the senate in that regard. I don’t know I’m trying to see things from all sides, at least in the future in this country.
If the gop disappeared tomorrow it would only take about a year to have the division be between central democrats and progressives. That’s my opinion on it.

No chance in hell that will happen, we could increase the house to around 2000 representatives... technically it would only take a federal law to do that, and it would wipe out the small state advantage and be good for politics in general...

If they had wanted this lopsided they would have made it this lopsided, they chose to give small states an advantage, and they would still retain power in the Senate that would balance out the larger states.

As it stands folks in smaller states have way more say in presidential elections than the founders intended. It would just be ensuring equal representation in the house, the Senate would still be tilted toward small states, and small states would still retain more political power per person through the electoral college, even if that edge is lessened.

I agree the Senate is important in balancing large vs small, but that's exactly why the house should function as designed, and provide equal representation Per Capita.
Graduate students aren't herded into a room and basically lied to that their degrees will make paying back loans simple, the way freshmen are (with little to no explanation of the impact of compounding interest), so it's understandable and I hope it works out.
10% is the current level for IBR. What will make a difference for graduate students is the planned increase the threshold of what counts as discretionary income. If that works out, it will lower graduate payments simply because the 10% threshold will be based on a smaller amount of their income.

If all you can afford to pay on your loan is $0 a month, maybe you should have considered a different career track or whether you should have the school you did in the first place.

Endowments aren't built from tuition rates or collected from students; they're funded by donors. But schools should be tapping into them more to help address the rising costs of education.

It did, but the implementation is hung up in court. So it looks like the admin is trying to split the program and implement the IBRP changes separately.
Yes, please! The 50 plus years of embargo has accomplished nothing. The Cuban leadership still kowtows to the Russian and Chinese governments. Perhaps a change in US policy will improve the relations between Cuba and the US and make Cuba more amenable to a democratic government.
Yeah, I cannot figure out if the anti-Castro Cubans in Miami are just dumb as a brick or have succumbed to the Russian propaganda which probably advocates status quo. Cuba is certainly not more democratic as a result of the embargo. The anti-Castro Cubans will have a better chance of making Cuba a democratic state by lifting the embargo.

If the anti-Castro Cubans hate equal opportunity, they can still vote for the GOP and also favor lifting the embargo. Their continued support for the embargo, which hurts their Cuban families back home, is a mystery to me.

The embargo is stupid, but Cuba would still have an awful government and economy without it. The embargo is not what holds Cuba back, not by a long shot.

Cuba's problem is not the embargo. They get everything they need from Mexico and China. Their problem is not to have any money to buy things.
Blatter wasn't in favour of Qatar as a host (he is still corrupt due to other issues) but Platini, president of UEFA was in favour of QATAR. He initially wanted to vote for the US but changed his mind after a dinner with Sarkozy and Al Thani. Just a coincidence of course, like Platini's son getting a well-paid consultant role at Qatar Sport Invest afterwards.
Some Superclubs wanted to make their own Champions League and wanted "to leave" UEFA. Long messy story short: Paris, of course, wasn't interested in joining the Super League and UEFA rewarded Paris owner, Al-Khelaifi, by making him the Chairman of the ECA.

European clubs weren't happy with the Winter WC because it is interfering with their European season. The ECA was flown to Qatar and after returning most clubs stopped their resistance for a winter world cup. Just a coincidence, like Rummenigge, head of the ECA during that time, getting caught with 2 Rolex at customs from returning to Munich from Qatar.

It's even further dispicable that they're threatening to do this because if they don't then them doing it hurts FIFA's relations with Qatar, which in turn hurts FIFA's bottom dollar and we all know FIFA can't let that happen.

It has always been a joke and FIFA has been riddled with corruption but only people are realising it now since it is being held in a middle eastern country.

The plurality of the blame for corruption in FIFA falls on officials who were originally from Europe and/or associated with UEFA. I do think UEFA is the only federation that has enough power for this to maybe work on its own, but Europe has been allowing this version of FIFA to exist since the 70s and its not like there weren't tons of previous corrupt acts. FIFA officials don't even care if you get publicly caught doing corrupt things, as long as you pay them they will continue to re-elect you. In most organizations if you get publicly outed then your done.
States with stricter gun regulation see lower gun crime. Waiting periods for instance are shown to dramatically decrease gun violence.
“Mental health” is the tiredest most hollow refrain from the pro-gun lobby (whose goal is to sell as many guns and gun accessories as possible all the time).

the vast majority of mass shooters are not experiencing a mental health crisis, this is a red herring used by the right to dismiss gun violence. just like they dismiss the suicides by gun as well. since you can't compel someone to seek treatment perhaps making it way harder to get firearms would be helpful. all i know is i have a right not to be murdered while going to the store and that should outweigh someones right to carry a firearm in public.

i live in a place where i have more places to buy guns near my house that i have to buy food. guns are insanely easy to get and that's exactly the problem. the rate of gun violence in this country mostly tracks the increased numbers of guns in US households.
How is she a spoiler for D's? The only group where she has favorable numbers is with R's and they won't won't vote for her en masse over a moderate R candidate. Same with a D candidate who will have Kelly, Hobbs, Fontes, etc. stumping for them. In a three way race she siphons more votes from R's than D's.
To run as an indy she'll need 3% of total registered voters who are not members of a ballot-qualified political party (per ballotpedia and AZleg.gov), that's about 42k+. Obviously, her team feels that's attainable, but where... Also, I can see both parties challenging the signatures to keep her off the ballot.

It seems more like she's banking on the D's not fielding a candidate and letting her run, should she choose. That's the only thing that makes sense to me at the moment. It doesn't make sense for the local or national party to be OK with that as Kelly has won twice, Hobbs has won, Fontes has won, and there are attractive/qualified candidates who could run (Gallego, heck even Hobbs) and her "stance" isn't inline with the electorate anymore.

Perhaps. I don't see it, she's very unpopular with everyone and a Murkowski-esque effort isn't that feasible for her.

If she’s the only candidate I still wouldn’t vote for her. She betrayed us in so many ways after we elected her in good faith. She might as well have an R next to her name.
Actually resolution was accepted with amendment L.52 which inserts a new operative paragraph, reading: “Notes with alarm that the Russian Federation has sought to justify its territorial aggression against Ukraine on the purported basis of eliminating neo-Nazism, and underlines that the pretextual use of neo-Nazism to justify territorial aggression seriously undermines genuine attempts to combat neo-Nazism”.
“Moscow's attempt to exploit the pretext of combating neo-Nazism to justify its brutal war against Ukraine, with Ukraine's delegate asserting that the draft has nothing in common with the genuine fight against Nazism and neo-Nazism.”.

The problem for Ukraine is that the one of their national heroes worked with the nazis and did some nasty stuff, which is exactly why russia has been pushing this motion.

Of course we all know how the equivalent of useful idiots and tankies supported the Nazis, others then supported the USSR , and now apparently they spread Russian propaganda for them.

The Azov group were being retrained and had been out under national command - ironically the Russian invasion and their defence of Mariupol will have actually realised their prestige.

I’m fact the usual suspects are the Azov battalion who were at most 6,000 strong in a total military force of something like 200,000 regulars and the same again national guard? Funnily enough the quest-fascist mercenary Wagner group is actually larger.

Far right Nationalists won a fraction and indeed a falling fraction of the vote in the last Ukraine elections. Far , far less than can be said won in Russian elections!
If they ban social media the kids won't get pregnant anymore. Since social media is how the libs groom girls into seducing their church leadership. /s.
Hm. Well, your first paragraph is the only one that infers the contents of the First Amendment. On it, I'd say yes and no. Thinking about it, I'd imagine the ulterior motive is to prevent teens from accessing liberal viewpoints or safe spaces, but I do feel like there's some implication towards the toxicity social media brings to social status and body issues, with the repeated citation of rising mental health problems in minors.

And yes, they would definitely argue that vpns are bad because it gives kids access to social media, while also saying that vpns are bad because they are suppressing conservative opinions by blocking social media sites without the first hint of awareness of how stupid that sounds.

No they would find out that corporate vpns block things like YouTube, and then all of a sudden it would be a war on vpns.

Do they think that everyone under 18 is just completely oblivious to VPNs? So would id verification have to be for everyone, even outside the state or even outside the US? It seems like it may also end up steering teenagers to deeper more obscure and uncontrolled sections of the web.

Also isnt social media quite literally designed to be addictive, the damage is already done mentally to lots of teens who i doubt would just give up their access without trying things like a VPN. I agree with the idea i guess, but it seems like its about 10-15 years too late, as well as hard to implement affectively.
Filed in federal court on the eve of Election Day, the lawsuit argues that a Pennsylvania state law requiring voters to date the outer envelopes of absentee ballots "has no relevance to determining whether an individual is qualified to vote, in violation of the Civil Rights Act, and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right.".
I take this as they just want to make sure as many votes are counted, because that’s how elections are supposed to work. Throwing ballots out due to a missing date, even though they have been postmarked, shouldn’t affect the validity of the ballot.

So yeah... if you don't think about it sure that totally makes sense to invalidate votes based on a date that's not necessary as they have already been provided before the date.

Yeah dates that are trying to be used to disqualify under the requirement they be received before end of election day. If they are already turned in, obviously they arrived before election day.

I don't think democrats think these are all Fetterman votes, but legitimate votes should be counted either way. I do think Republicans consider these votes to not be in their favor, this being one of many cases they are trying to prevent legitimate votes from being counted in order to try to win in various districts/states.

Not sure the argument is more under the assumption that it will benefit democrats, than it is more the belief that in a functional democracy all votes should be counted, no matter who they are cast for. I agree the right has decided it will benefit them NOT to count those due to the history of the left voting early and absentee. I am a far leftist and believe all votes should be counted even if it will not benefit my side.
Democrats are famously addicted to failure. They’ve shaken it a little recently, but I’d be shocked if they have the ability to be strategic, and I say that as someone who supports democrats.
I know, I’m sorry I was being sarcastic, I’m just frustrated because sometimes it feels like democrats are putting their efforts into mundane elections where they have very little base. In missouri our two largest cities are blue and the democrats barely know what they’re doing here, my city isn’t the largest in missouri and it’s absolutely pitiful. I was just feeling bitter and pessimistic.

So you know the history of slavery in Africa? How so called slaves had rights. And their children weren't born slaves. That most of al slaves were captives of war. That most western/subsara african economies did not necessitate slavery as most were communal socieoeconomical. And that when Africas tried to cease slave trade with Europeans once learning the conditions of chatell slavery they would be either forced into slavery themselves killed or forced to continue to capture?
I already told you my opinion on Slavery, all I am saying is that in this day and age we were taught more of the Europeans doing slavery than what other countries were doing that took part or contributed to this awefull practice.

Well I can be pretty certain that every country in the world (yes even Africa) used or is using slavary at some point even to boost their economy or production.

I dont think that this "but Africa and Arabs learned their lessons and are finally turning against Europe" is as sunny and bright as you portay it. Untill this very day their are still slaves in those same countries, hell they even appear in China and India.

The only thing that changed is the way we see slavary, and also the work they are doing. After that its all the same, no bright future, no leaning, no free time, bad health conditions, difficulty to set them free.
vietnam has CENTURIES of interactions with China, went through many phases, but each time China tried to funny, they have been resolutely repelled.
While about a thousand years ago China did directly rule parts of Northern Vietnam as part of their control over this region, they eventually learned that direct control wasn't the best way to go about 'pacifying' the region. Over time, the tusi system was adopted instead. Under this system, certain tribes and 'tribal nobles' could hold certain aristocratic titles to their local regions and receive the backing of the Chinese state to maintain control. This was very attractive to many local tribal leaders, as they could use Chinese armies to crush their local rivals. While they would nominally have to be a part of China as a whole, they possessed an enormous amount of autonomy and could inherit their titles, something which didn't exist in China proper (officials might hold the same titles their parents held, but there was no guaranteed inheritance). Additionally, Chinese influence in this region was so weak that many tusi chieftains would often swear allegiance to multiple states at once, leading to border conflicts between other powers.

The region of Southern China/Northern India/large parts of northern Southeast Asia, technically known as the Southeast Asian Massif but famously named Zomia by Willem Van Schendel and James C. Scott, is considered one of the least governable regions on Earth. Mountainous terrain combined with a tropical/subtropical climate and high incidence of diseases such as malaria made it very difficult for states of any kind to effectively rule this region. For most of modern history, the Massif was dominated by a coterie of very ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of people, who often lived in smaller tribes and communities. Because of how hard this area was to govern, many bandits and rebels in China (and other states) would flee to this region and use it as a staging ground to either launch a war or simply raid nearby settlements. As such, many Chinese Empires saw controlling this region as vital to their own internal stability. Additionally, this region also had a large number of copper and salt mines, both very lucrative resources in Chinese Imperial history (copper was used as the most common form of currency, and salt was a vital resource in the preservation of meats).

Historically Chinese empires viewed their frontiers as areas of vital national importance. Many dynasties had been toppled or weakened by invasions/conflicts with 'barbarians' on their Western, Southern, and Northern borders. The Southern border, where Vietnam is, had been particularly difficult to rule due to the complicated geography of the region.

The point of all this is that China's historic meddling and expansion in the region wasn't as simple as merely trying to "invade and take Vietnam" for nationalist purposes, something which did happen but was eventually abandoned as a long-term project. It had more to do with the region being a source of both instability for all states bordering it and vital resources.
I understand the circus part of her quote but even though McCarthy is from Bakersfield he’s delivering little to no bread to the common man.
Exactly. McCarthy and Company just proposed a flat 30% sales tax and rescinding income taxes for the rich and corporations. They aren’t handing out bread to placate the masses, they want to make it cost 30% more.

Yeah, McCarthy won 2/3 of the 1/3 of folks that bothered to vote in a district that wouldn’t be red if California hadn’t unilaterally disarmed from political gerrymandering.

One of McCarthy's problems (of which there are several ...) is that while there are about 20 members of his conference from the "nut wing" of the GOP, there are plenty more "moderates" than that (plus some not-so-moderate ones that actually interpreted the 2022 mid-term elections properly, and understand that the voters are sick of the hyper-partisanship that the GOP engages in).

If the Democrats thought McCarthy could be a decent Speaker, they would have negotiated with him (and he with them) rather than forcing him to give a ton of concessions to the most MAGA wing of the Republican party to get the position.

They could, but McCarthy is also from the wing-nut side of the Republican caucus, so unless he suddenly decided to become a moderate, the best outcome is his speakership fails quickly, and some moderate Republicans work with the Democrats to put one of the moderate Republicans in the Speaker position, and then work together on whatever their bipartisan coalition can actually agree on.
The new thing is that they are no longer capable of being in it for themselves, either. They are simply unable to wield power because their internal factions are at each other’s throats.
The Republicans are unable to Govern for a myriad of reasons. The fact that they are debating who should be speaker rather that receiving a dictate from on high and marching in lockstep is not one of them.

If they can’t get together over the Speakership, the next two years will just be a non-stop cat fight over everything and the Democrats will just recruit some of the smarter Republicans to get things done. Because there won’t be a Republican Party coherent enough to be worth belonging to.

Which is not at all something I’d agree with, fwiw, as I linked there’s good reason to think wages go up as a result of immigration, but you can pick your poison I suppose.
I have very good news, which is that immigrants don’t drive down wages for native workers, and probably increase wages for natives. Check out comment I made to another reply. It addresses housing too, which is a separate issue.

Of course not, but immigration has enough benefits for everyone involved to make it worthwhile to ensure you’re building enough housing, which again, you have to do anyway.

2-If we don't have enough housing but we keep increasing the number of people in need of it, there can only be one inevitable result. That's just common sense. And look! That's exactly what happened and now we're all grabbing our ankles while the BoC tries to address a separate but related issue.
Actually in the mid 1980s rents went down after controls were out in place and home ownership was actually affordable.

Here's the thing. Nobody wanted him for the 2016 campaign, either. He got the nomination because, while the majority did not want him, they couldn't decide on who else they wanted. There were something like 9 candidates at the start. 75% of them didn't want Trump, but they split that 75% between the other 8 candidates and Trump kept "winning" because 25% would beat the 10% everyone else was getting because the votes were split between so many people.

Same thing can happen in the next election. That 25% of MAGA die-hards will stick with him and unless everyone else can pick a candidate very early on, he'll keep winning primaries. And the one thing Republicans do well is fall into line when someone looks like they are going to be the pick. Most of those "never Trump" people right now will vote for him if he looks like he's going to be the nominee because all they care about is that the candidate has an "R" next to his name at the end of the day.
Well the US army is under 500k whereas the Russian army on one of their borders has just under 1M men. Their army is currently larger than the US army by quite a bit. Does the US have equipment and manpower to (if this article is accurate) triple the size of their army in less than a year? Probably... Lol... It is however a massive undertaking.
I agree, however Ukraine will run out of manpower long before Russia will... Even trading 20:1... So economic crash is best hope to emd the war.

So instead of fighting the war NATO hopes their economy will collapse or infighting will take them down. Ukraine however cannot replace every combat age man (approx 60k training in Europe amd the US). Ukraine is hoping 60k conscripts will counter the 100k man advantage Russia curfently has/had. (Approx 1M russians to 800k Ukranians). ukraine can maybe squeeze out 1M but Russia will conscript up to 1.5M... Its not an escalation Ukraine can win.

What I want more than anything is for the west to supply Ukraine so it can defeat russia on its own. Ukrainians know what they need to achieve victory, and so far they’re not really getting it.

A 'quick' Ukrainian victory would require direct intervention by Nato. At the start of the invasion, that would have probably meant escalation into a world war, which as it turns out, Russia would have lost (but no one really knew that for sure), assuming China didn't get involved, because a European ground war would be a perfect moment for China to seize Taiwan. Who do you want to feed to the wolves?

It's dangerous to make predictions about China's future. The Party could always be dislodged by some unforeseen, cataclysmic event. But short of that, the surveillance system gives it an extremely powerful tool for maintaining control.

And most of their General KMTs general did not follow orders. -Japan war. I highly doubt China can defend Shanghai and Nanjing. Their troop lack training, equipment, and supply. Some of their troops only carry swords. Western countries refuse to train and equipped the KMT army.
Not even the KMT wants to join the PRC. 80-85% just want things to stay the way they are - unlike the DPP and their Western infiltrators and puppet masters who will do anything in their power to provoke the PRC.

So only half the population supported independence during Nancy Pelosi fiasco on a poll from an incredibly biased source (Taiwan Foundation for Democracy). My guess is in an actual vote they would lose. PRC is Taiwan's largest trading partner (about 40-50%), they are hyper aware of this fact.
the gap left by Russia should be entirely filled out by 2024,and this excludes the effect that warmer weather has had on gas consumption.
by this logic,Japanese households should heat with oil instead of gas,and Japanese industry should have never existed in the first place.

a lot of new LNG capacity will come online in 2023-2024,especially in USA but also in Canada, Nigeria,Mozambique,Egypt.

"a lot" might be relatively a lot compared to previous LNG capacity, but it's nowhere near the capacity NS pipelines had. NS1 had a capacity of 55bcm per year, NS2 had a capacity of further 55bcm. A typical LNG terminals Germany is building has capacity of 5 to 8 BCM per year, and they are building 2 a year now. At this rate we will need over a fucking decade to fill that gap, and we will be paying 5x the price. Also there is that little thing with Germany re-classifying Russian gas as coming from Poland and Czechia because they transit through those countries.

Germany is not re-classifying Russian pipeline gas, and Russia has already stopped deliveries via Yamal (pipeline from Russia through Poland) in 2022….
The Budapest Memorandum pisses me off. It isn't explicit but if 'the west' expects countries to disarm nukes based on protection deals then any and all agression should trigger significant aid.
What nuclear weapons have shown to accomplish is that they act as a deterrence to war in general. Countries which possess nuclear weapons tend not to be attacked in part out of the fear that those nuclear weapons will be used. That has even been a reason for the measured response from NATO about sending aid to Ukraine.

Donating heavy equipment back then might have given Russia an excuse to invade much earlier, and the Ukrainian army might mot have been prepared.

So the only way to protect Ukraine would have been to literally fight the war for them with boots on the ground, US soldiers killing Russian soldiers. No one in Europe would have supported us and it would instantly begin WW3.

It sounds nice in theory, but you have to understand, there was no way to defend Ukraine's territory.

Ukraine didn't have an army prior to 2014 and even after the "Civil War" the large majority of fighting was done by ultra-nationalist Ukrainians who basically funded themselves, which is where you got all these stories of Ukraine being a "Hot-bed for nazis" because the people most likely to be willing to fight are going to be, militaristic right-wing ultra-nationalist.
imagine if Democrats demanded Congress to eliminate tax cuts passed in the last legislative session in order to keep the nation out of default.
Why don't Democrats introduce a fallback bill that does a clean debt limit increase, and when things start to come down to the wire see if there are 5 sane Republicans willing to vote with them to pass it?

In late 2021 Schumer refused to give into McConnell’s demands (similar to what House Republicans are doing now) and once the deadline was right around the corner McConnell ended up being forced to back down and Democrats raised the debt limit without strings attached. He even went as far as to agreeing to a temporary filibuster exemption so that Democrats can raise the debt ceiling on their own. When it comes to fighting for a clean raise of the debt ceiling Democrats aren’t as incompetent as you think.

They will once the deadline actually gets closer. They have until June, no need to rush now. Especially since as the deadline gets closer moderate republicans will start to feel the heat from their donors and will be more willing to negotiate.

Is that really true? I must’ve forgot when Democrats beat McConnell when he pulled the same shit in 2021.
Chinas population struggle will likely be even more severe than in Japan. But this is only a temporary problem, as genes favouring more children will slowly become more prominent.
Even longer perhaps, but those who have more children for whatever genetic reason will become more dominant. These social groups already exist, like Mormons in Utah or in Israel.

There can be a genetic component for example which attracts people to Mormonism. I don't see why outside of religious groups society would not move slowly in favour of those who have more children, and eventually whatever genes cause people to have more children will become more dominant. In fact evolutionarily it should be considered an eventuality, rather than an unlikely outcome. To assume it does not exist in the human genetic genepool already is likely to be false.

Yeah social groups, but you said genetic above. "Have more children" isn't really in the genetic wheelhouse of humans on any societal timeline (hell, I don't even think the needle has moved much on evolutionary timescales).
Unless I’m wrong, Kamala Harris only votes if there’s a tie. Even if Dems are 51 to 49, if Manchin and Sinema are both opposed, that’s still 51 nays to 49 yays, so no tiebreaker vote.
If we have 51 Dems that just means we get to cater to one less Dem, but we’re still stuck between Manchin or Sinema at any given moment which sucks.

It’s a problem with the way the Democrats work in general I think, less so the amount. Anything else than a total majority and everyone can be on the same side and say fuck the republicans, but once they’re in power, someone’s gonna take the position to gunk things up for the rest of them because now they have the power and they can, and the Dems are much less unified than Republicans have been in the past.

And of course, judicial confirmations, leading committees, and at least a chance, however small, of actually passing meaningful legislation even if the Dems lose the House (which it is looking like they probably will, but not definitive yet) because any Republican Majority in the House so far looks to be slim.

You have to take into consideration the trends historically of the sitting presidents party losing many seat and the fact that if thw gop didn't gerrymander every state they could we wouldn't be talking about who would take the house, because the democrats would have easily taken it if not for gerrymandering. Republicans stack the odds in thier favor and still lose. They're a dying party and we are witnessing the beginnings of that.
Among the other prominent accounts suspended were the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, an antifascist group that provides armed security for LGBTQ+ events in North Texas, and CrimethInc, an anarchist collective that has published and distributed anarchist and anti-authoritarian zines, books, posters, and podcasts since the mid-1990s.

Georgia could impose the death penalty on anyone giving water to anyone in line to vote because the water-giver was undermining democracy. Over the top? Look as the collection of Republican clowns with flamethrowers in the US House of Representatives before answering that question.
Complete elimination of ALL CRIME is unrealistic. Lots of offenders believe they won't get caught. They'd still commit the crime even if the potential penalty were death.

To be clearer, if both child rape and child murder carry the death penalty, what's the downside to eliminating the main witness after rape?

The death penalty for child rapists sounds appropriate, and I do believe these people have high recidivism rates, and are not to be trusted around children in any way. However, I also see the reasoning that if child rape carried the same penalty as murder, some of them would just kill the child to get rid of the victim so they can't be witnesses.

Gotta say I don’t have any sympathy for unanimously convicted child rapists receiving the death penalty if a super majority of a jury of their peers voted for it.

China’s exports to Russia has gone down to half from December 2021 to May/June 2022. Not sure if it has increased any substantial amount since then given the trajectory. I would assume China’s oil/gas imports from Russia however has increased at a reduced price that is very benefitial for China and a long term suicide for Russia.

The other side of it is a lot of countries are not buying russian oil or vastly reduced their intake in favour of other sources, meaning the buy from other countries/economies which is good for those economies. Standard market prices haven't dropped so everyone else selling oil is getting their regular price per barrel.

This price cap doesn't exist on any other oils products from other economies, it's purely a sanction against Russia. It's actually good for other economies who buy oil IF they want to buy russian sourced oil, coz they get it at a 33% discount.

The oil conglomerates and other economies generally set a maximum price per barrel they were willing to buy at(if at all) from Russian sources. A price cap.

Generally, oil prices are stable or slightly elevated. Russian oil prices are low. This weakens the rouble and doesn't negatively affect other currencies, so the rouble continues it's decline in purchasing power.
When someone tells you they want to do something awful even if they aren’t able to follow through it speaks to their values and priorities. That this is a priority for the GOP (one of the only actual policy positions they hold) instead of fixing it to ensure current and future generation workers get the full benefits they were promised and have been paying into for their entire lives should tell a reasonable person everything they need to know.
Unfortunately people who are still voting for republicans have a loose grip with reality and can no longer be described as reasonable thinkers.

Edit: You know what it is like? It is like when you get a phone call from someone selling something and they are answering any questions and responding as expected until you respond with something they weren't expecting. They pause and just repeat the last thing that was said, and then you realize you are talking to an AI. That's what debating is like with one of these MAGA people who are obviously just parroting back someone else's talking points. Once you respond with something outside their programming, they pause and then say something really general like how it is a shame the country is communist now.

I then remind him his kids and grandkids are those future generations and that obliviousness or lack of awareness that something was said occurs.

A lot of Palestinians were murdered during the Nabka, so you might have a hard time saying "this is 100% how this particular family was murdered", but make no mistake the Nabka was a horrible, deadly thing.
A portion of the Palestinian population of Israel got mad at the nation being formed, attacked the Jewish population, lost the fight and rather than executing all of them, some of whom had family who'd be neighbors to the people who would be killed, they were exiled to preserve the peace.

People claiming the nabka is ethnic cleansing are the ones trying to justify ethnic cleansing of Jewish people in the middle east in 1948 and on.

For all intents and purposes, the 1948 Nakba was a genocide of Palestinians, or at the very least an ethnic cleansing. Yet, sadly, very few dare to call it as such, despite it bearing the hallmarks of such a definition; it was deliberate, and it intended to destroy the Palestinian Arab ethnicity in part or in whole by expelling them from their homes and destroying hundreds of their villages and towns, leading to the shattering of their society. This lead to the creation of permanent Palestinian refugees with no right of returning to their homes.

If I recall correctly the Jordanian excuse was to give housing to the mass of Palestinian refugees they now had to deal with.

That isn't ethnic cleansing that is mass instability caused by mass immigration and sudden demographic change causing hate and unrest in the populace leading to atrocities like the riots. Blame of which rests on the British authorities.

And the instability was the Hebron massacre and the wave of racial violence in the decades leading up to the 1947 civil war, of which both sides committed atrocities.

The nakba also predates the 1948 war, it was started during the 1947 civil war. Do yourself a favor and actually read up on Israels history.
I don't see Finland saying no (nor "we'll just join with Sweden later") to joining if ratified, but the constantly growing amount of hoop jumping demanded for possible ratification has become too mutch even for finnish politicans.
It’s great how Finland and Sweden are sticking together and everything but I’ll admit, Finland specifically joining NATO would be such a blow to Russia that I’d almost rather defer to Turkey on Sweden if it meant Finland would still join up.

Look at the choice from Finland's point of view: Being in NATO protects Finland to the extent that they expect Russia to attack Finland and puts Finland in danger to the extent that they expect a NATO-Russia war to happen over something else. Given the damage it has suffered in Ukraine, Russia isn't going to have the strenh to attack Finland for years. It's far more likely that NATO will end up at war with Russia as a result of something happening in Ukraine than it is that Russia will invade Finland soon. So, it makes sense for them to wait for Sweden so that Sweden's NATO membership can ameliorate the risk of being drawn into a war with Russia.

If NATO decided to intervene in Ukraine, would Sweden be willing to take the risk of participating in the fighting even after NATO wouldn't have them? What if the war was over Russia's invasion of Turkey? If Finland is in NATO, there are a whole bunch of reasons they might end up at war with Russia besides an attack on Finland, and mutual defense pacts don't cover those.

My answer: because being in NATO makes it possible that Finland will be pulled into a war with Russia. This most likely cause would be if the Ukraine conflict escalates. And in that case, being in NATO without Sweden means being at war with a country with which Finland shares a massive land border and not having the support of the powerful and nearby Swedish navy and air force.

Swedish influence was a big part of Finnish history and I’d like to think that our relationship has been very good at least since after the Finnish civil war and through Sweden coming to Finland’s aid during WW2.

Yes we have, sort of. Finland was colonised and belonged to Sweden for 600 years, until we essentially lost it to russia. After the russian revolution Finland was independent.
It's hardly unprecedented. Get 100,000 of your own men killed in a war no one asked for, piss off the entire planet (including your allies like China) and tank your already-failing economy, and you give a lot of people reasons to want you dead.
Putin clearly had a chip on his shoulder with Ukraine, and felt like he had nothing to lose. (Maybe the rumors of his illness had something to do with that.) I don't think the rest of the Russian mafia state is so inclined, and certainly wouldn't make the mistake of concentrating so much power into one person again.

However what might happen is that a decredibilised Putin or a new leader of Russia would not have the same iron grip over the political class. So a crisis like the would resolve differently. This would mean that other offices of the Russian Federation, that have their own legitimacy, or certain oligarchs that can buy popularity in their own fief, would become much harder to touch for the presidency.

Unfortunately, Putin's subordinates have the power to control the army organizations & Russia even its citizens. What's more, Wagner's mercenaries can kill boldly Russian protestors who wish to push down Putin's regime. But most Russian citizens don't have the guts to try that since they are men in the street, not superheroes. However, Zelenskyy's comment might annoy Putin's psychological status a little by little. If Zelenskyy aims to spark Putin's rage, it would be a successful one.

“While Sanders and King formally caucus with Democrats, Sinema declined to explicitly say that she would do the same. She did note, however, that she expects to keep her committee assignments – a signal that she doesn’t plan to upend the Senate composition, since Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer controls committee rosters for Democrats.”.
This move lets her continue to play "President Sinema", forcing Schumer and Biden to continue to acquiesce to her demands for attention and favorable treatment (like committee chairmanships).

Of course China wants chips. Russia wants chips. Everyone does. No one goes it alone, right now. No one can today. The US is bringing more chip fab back home, but those projects are a decade out, and all it's going to do is make us more internationally shock resistant, not independent. If China and Russia want to do it alone... They just... can't... Both countries demographics are inverted pyramids - they have more older people than younger people. Russia has a population of 143 million, but only 8.4 million between 20-40, and Putin has pledged to send up to 2 million of those to die in a war. There isn't going to be a Russia in 10 years. China isn't faring much better, by 2050 their population is going to reduce by HALF. There isn't going to a China anymore. They don't have enough people left, neither of them, to innovate, because they don't have enough people left to hold their own shit together in the first place.

Nothing about China is what the propaganda would lead you to believe. They're not an economic powerhouse because they're entirely dependent. Their economy only exists by the good graces of the US IN THE FIRST PLACE. China is an empire over conquered regions, they were never unified until recent history. The China you know today has only existed for 70 years, though as they tell it, they've always been this singularly large country.

Their economy only exists by the good graces of the US IN THE FIRST PLACE. China is an empire over conquered regions, they were never unified until recent history. The China you know today has only existed for 70 years, though as they tell it, they've always been this singularly large country.
China, industrializing as hard and fast as they could; in Xi Jinping's mind, a world where he cannot possibly imagine deglobalization, his world which we made on purpose, why make what you can buy? It's cheaper and easier that way. China does participate in chip fab, but all of it is imported, the tech, the materials, the knowledge, the software, the people. Because of Biden's CHIPS act, all of that is gone. And with that, all their supposed innovating that they were doing on high speed rail, for example, all their research, and principally because they decided to build hypersonic missiles so they could target the US if they had to, everything China has ever done to innovate is going to die along with their inability to get anything. They're sanctioned, and now they can't get the software from the US, they can't get the hardware from anywhere else, and the people they relied on were all US - so Biden said to those people, either give up your jobs, or give up your US citizenship.
But the judge specifically channeled the will of our founding fathers, you know those revolutionaries who fought for change and progress to improve the lives of US citizens, and decided they would have been conservatively against change and progress.
The judge, appointed by Donald Trump, said that from a historical perspective the ban was "an outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted.".

Right. And if you look at the last two amendments out of ten, it's a ratified reminder that the Constitution is not a Magna Carta, literally because those debating the Bill of Rights were worried that people would make exactly the error you're making. They went out of their way to try to stop you from making that error, but unfortunately, in order to work, it still does require that you both read and understand the entire Bill of Rights at a minimum. Ideally, you'd also have a decent civics education.

This is one of those areas of the law where the plain text and meaning of the Constitution simply cannot coexist in any coherent, consistent way with the state's desire to make people safer. One of the two has to give, and a shocking number of people on this one issue will suggest that, not only should it be the Constitution, but that it should be the Constitution without a formal amendment having to be ratified.

It's literally what nazis did, as time goes on they keep making the "us" group narrower. Now Israel's new (even more) far right government is straight up saying if you're not Orthodox you're not Jewish enough.
If you tell any right-winged Israeli about how similar their behavior is to countries like Iran, they'll always retort with the same "this is a Jewish country for Jews, if you don't like it you can move".

That means that if every non-religious Israeli took the advice of "just pack up and leave if you're unhappy" the country would quite literally economically collapse.

Which is ironic because, on average, the non-religious Israeli pays 6 times as many taxes as the orthodox one, essentially bankrolling their child support and the paycheck they receive from the government to study the Bible.

If you want to not pay taxes / social security, you have to have lived somewhere else for a prolonged period (I believe about 2 years, out of which 183 days in every year have to be out of country).
How is it possible to believe that she sent those emotional, overwrought texts to Mark Meadows, but didn't discuss anything with her own husband? It's just not plausible.
That's what would happen. The right-wing on the SCOTUS have no interest in lessening their power and there is no mechanism that would keep Thomas off the bench.

The current Supreme Court cannot be taken seriously. It’s members stopped vote counting in Bush v. Gore and one member’s wife sought to play a role in denying the election results. Thomas refused to recuse him from cases in which his own wife was involved.

Permitless carry or "constitutional carry" normally means concealed, but can apply to open also depending on the state.
I only skimmed the article but does permitless carry mean concealed carry? Or are they saying that open carry is now allowed in nearly half the states?

A big trend over the last 5 years or so is for more states to become "constitutional carry" states. Basically, as long as you can legally own a gun, you can carry that gun.

Carrying a gun may be legal, but menacing is not. Anyone who is doing literally anything with a firearm that is not secured in the slightest will have to speak to the police.

Having less guns on the street by making it more difficult for law abiding citizens to carry is not the fix you think it is.

Our laws suppress rights by simply trying to limit the amount of guns in public in the name of public safety while not addressing the causes of violence in the first place. They certainly aren't successful at discouraging criminals who somehow got a gun and carries it regardless.
The glad-handing behavior by telling content creators what they can and can’t do via threatening their livelihood is bad. If it’s not harassment, calls to action for violence, or porn YouTube should stay out of it. Advertisers have to advertise on YouTube. It’s the biggest video platform on the internet. Advertisement is a numbers game. As long as people watch YouTube creators, ad space will be bought. But, if creators are so bogged down with stupid rules that try to make sure everyone is a sanitized, milquetoast employee of weenie hut junior’s, people will stop watching. We are human, we want to watch people who are their genuine self, not some corpo’d watered down version of who someone is.
Swearing is ok. Talking about sensitive subjects is ok. Being someone who doesn’t conform to the mainstream is ok. Being your honest, authentic self is ok. Dissent is ok. If YouTube continues to dangle monetization over creators heads unless they conform, the content will get worse and worse until creators stop creating because they can’t be themselves, and we’ll stop watching because we can tell when someone is being a phony.

we're at a point where youtubers censor themself while talking or say "oh i can't say what i wanted to say because otherwise i get demonetized" or "F....aaantastic!". its so extreme that it is annoying to hear everytime "oh i can't say what i wanted to say otherwise i get censored" etc.. you can't watch videos anymore without hearing it again and again. and as a youtuber its hell to always find out what the reason for it is this time. youtube don't tells you its exact rules and things you need to look out for, so you have to try and experiment for countless hours to find out what the problem is by editing your video to death. it sucks.

i agree with you, some people over-do it. in such cases i think it is okay to prevent children from seeing it (i mean, youtube has a age restricted video feature for a reason). but even if you're an adult and verify your age.. youtube still censors it. they could just restrict such videos (who have TOO much swearing in them.. like 20-50+ in a 10min video or something like that) so only adults can watch them or similiar. but treating adults like they are children who need to get "protected" from "evil things" is just dumb.
Asteroids are waaaaaay more economically viable to mine, and we already have the technology to mine them.
Getting to Mars is a matter of human achievement and research opportunities. There are virtually no economic drivers to reaching Mars or building a base, but we'll do it anyways. There was no economic driver for the initial missions to the moon either.

Ok but you also can't move planets closer to earth. Commercial mining of asteroids would involve first bringing them into earth's orbit, which is actually quite straightforward. We already have all the technology to mine asteroids, it's just not economically viable yet. Meanwhile even getting to Mars, let alone setting up mining colonies is going to be a massive undertaking.

Its a combination of materials and secrets. Nuclear technology is very much at the top of the “tech tree”—you need to be able to source basically everything from inside your own country. Gas centrifuges used to enrich the uranium require very careful engineering or they will shake themselves apart. They also spin very very fast so they make them from a high tensile strenh steel called marraging steel. If you can’t make or acquire this steel then you don’t have centrifuges. This is just one example out of a million in the line from raw uranium to weapons grade.
U-233 exists and is technically weapons grade, can be created via the thorium fuel cycle but has its own set of hurdles. U-238 can also undergo fission in the right circumstances, mainly fast and high energy neutron flux generated from a fusion reaction. In the case of modernish thermonuclear weapons, 40%+ of the total energy released can come from the U-238 bomb case and other components.

The hard part of making nuclear weapons is the enrichment of the uranium or plutonium. It takes a long time for the "inputs" to go through the facility and come out on the other end as the enriched "outputs", on the order of six months to a year. This is how weapons inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) work. They turn up randomly every few months, too fast for an end-to-end run of enrichment to get to weapons-grade purity.

Iran previously tried to make a "run" to weapons grade uranium, but the US attacked their plant with a computer virus called Stuxnet and imposed severe sanctions. Seriously, go read up about that virus, it's an amazing story all by itself. The US managed to smuggle it into a network protected by an air gap by leaving infected USB sticks in nearby campuses!

Wait so ... If my company office is at O'Hare plaza... They are legally required to give me sick time? Currently I only get pto and I need to use that for sick days.....
Getting paid sick days in addition to paid time off was such a trip for me. Never having them before was a weird hesitancy to use them because I'm in America and you work through it! This year I only get 20 days vacation and basically unlimited sick as well, crazy concept in the US to have over a month of the year off and sick time.

It's a good start at least. I think this is one of those situations that people need to sort of ease into it. We're a week becomes clearly commonplace so adding a week on top of it isn't such a drastic change that people get mad at for some reason.

The real joke is how much some people make how much, or how hard they work as part of their identity. I've seen and heard the "40hrs a week? I remember my first part time job!" Like it's a badge of honor. I get paid pretty well in a union job, I work my 40 and go home to enjoy time with my family and hobbies.
But we won’t, because then we’d have to admit that our entire governing system is flawed and archaic.
Or we could join the rest of the civilised democratic world and finally get around to making a written constitution. One that includes protective laws for protesting.

Violent protests exist, you know? The Tories aren’t just being evil for the sake of it. People need to try to look at things from different perspectives instead of the mindless Marxist mentality.

You can't ask for people to look at things from different perspectives and call people who have a different perspective than you "mindless marxists". It's not reasonable.

It's good to have a balance of both. However, it definitely needs reform and getting rid of cash for peerage corruption etc. Ideally, it should be made of a cross-section of society, community-minded people and academic experts to be fully representative.

The problem with elected officials is they often only care about popular in that moment, knee-jerk, short-term issues, rather than long-term issues like climate change.
It’s really not that big of a deal. Nerva was found to be the most efficient and reliant engine. It had a high ISP and only needed a hydrogen mono propellant to be used. And it had the benefit of constantly giving electrical energy.
That’s not at all a problem. And one thing, nerva isn’t a nuclear reactor it uses a small amount of fissile material to heat up liquid hydrogen into heated gas. And the small amount isn’t even much of an issue if it explodes because it’s so small it wouldn’t cause much fallout. All your thinking about is a bunch of anti nuclear propaganda pushed by coal and oil companies to keep peddling their shitty products.

And in what way do we need to cart about fallout in space? The engine thrust isn’t enough to lift anything off the ground, it would be reserved for space activities only.

Those worries where from when Nerva was fist conceived in the 60’s. We’ve reached the point in our control of nuclear substances that the chances of problems arising are almost nonexistent. Modern reactors are so safe a literal child could use them without blowing it up.

I mean, the reactors would never blow up, they’d melt down and spread radiation over a wide area, but that’s a moot point.

The risky part is getting the reactors safely into space, or at least far enough away to not cause widespread fallout from an exploded rocket.

Before the average person reads this and freaks out, nuclear rockets are ONLY used in space (which is already filled with deadly radiation). They are not used to launch rockets inside the Earth’s atmosphere.
I'm not sure, but I heard (someone correct me if I'm wrong) that green berets do a lot of ground/espionage work. Assessing the political/cultural landscape through immersion, destabilizing regimes, toppling governments, and all that. I'm guessing navy seals are more combat oriented.
There are different tiers of Navy Seals. The "normal" Navy SEALs are of course elite, but are comparable to other Special Operations forces like Army Rangers, Green Berets, MARSOC, etc. Although they all have different roles, specialties, and training, which can explain differences in training costs.

I wouldn't be surprised if $1.5M is how much it costs to train an SF soldier to the bare minimum to qualify for placement on a team. Those guys never stop training, the veterans who have been in for years will have had much more money invested in their training over that time.

DEVGRU aka Seal Team Six is made up of the best veteran SEALs, and would be considered to be more elite than all the aforementioned because they're picked from an already-elite group. Those are the guys that were sent to get Bin Laden. Alongside Delta Force (which is similarly made up of the best Rangers and Green Berets) they're probably the most elite combat units in the US military.
This is how you get a Ukraine working towards being nuclear armed by any means. Countries like France etc don't seem to understand that this is an existential crisis for Ukraine and they don't intend to ever give Russia the opportunity to do this again. In years to come when Europe has a Ukraine pulling clandestine actions for self preservation some leaders will act all surprised. But the general public won't be.
One thing is obvious, when it comes to Russia and Ukraine, there's no going back to the status quo or handicapping Ukraine to appease Russia. France hasn't yet understood this.

It is obvious that in order to survive Ukraine has to have nuclear capacity or conventional equivalent. With potential to deliver destruction to Russian territory.

You are assuming too much. Ukraine needs to be able to defend itself and strike Russia on its own territory. Just as Poland.
Uhhh no? The Taliban didn't have much in the way of anti-aircraft capabilities. Air-dropping supplies into territory controlled by sandal-wearing insurgents is an entirely different story than air-dropping supplies into the middle of the country with the second-largest military in Europe.

NATO is already there, as a member and an important one at that. Don't expect some kind of righteous intervention, the world doesn't work that way. It all comes down to what serves NATO best and is it a small member in financial ruin or is it the most powerful in the region and a foothold in the middle east as well as on Russias flank?

The most cynical view of what's best for NATO is to defend Greece and partition Turkey into smaller more easily controlled puppet states. (As current Turkey doesn't obey when ordered.).
They're also incredibly advantageous to Poland. Despite what some folks around these parts might want to believe, Poland is the next stop for Russia, if Putin is able to somehow take Ukraine. Putin wants to test Article 5 and the resolve of NATO's members, because he has more to gain if his gamble is correct than he would stand to lose if he was wrong. Poland giving aid to Ukraine helps to prevent that eventuality from ever happening at all, down the line.
No one was criticizing the amount of aid poland sent to Ukraine. He was saying that the constant attack on Germany and basically lying about certain issues (leo request etc.) is a election tactic by polish politicians who are about to hold a election.

This is why a lot of people call what poland is doing political posturing. Because they are basically lying about the facts to create the narrative that Germany is still doing fuck all because they are about to face elections in Poland and thats a popular position to hold in poland.

If they take Ukraine, they'll see much more... enthusiastic allied participation from their friends -- Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, Belarus. They're not individually powerful by any means, but the common thread between them is deep experience with geurilla warfare and fomenting radical insurgencies... which happen to be the tools that are most useful to Russia right now for disrupting the West.
Had my first (& only) child 2 years ago & promptly left Florida for a more rational state. That place is a dumpster fire in all respects. Only going to get worse.
It's going to get worse. They are currently training teachers on a computer program where the kids will teach them themselves and the teachers only monitor the students. No hands on anything.

He is absolutely correct too. I have a relative who works in Duval county, and classroom library shelves are empty or covered in the elementary grades. They are only allowed to use the books that come with the state curriculum. The county doesn't want to risk getting in trouble and let's face it, what teacher wants to get felony charged or lose their license over this.

Even if it’s right, this teacher will be stripped of his teaching license, and probably have his house swatted in front of his family and be arrested.

A lot of popular NA music is about drugs, they find kids hopped up on drugs after a vist to the dentist to be funny, etc. It's not enough to have intermittent efforts to stump out drug use, which is what you're referring to, there needs to be a sustained effort, which politicians and law enforcement are not capable of carrying because they don't see drug use as a big deal, because it's part of the culture.

I can't speak for this decriminalization measure, but typically they're aimed to provide more care for drug users, ensuring what they're doing is safe and clean, and that there are resources for those that have issues with drugs.

Even if it's not as effective as promised, pretty much anything at this point is better than the sick societal self harm that is drug prohibition.

The data isn't fully conclusive that decriminalization makes everything better, but it is conclusive that the war on drugs does more harm than good.

Studies show decriminalisation along with offering treatment to be the most effective way to deal with drug problems. Posturing about being tough on drugs has been a complete waste of money and police time for nothing more than a virtue signal.
To be fair Israel is becoming a text book example of fascism, it’s not all the way there yet but it’s definitely heading that direction. the way Israel treats Palestinians is awfully reminiscent of how other fascist governments treated marginalized groups that they used as a scape goat.
Palestinians have been saying this for 70 years and people like Ehud Barak just pretended that it was antisemitism instead of a genuine description of Israeli politics.

At this point I am worried if Israel is not already stuck in a self-perpetuating cycle of right-radicalisation. I really hope it is not, and that it is just a temporary weakness of the pro-peace majority.

Zionism does not necessarily mean "violently taking over all the land we can". Obviously it can, and it does mean that for some, but I do not see a reason why the two-state solution should not satisfy Zionism's goals.

Zionism is compatible with a two state solution, therefore I don't agree at all that the current situation is the logical conclusion of Zionism. Had the peace talks in the 90s and early 2000s been successful, we'd be in a very different reality, fully not fascist and fully compatible with Zionism. The reason we are where we are is because fascism is the logical conclusion of a prolonged, slow cooked hopeless conflict. Israelis aren't only the one getting more militant and extreme, so are the Palestinians, the process unfortunately works both ways.
I’ve had this conversation with my dad. I don’t think, on the whole, people are getting dumber. It’s just that the internet (and social media) have allowed dumb people with stupid ideas to find each other and be collectively loud now that they have a platform.
its a lot easier for the morons to find each other on social media and its allowed them to amplify their voices attracting more morons to their stupidity.

I think they're just saying that social media makes propaganda easier to distribute than ever, which is true. With all the data they take, they know which ones to target. Algorithms push people not paying attention to the far right.

I bet we all know at least one person who used to be "normal" who is now on social media regurgitating far-right talking points. I've heard some shocking things out of the blue from computer illiterate, mostly older people who get all their news on social media. Like, things Nazis would say. They were always conservative, they were always morons. Social media supercharges hate and it's way worse when there's zero moderation on the platform.
What video proof? The films only show the president was shot, not who shot him. Why are there no bullets recovered from Kennedy’s body? Why were other rifles found in the book depository? Why does every eye witness place Oswald on another floor at the time of the shooting? There is so much contradictory evidence that modern forensics calls nonsense on. Learn about Oswald.
Why would he renounce his American citizenship, and leave for Russia exactly when powers was shot down. Did you know Oswald worked at a u2 spy base in Japan prior? Next, he comes back to the US with a Russian wife, and they say sure come back we forgive you. Come on. He’s not even a us citizen, in fact he’s a defector.

After reading a lot and going over evidence, it was a very coordinated event. The fact that a second team was prepping in another city sealed it for me. The CIA had their hands all over it. Also, completely ignoring eye witness testimony, not to mention the magic bullet left completely intact on the gurney. Lol, the photoshop of Lee Harvey holding the gun. So much bullshit.

This Article was garbage. The headline was longer than the body… “attorney was fired. They say she want for that reason. Epstein killed himself.”.

No. It’s not an oversimplification. Businesses are at the mercy of the consumers. Period. People CHOOSE to spend their money with shit companies. Saying otherwise is bullshit. No one needs to shop at Walmart. If you have no money, shop at thrift stores and overstock stores. Cut out processed food & meat. Buy cheap, nonprocessed foods like dry beans, dry rice, discounted fresh produce, dry pasta, canned tomatoes, bulk cheese, etc. It is a myth that poor people can’t afford healthy food. Stop spreading bullshit. And before you say it, I am well aware of food desserts. I have lived in food deserts for most of my adult life. Most folks are just lazy & apathetic. People want everything handed to them.
Ah, there's the "people want everything handed to them" voice. I was wondering when you would show up. I find no conversation is complete without your particularly bitter flavor of self-righteousness.

I still have to drive to work. I cannot afford an electric car. But I can vote for local politicians with plans to increase walkabikity in places, and funding for public transportation. I can continue to volunteer with the Chedapeake Bay Foundation for clean-up and protection of the oyster reefs.
That's just it. They absolutely, adamantly, refuse to do anything that might even hint at moderating any of their policies or planks. The ratchet can only go further to the right.
This has been part of the problem all along, because they've responded to electoral setbacks with anything BUT that, and everytime anyone suggests moderating to broaden the appeal, they get shouted down and more or less kicked out. (Seriously, go try it on r/conservative sometime. At least if you don't mind getting banned there, from what I hear.).

So no - Democrats clearly cheated somehow, or rigged things. It's the media's fault (liberal bias!) for bad coverage, not because the Republicans literally fielded awful extremist candidates. In this case they seem to be blaming Ranked Choice Voting, despite the fact that a lack of it would not have helped them - had Palin defeated Begich in a Republican primary, she'd still have lost to Peltola, because RCV literally was just a shortcut of that in this instance.

Probably not - the traditional Republican closed primary would have consolidated the party behind Palin… at which point all their energy would have focused on attacking Peltola instead of each other.

It’s interesting cycle though because Palin and Peltola seem to have genuine respect for each other from Palin’s time as Governor and they avoided direct attacks for the most part.
Those issues are months off, and if a crisis comes up that needs a semi-functioning House before that then the Democrats could just lend their votes to one side or the other and end this stalemate. That's the beauty of this situation; as long as the Republicans can't get together then the Democrats have full control over when it ends.
On the one hand—poetic justice for the anti-governing party that can’t even get their shit together long enough to form a governing coalition to elect a Speaker. On the other, there’s always the possibility McCarthy has to swear to do some batshit damaging stunt in order to secure the votes he needs, like defaulting on the debt or something.

While it is funny, once they eventually settle on a Speaker there’s a very good chance that the ultra right wing will be disproportionately powerful in controlling the agenda, House investigations, prime committee assignments, etc. and given their disinterest in the common good, this doesn’t bode particularly well for America.
I’ve got a family member who got a felony when he was 18. His legal debt to society was fulfilled decades ago. He got a trade and became very successful in his profession. He’s now a business owner.
You’d think that there should have been a federal lawsuit ages ago to standardize voting for people with felony convictions that have fulfilled their sentences in federal elections. It’s ridiculous states have different election standards and someone can just move to a different state to get their rights back to vote for president.

The constituencies are so different, I don't think the gerrymandered legislature should be able to essentially elect the governor if they can't serve or get removed.

Yep it allows the (gerrymandered) legislature to remove a popularly elected governor and replace him with the (gerrymandered) speaker of the house instead of the popularly elected lieutenant gov.

Thinking about it though, I'm guessing the 2 amendment was so that if TN ever gets another Democratic governor, if the legislature removes him they can replace him with the Speaker instead of the Lt. Governor...
Shit happens when you're trigger happy. Not excusing it, but I see absolutely no reason for Russia to "attack" Poland, especially some farm with no strategic value. Also why the hell would Russia want to invade Poland?
Ok, so maybe Poland does have value to Russia BUT as you said, it would mean a war with NATO and I don't think it's that valuable to Russia, like at all.

Having that in mind it seems that NATO is backpedaling leaving Poland vulnerable - it reminds Poles situation from September 1939, don't you think?

It is unlikely to be fired by Ukrainians as their AA batteries aim EASTwards not west-wards as anti rocketry system does isn't build for chasing rockets but for colliding with them midair.

If it's a Ukrainian missile it may have been trying to shoot down a Russian missile heading west and has missed meaning the Ukrainian missile could have been chasing it but missed and kept going west /north west to Poland. Or it's a Russian missile that has over shot Ukraine. All guessing of cause. I don't see it being deliberate but who knows these days.
Oh man, I love when Trump lovers try to pretend they know what's going on. The regulations (multiple) that were dropped during his presidency allowed the state to relax safety regulations on trains.
So yes, the regulation regarding train breaks would not have specifically helped. However it paired with the regular safety audits that were cut as part of different regulation likely would have.

So yea, no matter how bad it makes you feel, this is because of a Trump admin decision. Nice try though.

Edit: The politifact article you posted is resting on a technicality. The regulations wouldn't have applied because it wasn't classified as carrying dangerous cargo, which is an extremely narrow definition. One of the regulations that would have likely gotten this train reclassified would have been the required safety audits that were dropped along with the break requirements.

Since the NTSB isn't making the link and you are, let's see your documentation and justification about the cause and how it relates to specific Trump regulation changes.

Oh how fun. I'm not anything remotely related to a Trump lover and would be absolutely be relieved if he was indicted and could be removed from politics overall. But the NTSB has specifically stated that Trump's regulation changes did not impact the derailment.

So you have no regulations to point to that Trump cut that specifically impacted the derailment. You also don't have any specific state regulations that were relaxed directly because of a Trump action. But, but but, if the brake regulation hadn't been cut and if more regulations that were never enacted... specifically ones that were previously excluded from the actual regulation during previous administrations... if those were enacted, then it might have maybe been different.
Reddit Revolutionaries love romanticizing communist propaganda but simply refuse to accept that the propaganda was just bullshit, the revolutions resulted in a lot of people being murdered by the state or starved and a couple of generations later its just capitalism in a more authoritarian state.
The same people who cheekily share communist propaganda can't name a point in history where communism actually delivered on its promises. Then have the stones to say "We'll we've never really tried it, maybe it'll work when we do it!".

P.S. Also, much LOL for thinking that claiming asylum is an easy thing that anyone could just do. Even before the war famous activits who had convictions of their record has about 10% success rate in Europe. Nowawadays even that is a dream in the sky.

Had he simply remained in Berlin while announcing times and locations on Telegram (the last unblockable media in the russia), you would have seen action both significantly larger and longer, I have little doubt of that. However, he'd also almost certainly would not feel morally right calling on people to accept risk without sharing it.

Same way it was done for the past 10 years: even if time and place are known to the police, you stick to them and hope to bring enough people that they can't just arrest everyone.
I'm convinced people who argue for gas stoves can't or don't cook and instead want something to complain about.
Slower than my electric, can't hold an accurate oven temp for shit, let's enormous amounts of waste heat into the room, and is an absolute nightmate to clean.

I would much rather have a gas cooktop than electric. The heating is easier to control and reacts faster to changes. There’s a reason why most professional kitchens use gas cooktops.

I use gas in my kitchen. You can pry the gas from my kitchen from my cold dead hands. I don't think banning these is the right way, because, you know, "freedom". But if you were to offer significant stimulus options to make non-gas alternatives far cheaper, I'd also consider it.

Youre not wrong, but Im not convinced that banning gas will do much. Corporations have spent decades spending money to make consumers think their home use is a major contributor when corporations still vastly outpace home use.
Nah, it was never about actually criticising the cozy relationships between gaming journalism and the game industry. That was all BS, the gamergaters never cared about a studio bribing journalists for AAA games, or for blacklisting people for negative coverage and the like - not unless it invovled something they hated anyway.
While gamergate may have started off as a criticism of video games journalism and the good old boys club of AAA gaming, I do think that Rumblings of the sorts of harassment campaigns occurred with Anita Sarkeesian far before that. That said, I don't think that you are far off by suggesting that video game fans from both the left and the right ended up glomming onto it because they saw some form of benefit in the burgeoning attention economy. It was a distraction and a politicization of popular culture that was used to create an almost Lifestyle brand out of identitarian Politics on both sides of the aisle and I think that ultimately has been bad for any form of nuanced conversation about politics or governments.

Making sure that it was grammatically correct, even if it was a little awkward without commas, was the hardest part; I wanted to make sure that people recognize that I am inferring not only correlation but also a coordinated causation.

Same thing with road fatalities: Roads were for everyone but after mass protest about all the child deaths at the wheels of the new automobiles tearing through them with no warning, mass campaigns paid for by Ford, etc., accusing people of "jay-walking" (jay being another term for hick or hillbilly) eventually became codified in law. Again, deflecting blame from the companies that make dangerous things and onto the individual for the state of the commons.
Same thing with littering: mass ad campaigns paid for by Coca-Cola, etc., made you a "litterbug" when previously it was on the companies for stopping using recyclable bottles, etc.

That's really damn sad. Whoever's job it is to look after these fish must be devastated. You only have healthy tropical aquariums at the hands of people who care.
Not uncommon in aquariums. Water exerts a massive amount of outward pressure on the glass. Usually, it’s caused by a tank being unlevel because then that portion of the tank gets more pressure than the rest.

A normal aquarium, you can, at least in theory, move animals to a different area, drain an area, remove and replace fatigued material. But for this, I can't see any way to deal with it at all. You'd basically need a second tank of roughly the same size, and have to remove and replace the entire cylinder.

instead of aiming for the worlds largest tank, they could’ve had more small, safe and attractive looking tanks. with live plants, etc etc.
For so many years, decades even, russia has been living off this fear they presented to the world. Of their army, of their military might, their military weapons, their military intelligence. They showed themselves as ravenous bears on the battlefield. In reality, that masquerade popped as though that ravenous bear was truthfully a balloon bear.
While this war is not over, I believe it will irreparably reshape the forces of power in Europe and Asia.

I find this fascinating. This war is horrible, but as an observer of military conflicts and one who studies past wars in history, this has been very interesting. Between the determination of the Ukrainian army, citizens, and leaders, to the idiotic choices of russia and their military incompetence.

Personally... a "tiny" bit of me wishes the collective allied forces would just do a joint operation to wipe out Russia's front-line; just a quick 24 hour operation and then back-off.
I can get betting against Ukraine back in February 2022. But I'd hope people would have reassessed the situation and their mindset by now, after all that's happened and not happened.
But then three days passed and Kyiv still stood free. And then a week. Two weeks. A month. And then the Russians were retreating from that entire front. And then the Ukrainians pushed Russians back on two more fronts too.

But still pushing south from Russia to kyiv would still be a difficult task. It failed at the beginning of the war. Now Ukraine is more experienced and equipped.

Russia has lost other wars, there's no reason to think they can't lose this war. Whether they want to or whether they decide to stop, has little to do with it.

Ukraine will become a member of NATO and arm themselves beyond what we've seen from any other nation. They'll erect defences between them and the Russian border that'll stand for more that 100 years.
“Our planet is in crisis,” Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, said in a press conference earlier this month. More than a million species are threatened with extinction, she said, and populations of most major animal groups have declined by an average of 69 percent. “Clearly, the world is crying out for change,” she said.'.
Ehh. 20 years ago we had 1 year to change or we will all peril or wish we did. We didn't change so I expect it is all over no matter what...unless the science changed and this climate thing is less severe than thought?

Thank God but how do we know they're right this time? I think we are not supposed to question it, but if no one ever questions it, how do we know when we're wrong like we have been in the past?

I'm also open to the idea I'm wrong! I listed some of the horrible, scary predictions. What's the scariest prediction that has actually come true?

What is the scariest prediction that came true? There have been years of threats that are designed to make it sound like ahumanity is at risk and all of our lives will be drastically different by now . Look at old articles.from 20 years ago. Scary but it has all been noise. I'm thinking about no polar ice, increased severe hurricanes in the US, mass flooding if Florida ( remember the map that showed Florida almost completely underwater by now) or the like.
Well, I see what you're saying and I don't disagree. But I also don't think that's what I'm doing. I've read them all as well as their contemporary Shoepenhauer, I've also read some eastern philosophy and was a history major and can say I think the "But the Nazi's co-opted Neitzche" is the revisionist / apologist position. All the 19th century German philosophers were upper class elitists, that's the perspective they came from and that's what the Nazi's were looking for when they went shopping for validation. From Neitzche to Nazi was an evolution, not a theft.
Neitzche, Jung, Freud all did it, and it's part of the reason I think their ideas / philosophies are garbage. Modern right wing thinkers like Nick Land also promote the idea.

Sure. But making broad statements isn't very conclusive of anything. I'm not saying that drugs or taking your body to the extremes is a recipe for enlightenment, but in the same breath I don't want to stop people exploring ideas and taking things further. Nor do I wish to encourage people to not step out of their comfort zones and echo chambers. Afterall none of us know anything about consciousness or our environment.
Stop the Iran deal which will give them access of billions in frozen assets and sanctions relief, which will they use to produce more drones and ballistic missiles to spread terror and instability in the Middle East and else where, like Ukraine.
Iran: is supplying hundreds of drones used to target critical civil infrastructure before winter and is in talks in supplying more as well as ballistic rockets that will have it's main objective to destroy the power grid of a country in winter.(that can lead to a humantirian catastrophe at the scale of 40 mil people).

Instead of stopping it in Ukraine you will now have to stop it in Poland/Baltics/Moldova but now also with extra forces from ukraine.

Now you have russia AND Ukraine that will be mobilized to fight further. Because remember - russia openly threatens other european countries and says it's at war with NATO.

Are you claiming that Ukraine - war torn, devastated by Russia's unprovoked invasion, desperately fighting off a much larger country - is planning to invade Iran? This makes so little sense it might have been written by a bot that randomly generates conspiracy theories.
He is the only old politician I would recommend voting for again despite his age. Other than that every country in the world need to replace old politicians with younger ones that bring new ideas and ideology.
Not from US but while I would prefer younger people in politics no matter what country, Joe Biden have been an amazing president actually getting shit done.

That said, I feel that younger people might have reservations about voting for someone that old. It's important to have a candidate who is relatable, and Biden might just not appeal to younger voters in 2024.

Sadly, I think Biden wanted to be retired. He probably still wants to retire. But the question is if not him, who?

That being said, Biden has been an extremely effective President for the government he was given. If it weren't for the fact that he'd be 81 come inauguration day, I would have no issue saying run again where I'd donate and vote enthusiastically. But even there, I will donate and vote enthusiastically because fuck Trump, DeSantis, or whatever bozo the Republicans nominate.
Did the daughter even know about her absentee ballot? Maybe the Douche Pickle just put her down as absentee because he knew she would vote opposite of the R’s?
Why would he sign her up for absentee if he thought she would vote against him? Sounds like she lives and has residency in a different state, so he got her signed up thinking it would be a free vote for him. Then she voted against him, so he ratted her out for voting illegally.

Voter fraud is messing with your vote (e.g. voting more times than you're allowed to). Election fraud is messing with other people's votes.

Election fraud, on the other hand, racks up into the tens of thousands during every election. Especially voter suppression. Wish I could say it's always strictly a red state problem. But red states sure do more than their share of it.

They even checked around the country - nobody chartered that many busses anywhere. Often, conservative accusations don't even make sense.
I don't know why you guys can't accept basic facts. You are so intent on being the victim of something here and it's not the case. I don't know what to tell you - the rules are simple but keep stomping your foot I guess?

No, she has no way to know if it’s a transgender “woman” or some guy creeping in to see her naked. The frightening part is wondering if she’s being peeped on or worse.

You expect to see a cis woman in a woman’s locker room. Now you’re just being obtuse if you think that’s a valid argument for letting men into women’s locker rooms. Just because you have no problem getting nude in front of or being around nude people of the opposite sex doesn’t mean it’s the norm, nor should it be.

The fact that I have to try to convince someone that a naked man shouldn’t be strolling around in front of minor girls is just absurd.

How is a 17 year old supposed to be able to tell a naked transgender “woman” from a naked man? I’d say she has a pretty good right to be freaked out about that as she’s stepping out of the shower herself.
...a treaty they're already in violation of by not allowing US weapon inspectors in to inventory their nukes.
They're unlikely to give a shit about the treaty at this point. What's one violation on top of another?

Yes, even if we watched it happen on satellite and were standing next to the Ukrainians who did the drone strike, the treaty still indicates that they have to inform the US of the loss of hull.

I’m not hearing any verifications here in Ukraine, but the current missile/bombing attacks happening across the country right now sure seem retaliatory given these events being in the news this morning.

That ofcourse doesnt mean Ukraine shouldnt strike inside Russia, but i can at least understand why the US doesnt want its weapons invloded in strikes deep in russian territory.

The rule about not attacking russian territory is with the weapons they are being given from the west, not the weapons they have.

They have been sneaking helicopter attacks into russia every once in a while. They just dont publish it and the Russians downplay it, there was an amazing video of Hinds hitting a fuel depot early on.
In case you're not following, Israel's right wing parties' PR is dominantly focused on internal security, with 2nd place being playing on the feelings of the poor.
I think it would be hard to argue that foreign policy isn’t the wedge issue that keeps the Israeli right wing in power.

So it kinda weird how Israel like to project itself as fighting against Iran, yet they have done nothing to prove that, aside from empty threats.

Edit: And seeing how Israel for decades have been claiming Iran are 2-3 years away from nukes, and under last deal with Iran, it was shown they were no where near that.... It does cast huge shadow of a doubt on what Israel has been claiming.

But yeah lets take pride in a nation violating sovereignty of another, instead of Idk diplomacy? which has worked under Obama and showed Iran was willing to work with international communities in-regards to their program.
Zelenskyy at the G20 Summit: "One cannot trust Russia's words, there will be no Minsks-3, which Russia would violate immediately after signing. We will not allow Russia to start a new series of terror and global destabilization./We know by name 11 thousand children who were forcibly deported to Russia./Millions of hectares of forest were burned by shelling. Almost two hundred thousand hectares of our land have unexploded mines and shells./Peace is important for every person. I am confident that it is likewise for each of you, leaders of G-19. If Russia opposes our peace formula, you will see that it only wants war.".

Pro-Russian commander Aleksandr Khodakovsky reveals the planning for the attack on the ill-fated Pavlivka. According to him, the leadership ordered an attack despite a lack of manpower, focusing on a very narrow area and allowing Ukrainians to devastate the advancing forces.
Because the guy paying the FBI agent is a rival to Putin. The narrative that this is more Russian collusion falls apart a bit when Putin isn’t behind it, but instead a Russian with deep links to Christopher Steele and the “Russian dossier” against Trump.
That’s important context, because it points to potential further Russia backed interference on behalf of Trump rather than a “Guy leading the ‘witch hunt’ against Trump was the real Russian agent” talking point.

And Manafort's business partner, Konstantin Kliminik, a former Russian citizen, believed Russian agent, gave the Trump campaign polling info to Russia. And fled the US after the election, and is now wanted by the FBI and has a $250K bounty on his head for information leading to his capture.

And he took money from Oleg Deripaska, the same guy that put Manafort together with pro-russian former Ukrainian president Yanukovych. Manafort owed millions to Deripaska when he went to work running the Trump campaign - for free. First action, remove 'Protect the Ukraine from Russian aggression' from the Republican party platform.
You don’t think a photo op of Biden scurrying to safety would undermine the symbolism of him being there in the first place?
In my version, Biden is a normal politician who didn't do anything atrocious, just pulled a harmless PR stunt like all other politicians do...meanwhile, in your version, Biden is a reckless, moronic sociopath who put his vanity above all else, lol.

You generally don't hear a real air raid siren and say "okay, time to go outside for those photo ops now." That only makes sense if the alarm isn't actually warning you of any real danger.

No, I think there was no reason for him to scurry to safety because he and everyone else there knew the alarm was meaningless and there was no actual danger.

Meanwhile, you seem to think that the alarm was real, and POTUS actually was in danger, but chose to ignore it to get a photo op. Your version is insanely stupid, because besides being an incomprehensible breach of security protocol, it would also mean that he was fine with endangering the lives of everyone else, not to mention plunging the country and the whole damn world into complete chaos, all to snap a few photos.
They want Ukraine to shoot civilians after they get shot at by Russians dressed like civilians. Then they want to say “look at these monsters!”.
If their intent of wearing civilian clothes is to direct artillery or missile strikes or they have weapons and commit direct attacks while out of uniform, it’s a war crime.

The reason why I mention the execution part was hearing stories in WWII where soldiers would get caught wearing civilian clothing and pretty much shot on the spot. I'm sure it's much different now though.

Very much so, I'm sure some countries don't give a shit about the Geneva or Hugue though. I mean heck, look what they do to collaborators in Ukraine. They're pretty much hunted down and executed or car bombed. So in a way, I wouldn't be surprised if Russian soldiers were executed for wearing civilian clothing.

Chances are these guys are going to have guns and be shooting at advancing Ukrainian soldiers, so it's kind of moot.

On their 2015 federal return, Trump and his wife declared negative income of $31.7 million, with taxable income of $0. The couple paid federal income taxes of $641,931.
The 2018 return declared total income of $24.4 million, with taxable income of $22.9 million. The Trumps paid $999,466 in federal income taxes.

Let's say Trump pays $3 m in estimated tax payments for one tax year. This is the total tax that his CPA's are either estimating, or having him pay in to avoid taxes/penalties based off whatever estimate they are working with. Trump declares, for whatever reason, $0 of taxable income (Perhaps he got wiped out on a real estate sale, etc).

Quarterly payments would be included in a refund figure if he ended up with $0 in taxable income. I agree that $5 million in estimated payments is very high considering the prior year tax of $133k - definitely something else going on. Considering 2020 was the pandemic, there's likely some credits he took advantage of to get such a high refund.
The thing that scares me is that I believe there are enough low information swing voters out there who don’t understand how fascist and authoritarian Ron DeSantis is (more than Trump even), but who would likely vote for him over Biden based on age alone.
While it is entirely possible that a younger more exciting candidate may have a better chance to win than incumbent Biden, there are far from any guarantees that that will be the case, and I’d actually wager that it’s less likely than not.

Soon will come the rerun against Trump, likely without significant primary challenges to Biden, but again with the same strong likelihood that Biden is the only Democratic figure of any prominence that can beat him — yet away we'll go again with folks lamenting that we're stuck with this incredibly effective and dignified president with a strong likelihood of winning instead of... someone who can't win and probably wouldn't get anywhere near as much done even if they did, I guess?

It's because he isn't a majority if the party's first choice but he is _broadly acceptable_ to the most people. Those 60% of Democrats who want to see someone else as the nominee don't agree on _which_ someone else they want as the nominee and so Biden would end up as the guy again, if he runs.

In the last poll I seen 60 percent of democrats don't want biden to run again. 80 percent of young democrats don't want him to run. This is not how you excite your base to get out the vote.
Neville Chamberlain takes all the blame but people need to remember that the UK and France were democracies and that another war with Germany was wholly unpopular. Sure, we have the benefit of hindsight and knowing that France could have entirely destroyed the German state had they invaded while Germany was busy invading Poland... But the world doesn't work that way. A more aggressive posture from Chamberlain at the time likely would have just resulted in him being forced to resign.
As you rightfully point to the Treaty of Versailles as in many ways creating a scenario that would inevitably lead to a second war, have to understand that Russians feel the same way about the break up of the Soviet Union.

Now, compare the European territory lost in the to the European territory lost in the and you start to understand the Russian perspective. Territory that the entire world once understood to be Russian and allowed to remain so despite German conquest, less than 80 years later, a single lifetime, the world now acts like that territory should have never been Russian to begin with..

To be clear I'm not suggesting Russia should reconquer Soviet states, even if she were militarily capable of that. My point is only that a basis for an honest peace with Russia would be better if the West used Putins own logic against him rather than negotiate from a position of idealism.

Russia is not serious about peace negotiation. Putin must be dreaming that no matter how painful it is Russia will emerge as final victor except as time passes he will be strangulated financially, his military ruined, his country end up as pariah of the West.

While there might be a semblance of truth to Putins claim that the end of WW2/USSR left the world with historically anachronistic borders, it would be good to remind him that Russia benefited from that as well, namely Kaliningrad in Europe and the Kuril/Sakhalin island of Japan. The cession of those territories should be the first thing in any deal to recognize Crimea.
A video of Iranian fans unfurling a large Ukrainian flag in the stands during the game was posted online.

Keep the eye on the prize: this war is to kick Russia out of Ukraine. The Russians want to say it is a war to destroy Russia. It is not. It is a war to make Russia's invasion of Ukraine fail. That is why there is a war: because Russia invaded Ukraine. And that is what the object of the fighting is: to remove the invader from Ukraine.

Ukrainians protested domestic tyrants not for the E.U., sorry, and accession to the E.U. isn't a victory for ukrainians either. It's not even that important, it's more like people just don't mind getting into the E.U., they don't understand what it means well enough. And it definitely doens't balance out all the deaths and destruction. It's NATO that's important, because it could prevent that from happening in the future.

This seems to be a very important lesson for EU and Nato. Keeping critical information classified or obfuscated is a very important part of propaganda, but at the same time you must have the actual true information flowing between critical government and military entities in the alliance. This requires some common ways of working from all parties involved.
The headline now says 400k. That is great, but it's still only 10% of people who voted in the general election. This is record breaking numbers on a day to day basis only because Georgia's Republican state legislature shortened the runoff election to try to stop people from voting.
ATLANTA — In the first and only weekend of early voting in the Georgia Senate runoff, tens of thousands of voters cast ballots in the election pitting Democratic Sen. Raphael G. Warnock against Republican challenger Herschel Walker — the last Senate contest of the 2022 midterms.

Among those who voted on Saturday were Georgia residents who told The Washinon Post that busy schedules made voting impossible during the week. The lines also included college students home for the Thanksgiving holiday who preferred to vote in person rather than rely on an absentee ballot.

On Sunday, an additional 86,937 people voted. That number combined with voters in select counties who voted before Thanksgiving and the 15,305 mail ballots accepted so far means that a total of 181,711 voters had cast their ballots by the weekend.

On Saturday, 70,050 Georgians turned out to vote, utilizing an extra day of early voting resulting from a lawsuit filed by Warnock, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the state Democratic Party. Republicans tried to block the effort in court but were unsuccessful.
Lol this is a joke. This whole political landscape is a fucking joke. It took a former president, that no one likes, going there for these people to finally acknowledge this.
Great so multibillion dollar corporations will profit of the rebuilding. That’s still taxpayers money going to things that don’t help taxpayers. We ain’t flying Americans over to rebuild Ukraine.

The US isn’t giving Ukraine aid for free. The Lend-Lease Act was signed with Ukraine before giving them aid. The Lend-Lease is also required to be paid back, either through monetary means or the use of American contractors to help reconstruct a country, stimulating the loans back into the U.S. economy. It took Britain and Russia several decades to pay back their lease. Both repaid in full in 2006. At the end of a war, countries are required to make payments as a way of making up for the damage inflicted. This was the case at the end of both world wars.

We can only hold Russia accountable for now by levying sanctions against them and seizing Russian assets to help pay for it. We can hold Norfolk Southern directly responsible.
If you take what the article says she is saying at its word and assume it is meant in earnest - conditions in a DC jail and for being a traitor.
If you recognize the bullshit tactics and MO of people like Greene - because Pelosi is a Democrat and participated in holding the GQP and insurrectionists accountable.

The GQP has abandoned the concept of "reasonable" long ago. They don't feel the need to justify anything beyond "this will hurt people we don't like and energize the people who put us in power.".

Yeah. Not only do the remaining sane Republicans want a Speaker who isn't an idiot, but even some of those who might have supported him are not going to be happy that he's cutting so many deals with the crazy caucus that will hurt them in future elections.

There will probably be somebody who cuts a deal with those Republicans and Democrats to get their support as Speaker.

Yes, give Pelosi a great, big soapbox to stand on and a giant megaphone right in the face of the most craven Republicans. Great way for the Republicans to make even bigger fools of themselves than they already have.

Well it would make MTG look even more like a hypocrite than she already does - and that’s hard to do!

MTG would have to look into all of Congress’ insider trading. There’s nothing special about Pelosi. They all do it; they’re all allowed to do it. I think it’s wrong but, if you just investigate all of Congress, not just Pelosi, it’s purely political posturing that will bite you in the ass - hard.
The DNC is making this the first stop of the primaries because they now see it as a safe place to give corporate Dems an early boost. If they start in a place like California or NY then they run the real risk of progressives becoming front runners with an insurmountable lead.
Yeah, the media effectively declared a Biden win despite South Carolina not being reflective of the electorate.

It’s also way bigger - Biden got more votes in SC than Bernie did in the previous three states combined - but those states gave people a false sense of who could win.

Some might think this is a clue that Biden is running but honestly I think it's the opposite. It's a sign he might not run. If Biden runs, he'll do it unopposed and not have to worry about primaries at all. But if he doesn't run, there'll be a contentious primary, and SC favors Biden's more moderate side as it did in 2020. So someone like Harris or Buttigieg could run and do well early for instance.

The party can cancel primaries if they want to for him, as the GOP did for Trump. There's really no risk. Newsom and Sanders already said they're not running against him, and there's no other serious challenger. I guess it could be added protection, but I think it's more about if he doesn't run.
There is a segment of the population that is violent, psychopathic, habitual, and frankly unrepentant.
I'm about as liberal as they get. But there is a segment of the population that frankly needs to be incarcerated.

We should be working on comprehensive prison reform. This most certainly should include review of how to release many non-violent offenders/non habitual criminals, minor drug infractions etc.

It doesn't have to be an either/or situation. But eliminating or abolishing prisons is not a realistic or intellectually honest debate one can have.

Abolishing prisons means not only removing a place that protects society from many violent and deranged people, but would also get rid of of a primary disincentive to commit a crime in the first place.

I always felt that low level nonviolent offenders should be given the option of working off their sentence performing menial jobs that many non- criminals don’t want to do. They could add value to society rather than being a drain on the system with the cost of incarceration.
I don't understand why people think that using a fax machine is outdated. The number one country in fax machine sales is the U.S., and the number two is Japan, and the number three is Germany. I mean, the more developed countries tend to use fax machines.
The reason why fax machines became popular in Japan is because Japan has the most developed telephone network in the world. This is the reason why fax machines are only popular in developed countries because developing countries have imperfect telephone networks. There are data that show that fax machines are much safer than sending information over the Internet.

There is nothing inherently "secure" about fax machine or its data transmission. It's definitely less secure than the end to end encrypted data transmission over internet.
Everyone got something in the omnibus,that's why it got passed so overwhelmingly in the senate. If Bernie was the president, I would imagine his agendas would be too progressive and uncompromising to have success Biden has had. Plus, Biden and McConnell are friends and that helps.
Biden really was the right man for the job. Sure, he's old. And gaffe prone. But he knows how the system is supposed to work. Trump and his cronies smashed the system like a toddler smashes a Lego house. And there wasn't anyone more qualified then Biden to put it back together.

Despite the Republicans best efforts, the federal government is functioning again. Biden deserves far more credit than he'll ever get for pulling things back from the brink.

Biden was able to do more with less in 1 year than Trump was able to do in 4. I very much want to see Biden step down in 2024, but I think it is pretty irrefutable that Biden was the man for the job.

Biden is a president. Trump is a wannabe mafioso grifter. One has qualities that can be discoursed, but generally agreed upon. The other belongs has no redeeming qualities.
It's a well thought out and explained thread for sure. My honest opinion is the rumblings of an attack from Belarus are a distraction or an attempt to divert Ukrainian focus away from the front but more specifically the Russian's are sabre rattling because they're beginning to fear losing Crimea.
Ultimately even if Putin tries attacking from the North through Belarus it doesn't seem very viable, their forces and supplies are lacking, the defenders are far more prepared, they risk a repeat of "CONVOOOOOOOOOY" and we know how much of a shitshow that turned out for them as well as the only roads being narrow and easy to snipe them from.

also, Putin is supposedly in Belarus so nothing will underline RU their failure to Luca's army as Russia wasted so many people only to lose all their gains at the will of UA in a few minute's time.

Lukashenko is also perilously close to losing power too, he's only somewhat secured right now only because of Putin but if he sends his own military in he loses his only insurance against being Mussolini'd. If Putin tries to remove him it's likely to backfire too. The chance of Belarus attacking remains low and unlikely simply because they not only lack enough forces but they would be seen coming.

presumably Putin almost had to do this now lest Russia come out of the war so weakened that they can't merge Belarus later. Whether they can even pull it off now though seems a really big question.
A Gender Critical activist in the UK gave a public speech a few days ago and she quoted Adolf Hitler, basically called trans people a Big Lie that were created in the early 20th century.That we aren’t real and society has been fooled into believing we are. Another had been caught publicly talking about ways they can reduce numbers of trans people.
“They seem like they’re about protecting kids from harm, but really it’s a ploy to erase LGBTQ people from public life,” Schneider said. “It’s a scare tactic that we see all the time, but even scare tactics have a real impact on our community.”.

Andrew Schneider, the executive director of Fairness West Virginia, a statewide LGBTQ rights group, compared the bills to Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law (dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics), which prohibits classroom instruction on “sexual orientation or gender identity … in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”.

People who violate the bill regulating venues and performances, SB 278, could face a misdemeanor, a fine of up to $1,000 and/or jail time. Venues that allow minors to be present for performances that the bill defines as obscene or sexually explicit could face a public nuisance complaint.

I take it most of the commenters did not read the article it talks about exposing minors to explicit content not just for exposing someone to trans people.

That is to say, the bill specifically defines "transgender exposure [...] to a minor" as inherently indecent and sexually explicit. So yes, it does make exposing someone to trans people illegal.
That’s how I know people are brain dead from throating Fox News, thinking that by giving Ukraine money and weapons, they themselves are somehow personally affected and are against sending aid.
Don’t know who ‘we’ is in this case but sending billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Ukraine to beat back the Russians seems like a great option and is indeed being done.

Oh, oh, I know, we could go in and make the Russians stop and leave Ukrainian soil, and get everyone involved in war crimes to a tribunal. And we should help the Ukrainians to use force if the Russians won't do any of that willingly and they're fighting back.

Russia won't admit defeat and even if they get kicked out of Ukraine, Putin will find a silly way to spin the result as a victory of some sort.

But no one cares what Russia thinks or says, as long as we arm Ukraine to let them inflict as much damage on Russia as possible, and then follow that up by harder sanctions and complete isolation, the result will almost inevitably be the collapse of the Russian federation.

I do feel bad for any Russian civilians who are against the war and against Putin's regime, I really do and unlike many others in the west I am sure that they do exist, but there's no other way. Forcing Russia as a country into depression and preferably decades of internal fighting and instability is needed to send a message that this sort of behavior won't work and will backfire.

And before some idiot starts comparing this to Germany after WWI, this is more like Nazi Germany after WW2.. and I believe Germany paid handsomely for the war, they were broken into smaller states for decades and subject to foreign rule not to mention that the dickhead who started it was forced to shoot himself and his cronies were put on trial and many of them executed. If anything we're letting Russia walk away with light damage.
Precisely. To make matters worse Russia also doesn’t waste med evac resources on them so if a prison recruit is injured they’re often left to die unless they can get themselves out.
That doesn’t surprise me too much. From my understanding Russia still does med evac for their regular soldiers but things are rarely consistent so across all units so a random officer saying “don’t bring back wounded” is pretty believable.

I have a sneaking suspicion that it's absurdly hard to get soldiers to earnestly run into battle if they keep seeing their friends left injured on the field. In reality if you could get young men to run toward gunfire completely without fear, and at a much cheaper cost/battle, even modern militaries would completely forgo the no man left behind mentality. But if they actually scrapped no man left behind, there would literally be no men around, to leave behind.

As it stands, no man actually wants to be left behind and if you have a better chance at survival by dropping your weapons and walking away, most would.
The innocent blood of children is being shed in the hands of the Saudi regime, as the number of executions of minors has seen a slight increase in the past six years. The thought of children being subjected to the horrors of torture and denied a fair trial before facing the death penalty is beyond unacceptable and reprehensible.
They execute protestors and minors under torture who never hurt or killed anyone without fair or public trails. They also execute activists and whistle blowers, and people who voice their disagreements. They even killed and handed death sentences for people who refused to leave their homes for Neom project.

I don't get how you compare US death penalty of ruthless murders after appeals and public trails to that shithole. Also if you compare them by % of population , it's 20 times that of the US. It's just another level.

I was advocating to stop western and US support to these dictatorships and get their hands completely out of the region. First of all, sanctioning SA regime wouldn't turn them into Iran 2.0 , they don't have quarter of half of the balls of Iran. They literally lost an 8-yr war against a minority militia in part of Yemen who were supported by Iran. Iran has been able to survive US and western sanctions, built its own military, develop nuclear weapon, and have relationships with other axis of (evil) powers in the world like China and Russia. Without US and Israel , this regime will not survive a week. Second of all, let's say they turned into Iran 2.0. Well Iran and SA are very alike. They're both different faces to the same currency; both are barbaric inhumane dictatorships. Why would you be mad if they fought? Who are you cheering for? No one but evil is fighting for these governments that oppress, loot and don't represent their people. A civil unrest is indeed probable between citizens and the renaming cartel members of the regime, but again how loyal are those people when we've seen them switch sides as soon as the payments stop. For that, yes there's no other way how the region will have to decide to rule themselves afterward. It's possible they end up with another dictator but it would still be better without influence from the west empowering and choosing dictators for them. Why is that? I'll say in 2.
Well, your party fared better with one of its idiots…Republicans pick em’ but can’t elect em’ Dems found Fetterman or woman, and he won Another basement candidate, just like Biden…Republicans need a good dose of campaigning 101.

It's not just that he's a uniquely bad candidate- who still got 48% of the vote- it's that he's running against a uniquely elegant Democrat, a guy with a PhD who turned his thesis into a well-respected book on black theology and the history of the black church. Warnock is morally and literally the heir of Martin Luther King- occupying his pulpit- and while he's got some warts, running Walker against him proves that the GOP really does think black people are stupid. Do they really think that Walker would peel off black votes from Warnock, a legendary black activist and intellectual giant?

In practice, when that football player has significant mental health concerns, a violent and otherwise questionable history of poor moral character, and is essentially incapable of expressing a rational thought...the worst case scenario for Republicans was is that he still somehow had an incredibly close race, despite a notable number of Republican voters splitting their ticket pro-Kemp and no-vote or Warnock Senate.

In theory, the basic idea had merit. Run a black football star in Georgia - attempt to appeal to the people who can't see past "football celebrity" and undercut Warnock's racial identity as a factor.
Where in the name of all of fuck do the Chinese get the unmitigated gall to protest a damn thing here? And where the hell are any Western leaders standing up to call them out on their bullshit? I swear, their post shoot-down whining pisses me off five times more than sending the thing to start with. Not to mention our pathetically craven response from day one.
I think these Chinese balloon and protests are literally... literally... tests to see just how much contempt they can pour onto perceived adversaries before they summon at least some tiny, scraggly, droopy little balls to actually push back.

Many UFO sightings have been proven to be weather or even party balloons. When you’re in a plane moving quickly or when clouds are moving quickly balloons can appear to be moving quickly or in weird ways.

Imagine seeing this in contrast to fast moving low flying clouds and not understanding it’s 8 mile above them. You could easily mistake it’s speed to be insane.

You act as if the people actually doing the damn lying are somehow innocent in all this. Yes, better opposition research should have been done...but YES, they absolutely hold some culpability in their selected candidate, that they are both running and funding, lying about almost everything in his life. If a Dem was caught doing this, you bet your ass they would definitely get some of the blame...to only put this on the opposite party is extremely short sighted and hypocritical as shit.

If every GOP candidate/politician has something obviously shitty about them, that will inevitably get reported on. If the media is calling out/“attacking” a disproportionate amount of GOP candidates, it starts to look like political prosecution rather than honest reporting. If it looks like political prosecution to the voters, they can convince themselves the accusations are untrue they remain steadfast in their convictions and keep voting R with a clear conscience.
Bout is infamous for doing the latter. What makes him special is that he's a smuggler. Practically anybody can be a middleman and buy weapons on behalf of their country. But he was special because he could sell Soviet weapons to places that have arms embargos by hiding the arms alongside his legitimate legal cargo.
That's a good point, I hadn't even considered that yet. Russia is well-known for using social media as a weapon, so this was likely all planned from the start.

IMO there's a very small chance that he goes back into arms smuggling. Russia is likely not interested in selling its remaining weapons, and they don't really need any help getting their weapons transported to the theater of war, since it's right at their doorstep.

He could theoretically serve as a middleman for Russia to purchase weapons illegally or to supply them to groups that support Russia’s interests in Europe or the rest of the world. I’m guessing the US government is banking on him not being able to do that effectively anymore, which seems likely to be the case, but who knows. I think it’s more likely this is just some sort of a PR play by Russia because the headline makes the US look bad.
Basic summary: if this account is accurate, locals are furious about the Turkish government response. In particular, the Turkish government apparently plans to quickly bury victims in mass graves, something the locals see as an insulting attempt to sweep the disaster under the carpet. Some locals, allegedly, planned to put pressure on the Turkish government to stop their plan, by kidnapping international rescue teams, because this would gain international attention. For this reason, several international teams (not just Israelis) are pulling out.
Allegedly, the Israelis are the third national team to cease operations because of the security situation.

Having international teams pull out because the government can’t guarantee their security is a huge embarrassment for the Turkish government, and possibly a bad sign of serious trouble ahead. From what I have read online (which may admittedly not be a representative sampling), ordinary Turkish citizens are furious with their government, as both the preparations and response to this terrible disaster have been judged by them to be completely inadequate.

To my mind, the bigger story is this: it shows just how angry some Turks have become over their own government’s handling of the situation, and how much the Turkish government is losing control over these affected areas.

I mean just the feed for animals measured in land is 80% of agriculture. Thats the barley, oats, soy and hay and other grains used in animal feed (for farm animals, so not including cat and dog feed which is mostly meat from those industries).
We fed the animals with barley, oats and hay only in the winter on my grandfather's farm, as grasses we ground them with corn to make nutritious fodder for the cold days. In industrial farms, it is only with mixtures of corn and soy, and as far as I understand animal and fish scraps processed as protein powder, for faster mass gain. I mean agriculture and animal husbandry can be sustainable. But the biggest polluters are industrial farms with the entire production and feeding chain. If they stop, will farmer John with 100 sheep and a few cows selling his produce to the local restaurant be a big polluter.

But this 80% must also include the mega industrial farms that probably also hold the fields where the crops are grown for animal feed. Probably cheap and at the expense of some ecosystem.

Experts say yesterday’s verdict is a sign that more serious criminal charges could be on the way for Trump. Trump’s company, the source of his ego-boosting fortune, was found guilty on Tuesday afternoon of all 17 counts in a corporate tax fraud case.

The verdict could signal the start of a new season of legal accountability for Trump, since it shows that a jury can be convinced to reach a guilty verdict—17 times in this case—in a matter directly touching Trump.

The other premise in the article was that this guilty verdict for the Trump Organization would lead to criminal prosecution of Trump himself. It's part of a rebranding. Trump is now looking like a loser. Future indictments will not look like partisan political attacks. MAGA loyalists will complain. But most Americans will think that Trump deserves what he gets.
With the population density being so high on top of the other two factors, there is a very high probability there will be even more variants and a complete collapse for a multitude of different parts of the economy including healthcare, education, tourism, manufactorong and so on.
Their vaccine isnt as strong as a lot of the ones from the west and because they were forcing mass populations to shut down the passed three years when they spotted a single case they never had chance of gaining a herd immunity.

What China did was lock down, but due to their closed government - refused to use any western developed vaccines which were seemingly much more effective than the indigenous Chinese vaccines.

Basically - most other countries locked down, until vaccines became available as it was necessary to do so. Then they slowly started to reopen, bit by bit. This meant their populations were highly vaccinated, and herd immunity in the public was strong from infections.

The prolonged lockdown meant that on top of having a weaker vaccine, there was a lack of herd immunity. Instead of gradually opening things up bit by bit like the west, China just completely abandoned their lockdown and are now suffering for it.
I recall reading about a case of transmission of CJD from a cornea transplant, from one human to another. I am not an expert on this disease, but considering its severity, i would err on the side of caution and not take chances with blood donation.
We have to keep in mind that people receiving the blood are not healthy to begin with so anything that gets transmitted could very likely be lethal.

I think this whole discussion about not excluding gay people from donating is a result of better tests which can detect earlier, better medication which lessens the consequences of catching HIV and a general decline in HIV cases in the population and gay men.

I don't think it was discriminating to generally exclude higher risk groups from donating. Speaking from experience you get denied from donating for a lot of things even if there is only a very small risk of transmitting anything.

It does, afaik it even gets tested multiple times but the tests can't detect HIV in the first few days/weeks after infection.

Worst case scenario, the test fails to catch it and someone receives HIV tainted blood. All tests fail. Current estimates are about 1 in a million blood transfusions in the US are with HIV tainted blood. Which might not sound like a lot but given how many blood transfusions happen each year, it’s definitely still causing tragedies.

blood tests are done in batches and in some cases not done at all ( at least where I am), there was a huge issue in the 90s with people getting hep from blood transfusions. so, if you allow a high risk demographic to donate ((gay males being the highest), you will have to waste large amounts of donated blood.
My conservative family members are already telling me how “Biden’s doc situation is way worse than Trump’s!” I think the false equivalency machine is working as intended so far on the right.
This feels disingenuous, CNN was saying trump stole nuclear secrets and committed treason, none of which were true, Republicans making fun of biden for doing the exact same thing seems pretty justified.

Actually since Trump has such a powerful mind he accidentally declassified the Biden documents when he was thinking about all the documents he needed to psychically declassify. . He had intended to only include the Mar-a-Lago documents but instead used the overly broad "all documents stored in unapproved locations tag".

Trump is the one who notified the press about the search of his Mar-a-Lago residence. If he hadn't gone public and cooperated (even at that point) the whole documents scandal might have gone unnoticed. There is a good chance that the Biden team did a pre-emptive sweep for any documents to head off GOP investigations. Unfortunately they did discover some classified documents. Assuming the possession was inadvertent, at a minimum it indicates better procedures need to be put in place for outgoing politicians and "their" property.

Legally the Biden documents should have no relevance to the Trump case. Politically the Trump supporters lack the cognitive ability to distinguish between the two cases.
At 10:23pm, a journalist warned that two drones were flying towards Uman. According to him, drones can fly in the direction of the Kyiv region.

The US/NATO seem to be loading Ukraine up with weapons for something. We aren't giving them 50,000 grads or JDAMS for no particular reason. Either someone thinks they need them for defense against a Russian offense or there is a big Ukrainian offense coming up.

Both Ukraine and Russia are definitely going to start enormous maneuvers and offensives in the Spring. It's going to be interesting to see how much this winter "lull" will pay off in terms of Ukraine getting lots more guys trained on all the Western weaponry We're feeding them. Fingers crossed that Russia will not have spent this time actually giving its conscripts proper training.
You're right but you want that decline to be _gradual_ and to actually stop at some point. Neither of those things seem like they are going to be true for the places starting to see population crash on the horizon. You'd think they'd allow immigration to alleviate the problem but many of the places facing the worst crashes are also super anti-immigration so good luck with all that to those countries.
You'd think so but the data tells us that the higher the standard of living in a country the fewer children people have. This is consistent across the planet, every culture. People say "folks aren't having kids because they can't afford it" but that really doesn't seem to be how it works. Higher standard of living = fewer kids.

I know people in their late 30s who waited to have kids until they got better jobs or were able to buy a house. Sure, some people just have kids they can't really afford, but some others who would otherwise have them won't or won't have as many.

Yup, but don't say that while you're making enough money to afford it but don't want to sacrifice luxury or lifestyle that is unsustainable with children 👍.

Just because some people make poor financial decisions (choosing to have a child without being financially stable or able to afford it) doesn't mean everyone has to.

You seem to be implying that there is an obligation to have children and people who are determining that their finances don't allow for it are somehow shirking responsibility. That isn't the case and isn't how raising children should be viewed.
Baldwin has won fairly comfortably in her re-election bids but I don't think she's yet said if she'll run for another term. Tester OTOH is in real trouble as MT has lurched far to the right and AZ looks dicey if Sinema runs as an independent (even if she does poorly the elections in that state are so close it won't take much for it to flip to R.) Even if Dems somehow maintain their razor thin majority SCOTUS reform still won't happen. (If they lose control and a SCOTUS seat somehow opens then Democrats won't even be able to fill it if R's hold a majority.).
Good. Don't punish people who are merely accused of crime. If you want to take guns away from domestic abusers then take the time to prove them guilty in a court of law.

This ruling does not cover convicted abusers. It’s almost as if the standard necessary to procure a restraining order is insufficient to strip a citizen of their inherent rights, and a surprising number of people are offended by this concept.

My mother figure is in Russia. She hates the war herself, but between her mother who she has to support, her lack of personal income (is a digital artist but has to play cat and mouse to get commissions... She changed payment methods 4 times this year I think.), and her husband's inability to consume non-russian news because he cannot speak any language but Russian, she cannot get out on her own. Plus at this point, much of Russias exits have been cut off one way or another.
The normal Russian who had any savings already took them and left for anywhere but Russia. And spending them in other countries, helping their economies with what little they can.

It could work in theory, when nobody votes. Problem is, there’s more people who do vote in America, afaik, and back in Russia even if you voted they’d just falsify the results.

I know. It took a major amount of luck for me to leave and I may very well have to come back, considering how hard it is to get a job. I knew it would be tough but the prospect of having to admit failure is looking on the horizon.
The opioid "epidemic" began with people being able to get FDA approved prescription drugs in excess either from their doctors or from dealers.
It's no coincidence that the availability of prescription drugs went down just as fentanyl demand increased.

The fault here lies with the crackdown on prescription opioids without addressing the reason for the demand they only created a demand for fentanyl, a much more inconsistent and dangerous drug.

Fentanyl overdoses happen because in the black market, there is no quality control or consistency, allowing for the adulteration of fentanyl into the opioid supply in the first place.

Demand without means to get actual prescription drugs creates and reinforces the black market for opioids. It is nearly impossible to get prescription opioids now and in a lot of cases the doctors don't have the permission to prescribe it to you even if they think you need it. If you know what a real pain killer feels like and you know no amount of Tylenol, Aleve, or ibuprofen is going to help you then you will search elsewhere.
Yeah. That's why I'm a firm believer in Socio-capitalism. As in- when society is functioning normally, don't touch anything, but when poor disadvantaged people are being preyed on, getting hurt, we have to step in and help them.
We tried laissez-faire capitalism (no regulation) and look what happened, economic monopolies lack of innovation, and abusive worker conditions.

Unions may not be perfect, but they should be made available countrywide for both contractors and regular workers. Sometimes, managers want to do the right thing but are pressured by higher ups not to. So having a federally enforced union will give good managers a valid reason to refuse unscrupulous demands from higher ups such as for example: "fire people without notice.".

Iran has stationed Revolutionary Guard units within Ukraine to directly operate the drones to attack Ukraine. You can't get a whole lot more directly involved than that.

I mean I get that you're not defending their argument. I'm just saying... it's not even a technicality. It's like saying, "Technically, Ronald Reagan is not dead." No, he's dead. There's no technicality there. You know?
It’s about damn time the Democrats start playing hardball with these nut jobs. I really really hope they stick to their guns about this, and if the Republicans fail to raise the ceiling and people start to lose government benefits they hit the Republicans hard and blame them for a problem of their own creation. If they were actually consistent and gave a damn about the government debt anytime a Republican is the President maybe we could debate here.
That was the thinking every time Republican's held the budget hostage to the debt ceiling and every time they payed dearly for it. The only reason I'm hoping they don't do it is that it would inflict significant hardship on vulnerable Americans but if they want to touch the hot stove again...

Sure, the MAGA crowd are completely disconnected from reality and will believe whatever they're told but the rest of the electorate will know exactly who is causing the problem.

Both GDP and employment are up. Gas prices are down. My stock portfolio is up about 5% year over year. What is this "not recovering" you're talking about?
Republicans are slimey and will try to pass some variation of a law that doesn't explicitly say "you must be 21 to vote", but will try to put in some kind of rule or something that seriously restricts anyone under 21 from voting.
It’s amazing the efforts these pieces of crap will go through to restrict people from voting instead of creating any legislation that would make people want to vote for them.

There would be no way to write a law that would be able to frustrate voting because someone is 18. It would either be overly broad, or vague, both of which fail. While I am a newly minted lawyer, I assure you it is impossible to skirt around this particular amendment. It would be the same as trying to get around the amendment that allows for a direct vote of senators. How would you even do that?

But, at the same time, most big countries really have gone through some awful stage where they didn't look so great. Maybe Russia will come out of this and feel awkward for a few years, then gradually turn into a saner country.

If "being themselves" means infiltrating and conquering neighbors, that isn't a good trait to cling to. My constructive way to "escape punishment" would be to just...not be aggressive shitheels. It really isn't all that difficult to just not invade your neighbors. Most of humanity manages it these days.

Being done with them does not simply imply destruction. The vast majority of people want nothing to do with Russian antics, and would be over the moon to never have to deal with them again. Putin isn't the source of the "move Russians into a region, have them claim abuse, Russian military invades to support them" bit; it's just a Russian cultural staple no matter their government style.

I was telling my Thai wife how the lunch staff will throw away kids food in front of them if their parents have not paid the tab. She was dumbfounded. Every kid in Thailand gets a pretty nice free lunch.
It's criminal that we haven't addressed this in this country. Maybe it is because we've had programs in the past but I'm sure there are more kids that have food insecurity these days then 20 or 30 years ago.

And something I figured out on here is that if some kids are getting free lunches and other kids aren't, there will be bullying about this. Jesus fuck this is such a no-brainer. This is the kind of bread and butter shit the Democrats should be running on.

The are plenty of permits where no drilling is going on. And refining capacity is lower than pre-pandemic levels so even if there were more oil from more drilling, this industry-created bottleneck remains.
I believe a lot of this is because oil companies are refusing to reinvest into drilling and other production expanding activities. So like many other companies with a whole lot of cash flow (Apple) and nothing to buy they’re buying back shares. In part because of an adversarial environment for permitting and bleak long term outlook partially due to the Biden administration. So it’s a bit hypocritical for this administration to point and yell about share buybacks and artificial supply constraints when they’re doing everything to stop drilling. In the long term I believe it will probably be best to incentivize alternative forms of energy generation by making stringent and costly hurdles for oil extraction. But to pretend like this isn’t a side effect of those policies is a bit disingenuous.
> The main legal department of Ukraine’s Parliament also noted in an analysis published this month that it had been given little time to review changes in the bill and that the legislation’s language gave insufficient consideration to the risk of introducing censorship.
The headline tells the passing reader that Ukraine is cracking down on free speech (typically seen as a negative among the general population), when in reality they’re passing legislation to allow them to join the EU in the future.

While I agree the flow of information may need to be controlled during the war, the big concern I have is this will be in effect after the war, giving Ukraine the ability to suppress free speech whenever the government wants.

The only problem is this law can be used beyond the war, and should have been specified to end at the conclusion of the war to ensure it wasn’t there beyond that point. So even when the war ends, Ukraine, a country not exactly with a great track record for corruption, can use this to suppress free speech.

President Joe Biden is likely to announce his bid for reelection "not long after" he delivers his State of the Union address on Feb. 7, a source with knowledge of the ongoing planning confirmed to CBS News.

Basically if Biden runs, he will almost certainly win and if he doesn't, Democrats will almost certainly lose.

Biden is at the center of the Democratic party, politically, and is not personally divisive with his rhetoric. He's about as palatable as they come.

Republican voters actively despise Democrats based on nothing and would likely put forward a conspiracy theorist election denier as their candidate, so there's very little Democrats can do to bridge that gap.

I had a similar perspective before Biden started his term, but he's actually been doing a great job so far. I get that it's popular to hate on the old guys for being too decrepit to function, but it seems pretty clear to me he's up for it and doing what he should be.
People who slowly waste after 1+ year usually end up with a walker/ wheelchair towards the end. For me to believe that A) he has a terminal condition (which does seem plausible with how he looks) and that B) his prognosis is 'eminently fatal' I need Putin to be in a wheelchair or walking with assistance or completely out of public eye without a confirmed recent/ live appearance. Like Putin seen traveling on plane, walked off the plane and outside media saw this. Not a televised live, indoor interview. That can be pre-recorded. I mean like out and about. Mentions something specific in the last say or two. The bombing of 68, I mean 97, I mean 154 Russian troops.
Unless they are clearly avoiding having Putin appear or he's in a wheelchair he might be actively dying, but he's not on death's doorstep.

I put a curse on Putin before Christmas in 2021, that his health would fade and he would quickly succumb to a fatal illness.

Im ok with Democrats reaching out to some moderate Republicans to gain their votes via favors and concessions to get a democrat to the speaker position.
So... not saying that the House Republicans are alpha strategists, but what if they are willing to let Jeffries be the Speaker just so that the GOP, who are still in the majority, can clog everything up and blame the Democrats for all of the stalemates?

If you can't rally your members to vote for you to take the speaker of the house, then you are going have a hard time negotiating with your members and the democrats.

So, to the holdouts case, they can either have no power under the GOP, or no power under a Dem leader who will not have a majority to pass anything and they can deflect onto him being unable to get things done.

If they end up giving Jeffries the gavel, he'll have it worse than McCarthy; They don't have to vote with him just because they caused him to be Speaker.

Most voters don't give a shit about platforms. They care about who reminds them of their own father that they're missing. The stern angry father.
I will give you some specific examples. Very few people want social security or Medicare to be cut. The problem is the perception by most trump voters is that most people on welfare are urban poor when In fact a lot of them are rural poor.

The Republican party is doubling down on its old failed policies that even most Republican voters did not like. They are not learning that they need to focus on identity with the exception of DeSantis who is focused on such a narrow myopic topic. Well, two of them. One of them covid is now irrelevant. Nobody cares what he did 2 years ago because it's over. We all have natural immunity.

Well they agree with Trump and not the rest of the party. It is much more an indictment of the rest of the party for being out of sync with their voters.

The QAnon Anonymous podcast did a great two-parter on Tulsi just recently that I recommend. The cult her family belongs to also has strong ties to a fascist Indian organization. Her and her sisters are wolves in sheep's clothing, at best.

"."Sure—provided somebody tells him when he's young enough that there is a Money River, that there's nothing fair about it, that he had damn well better forget about hard work and the merit system and honesty and all that crap, and get to where the river is. 'Go where the rich and powerful are,' I'd tell him, 'and learn their ways. They can be flattered and they can be scared. Please them enormously or scare them enormously, and one moonless night they will put their fingers to their lips, warning you not to make a sound. And they will lead you through the dark to the widest, deepest river of wealth ever known to man. You'll be shown your place on the riverbank, and handed a bucket all your own. Slurp as much as you want, but try to keep the racket of your slurping down. A poor man might hear.' - Kurt Vonnegut.
He allowed leaked cables to go through, un redacted, that put operatives at risk and/or got them killed. There's still a limit to "just reporting." There is still responsibility.
There were some leaks that absolutely should have been shared with US citizens on some level. The friendly fire incidents the military tried to sweep under the rug...including deliberate murders of Iraqi civilians. We pay for this military, we vote for those who approve its budget, we absolutely deserve to be informed on mistakes, crimes, and failures.

Between that and his contradictory behavior when it came to US adversaries, he was not acting as a neutral provider of transparency, but rather an enemy of the state.

No, what he did was to release information that was damaging to the USA in an effort to hurt that country, not to expose questionable activities. It didn't matter who's lives were endangered, he released stuff guided by hate of one country.

And they just decided to do that once America signalled that they wanted to buy Venezuelan oil again and was willing to sit down and talk to Maduro which is pretty awkward if the US didn't recognize his government...
Yes, I agree it was rather shameful, however let's not pretend like the US was solely propping him up- there was a lot of legitimate support within Venezuela as Maduro was becoming more and more of a dictator and abusing power, increasing corruption, etc.

Oh well, a foreign government doesn't recognise a democratically elected President, gosh, I guess the people of Venezuela should run to the polls and elect someone the Americans do approve of, regardless of what they actually want.

The fact is it was a defensive missile. This is a perfect example of how collateral damage from wars spills over into neighboring countries.
Even if it was a Ukrainian missile that went stray while trying to intercept a Russian attack, the blame is still on Russia. Ukraine didn't kill those two innocent Poles, Russia did.

However, what concerns me is the disinformation coming out of the Ukrainian government. It's absolutely reckless and callous. They completely misled Poland and the rest of the world. Poland later found out and so instead of blaming Russia they covered their tracks by saying the missiles were Russian "produced". Meanwhile Estonia and Lithuania were practically getting ready to call for arms.
Sure, and I understand that point - their claim was that China is better at wielding soft power than the US, which is what I was curious about how they came to that conclusion.
Beyond that, the US never has been very good at wielding soft power as compared to the Chinese for example. The US approach has always been a much more direct stick and carrot approach, and honestly you can't tell me that the average American has a single clue as to the cultural intricacies of pretty much any other country in the world you care to name.

Yes, I suppose, but it's still more true than not, and the main reason why I like pushing this button is because a lot of this is pretty much utterly ignored in US education or the US media for the most part.
Maybe a better option would be to use western intelligence capabilities to sneak a few thousand automatic rifles through the border into Iran so that protesters would have something to push back government forces, instead of stating the obvious by lighting up a useless tower on another continent?
Maybe even shoot a long range missile into Ayotallah's mansion while that shithead is snoring, because they don’t have a nuclear weapon to retaliate, for now, and do the same with other high profile figures of the regime, it’s not like the most of their civilians aren’t supporting a regime change.

Yes let’s risk another international conflict, because it’d be so easy to sneak weapons across the Iranian-controlled Iranian border just like that to arm untrained civilians and make sure they don’t provoke the government either further and have them actually mowed down en-masse now.

Giving the Iranian protesters guns is basically impossible since no one knows who the hell the protesters are and there's no organization to give guns to, while Ukraine has a whole state structure to recieve Western weapons and train their battle-harden troops to use the weapons.

More fundementally, Ukraine is a nation-state with soliders, the Iranian protesters aren't even a solid group or organization but rather large unorganized public reactions to police burtality and sexism from the Islamic Regime.

This is a dumb argument. That’s like saying that the human body is ugly because we wear clothes that accentuate our best features. All kinds of food are tasty. That includes vegan foods and animal products, some of which are among the best foods I’ve ever tasted, but have you never tried a good ribeye?
Very true. We’re past the point of undoing the damage and are rapidly approaching the point of mitigating the consequences of our damage. Now we have the choice to stop making it worse or lean in on destroying the planet for profits.

I agree that dropping the worst foods is a win both for health and the planet. I prefer to live in a world with billions of people that are 'as vegan aas possible' rather than one with millions of actual vegans.

Let's utilize a natural resource responsibly and as ethically as we can and not pretend that vegan is even close accessible for billions of humans. Nor pretend that vegan industry is currently anymore green or less harmful than meat.

Thankfully, after Ukraine successfully defending Odesa and securing Kherson, the biggest threat Moldova faces now are blackouts instead of direct assault.
I think the only people who genuinely would (instead of saying it because they're told to) are people who don't know about Moldova. Everything Russia has said about Ukraine to justify its invasion applies just as much to Moldova, but the difference is that Moldova doesn't have the means to defend itself.

With Russian military support not being the Trump card it once was and sympathy for Russian minorities trying to form breakaway republics at an all time low, there is indeed a path to catastrophe there.

The people in Transnistia do have their own identity, culture and ethnic background but few people will be sympathetic to their ideas of self-determination in a region where Russia just used that excuse to start an invasion.
Russia likes to whine about "NATO expansion" but all that really means is countries around Russia want to join NATO for protection from Russia, and Russia tries to portray that as NATO invading and taking over these countries.
And? in 2010, and public support for joining NATO remained abysmally low until after Russia annexed Crimea until after which it surged and then.

It was the same with Ukraine before Russia annexed Crimea, after that happened there was overwhelming support for joining NATO.

Not sure what part of this is so complicated for people to grasp - Russia's annexation of Crimea made Ukraine want to join NATO again, and dramatically increased public support for NATO in Ukraine.

LOL nice way to handwave away the fact that Ukraine re-started the process to join Nato after Russia attacked - and the claim he couldn't have been elected if Ukraine started to join NATO in 2008 is just straight up nonsense.

I mean, we should be stupid to not use next Russia's downfall to make it a last Russia's downfall. Why be Peterborough, Region of Russia when you can be Peterborough, an independent country?
Yeah, ofc I meant Petersburg. I said Petersburg because it is very left aligned. Peak designers, peak IT, most LGBT supportive, more progressive community overall. Idk about outcome, but actually developed region with west-align would barely want to continue exist as a part of a broken beyond repair Russia.

Although, this talk is likely pointless, i don’t personally see this happening at all, unless perhaps Ukraine for some reason decides to push into Russian territory, which certainly would be a pivotal point for the world.

Probably it's possible to extrapolate to some extent what is happening in Ukraine to Baltic states (with obviously sad results for them if they will be "on their own"). But it's hard for me even to realize how people imagine the conflict between Russia and Japan.
Something I do find myself wondering though is why, if US intelligence has been aware of the passing of these balloons on a more or less routine basis, they decided to make a public spectacle of this one at this time?
But NORAD is saying that although they can go back and look at the data now to determine that 3 balloons passed during the Trump administration, there was no awareness of the craft at the time.

Possible. The Guardian article at the top of the subreddit right now says the pentagon was aware of 3 during the Trump administration, and a 4th one early in the Biden administration. This is at least the 5th detected balloon.

A balloon isn't that easy to detect. The radar return won't be all that strong and a slow target might be missed if Moving Target Indication (MTI) processing is used to avoid detecting birds or ground clutter. There is also the problem of distinguishing a threat from legitimate weather balloons.

People envision these balloons like they're a helium party balloon, but they're really not. They're pretty loosely inflated, just buoyant enough to stay afloat. Punching tiny holes, like a bullet, doesn't make them pop.
People have lost their minds. Just saw a Facebook post about that podcast Ye walked out of, and so many black people still say they support ye. Even asking me how is Nick Fuentes a white supremist? I shared two videos, which anyone with working brain cells can see he is. Make it make sense, cause if someone said they hate Jews, as a Jewish person, I would not be all, well let's hear him out.
The only thing a christian nationalist anti-semite hates more than Jews is Muslims. They'd rather have Jews in charge there versus palestinians.

Also as stated below if you look into Christian eschatology it is true that this is believed. Hell it’s in Catholic doctrine. I didn’t make this up. I literally learned it in Catholic school.

Also a lot of crazy evangelicals and christian nationalists believe the rapture or some sort of christain version of the end times will come when the Jews are able to rebuild the third temple on the site of the temple mount (which is al-aqsa mosque). So they support Israel's hardliners who want to make that happen.

I know for a fact a lot of Republicans support Israel. Fox News constantly has segments that are supportive of Israel. Republicans also supported Trump's policies on Israel.
This reminds me of the funniest comment I ever saw on reddit. It was about a meeting between Trump and Putin, and that only the two of them were aware of the contents of the talks.
The stumbling block to that is there's no real common ground for them to have a discussion on with Russia and Ukraine.

A third party may be able to get past that. At bare minimum, the US might be able to get Russia to understand that we can fund Ukraine's war until the Ukrainians are tired of fighting and they really don't seem to be wearing out. Russia's military capacity is crumbling by the day.
This has been going through the courts for around 2 years. It's the court ruling that's just come out in favour of the settlers, seizing the land and evicting the palestinians who've been leasing it from the church and living there for 70 years.

There was a trial, and then a ruling. The new tenants won the court case, and were taking possession of there land. I would think most people would like things to work within the legal system, and not just a free for all.
Allotting the whole 900B defense budget to it isn't going to fix it, it'll just increase the budget of a broken system by 20%.
Americans will get healthcare they fix their currently broken system that costs twice as much as a not-broken system.

universal healthcare would cost American less than the current system. There is no financial obstacle to achieving it, its not a binary choice between military spending and healthcare.

Yep the obstacle is purely political will not financial. The US gov already spends more as a percentage of per capita GDP on healthcare than the likes of Canada, the UK or France.

The problem here is the de facto Republican leader is a Russian sympathiser, and the congressional GOP has frankly got a risible track record of standing up to Trump.

Trump is fucked, he's basically a Russian Asset, insurrectionist and corrupt fucker. But he's also something else: A Loser and a liability, this is why he won't have a chance, Republicans want to win the White House back but he's guaranteed to provoke people to vote against them so they'll quietly find a way to either get someone else the nomination for 2024 or slowly build a narrative to get him barred from Running. The Final Jan 6th report recommended him being barred it's up to them to use it to get rid of him.
It's the 21st fucking century. We've got to decide to do something about this. The resulting tragedies of various wars (including the Rwandan Genocide) can be traced directly to this abuse of mass media. After the lessons of WWII of Nazi Germany.
If the entire world hates Russia, and does not trust Russians, it's because they have worked very hard to earn a certain reputation.

It wasn't a moronic position to think that Russia would win at that time, either from a Russian, Ukranian or Western point of view. It was a reasonable assumption. On paper, knowing at least vaguely the amount of raw material, men and money going into the Russian military, a strong enough force to beat Ukraine should have come out of the other end of that black box. Instead, the hatch opened and some kind of gelatinous corrupted ooze dripped out and the rest is history.

I know you're doing poetry here, but to be honest, back when Kherson was taken, everybody knew far far less about the strenh and competence of the Russian military than we do now.
NK "We're actively practicing to nuke SK and US... and we're flying our mssiles over Japan because we can".
NK General: US and SK are sending bombers in a preemptive strike in response to our missile test launch drills.

The US also has a lot of forces on the ground in SK and Japan right now and has been conducting "show of force" military exercises with supersonic bomber squadrons over SK. Not to mention the ROK army are a disciplined, well equipped, modern army in their own right.

Overall it's in NK best interest to cause a stink once in a while to ensure aide keeps flowing to it, but to not actually tip into war.

If NK tried a conventional invasion into SK it would be an act of war and met with overwhelming conventional force -- NATO would dominate the skies with bombing campaigns, and then would invade NK with ground forces.

What the NATO forces need is for NK to strike first, this gives them justification to fire the missiles while keeping China back on its heels and out of the mix. But that is a gamble too because China just hopped into the fight back in '51 with no declaration or pretext, just hundreds of thousands of poorly equipped peasant conscripts charging south. China's political stance is to basically use NK as a "meat shield".

Same, I recall something about China and NK having a defensive part. I don't know if China would simply allow their buffer state to fall. I highly doubt that they would get involved though as I can't imagine China fighting the US and allies on at least 2, potentially 3 fronts (NK/China boarder, Taiwan/China, and potentially India/China - given some of their recent tensions).
"Many have also seen the visuals of Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul hobnobbing in Moscow this week with members of the Russian Council, sometimes called his "counterparts." These included the chairman of the council's foreign policy panel, Konstantin Kosachev, who happens to be under official U.S. sanction for his government's actions against our government.
Indeed, this sanction and other tokens of disapproval imposed on Russian officials in the past year have not seemed to chill the enduring warmth between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump. Paul carried a handwritten note from Trump to Putin on his trip.".

Is there no Karma for The Don? Is he just gonna live the rest of his selfish life in grievance and gold leaf diapers while sycophants jerk him off? Justice is a delusion. Not counting on Judgement Day to even the scales. Putin on the Ritz global crime syndicate forces of evil will throw us all out the 16th story balcony.

And apparently Merrill Garland’s take is “well, you know, you elected him, so it’s your own fault America. You don’t really want me to do anything, right?”.
Lol the Russians have lost more in 10 months of fighting than we did in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. There is no way they can last a decade. And yeah the arsenal of democracy should keep kicking the ever loving shit out of Russia for as long as that takes and if they want that to last another year or two, I’m here for it.
Which should be quite a while seeing as how Russia was our 2 enemy in terms of international politics and future wars, and we are getting a crazy return on what little money we've spent.

The war on terror cost trillions and lasted two decades. We've given Ukraine about $60B in military equipment and aid. They've ripped the Russian military apart at no small cost to themselves. They've shown us and the world that the Russian military is way more inept than we thought. Even China had to rethink their strategy after seeing how united the world was in aiding Ukraine and how fragile a nation-state Russia is when it comes to war against a nation with an actual military.

Question, given the monetary and military aid we're giving Ukraine, can that amount of funding go on for a decade, in the trillions, and or, if not, are we being fair to the Ukrainians to make them think we have an open commitment to them, for that as long?

Thank you for that submission, but i'm too old, and too smart to continue to listen these bs claims made by those in our media, so called "experts" at think tanks, and former floppies in the military that never won a war, since WW2.

Notwithstanding all of that, increasing the "Debt Ceiling" alone, with just Democrats is a task, let alone a Republican Party that is not one of the Neo Cons of the past that funded the "war on terror" (which was about our troops, not Ukraine).
You have to give them time to actually read what they’re voting on. Not allowing that is absurd and to not be able to discuss with colleagues is also absurd. The only thing we should actually change is going back to the talking fillibuster so that the minority can never indefinitely block a vote and to make more ways for the minority (or anyone) to force a vote on the floor so that it forces moderates in swing districts to actually vote or not and potentially lose their seat if they vote poorly and not hide behind the majority leader blocking uncomfortable votes.
Do you not know what the talking fillibuster is? It means that any member can keep a bill open for debate so long as they are actually standing up there and debating it’s to prevent people from rushing bills through, no one can talk forever, the most anyone was ever able to delay a vote with it was less than a week. There is no 60 vote threshold for anything. This is how it was until 2010 when McConnell got rid if it under Obama.

The GOP already got rid of this tradition when they were in power. The Democrats need to at least match the power grabbing. It’s not like the GOP is going to honor it when they are in power.

However (1) any training force is probably being trained just as competently as the original invasion force, at best; and (2) the Russians likely don't have supplies for those forces even if they've stripped the Belarusian Army to the studs.
They had 190,000 go in. They mobilized another 300,000 and brought another 50,000 - 100,000 from other regions.

There is no big additional mobilisation in Ukraine, as i know, because if its really 100k killed, you need to have at least 300k wounded.

In other way, with 100k killed, Russia spent their main troops, called the first mobilisation, and thinking about the second.

I keep seeing the 100'000 deaths figure but do we have an idea what Russia's total casualties might be (i.e deaths, wounded, mia). I also wonder how many POWs Ukraine has taken.

I would guess that the ukranian numbers contain quite a lot of heavily wounded. Its not like ukraine can distinguish between someone dead or lying screaming in a ditch with 2 extremities less in a square grit 30km away from the next ukrainian position.
Just go home. Death is the natural consequence of war. Diplomacy has proven ineffective and Russians ought to face the reality of their situation. The longer they remain on Ukrainian soil, the more people from both sides will die. Ukraine does not want to be part of Russia.
In the cold calculus of international affairs, the war has frankly been great for everyone but Russia and Ukraine. The EU. US. India. China. They're all going to walk out of this conflict having gained a lot. Ukraine frankly, probably just gets to live without losing as much as it could have.

Long term, this war will probably render Russia ever more irrelevant, reliant on China (and Iran of all places) for military and technological resources, India and Central Asia for markets that will favor the importers of Russian raw materials more than the exporters in Russia.

Russia's already flagging population is now going to be straddled with young men maimed for life and its political system might well collapse if this goes the same way the Soviet War in Afghanistan did.
I've tried my best, but when you live in a county that votes 75% red, it's kind of hard to feel like you can do anything to affect change at the local and state level.
Voting in republican primaries seems like the best chance people have to affect things when they're in a red enough area. There's zero chance any democrat will win in Indiana, so I'm going to vote in the republican primaries to try to keep the worst of the worst out of the general.

They won't do that if the only other viable candidate I'd Democrat. We need to start voting for a person instead of a party. There are many other political parties, some of which favor deconstructing big government. That seems attractive to me these days.

I don't see it that way at all. I think there's too much micromanaging from our government. Lobbying and campaign commercials should be a thing of the past. No more career politicians. We should be voting people into office who care about more than a career in that field. I hope that would help bring common sense back into governing. In fact, we should get rid of the party system altogether and come up with a different way to put checks and balances into place. It's so broken now, I don't see a way to fix it.
Biden should step down gracefully, saying something like he never intended on a second trem because of his age. A fresh face would only help the democrats by eliminating the republicans main attack strategy, his age. The democrats have several rising stars like cory booker (Obama 2.0). Avoiding kamala might be hard.
I don't believe all women are unlikable. I really liked Stacey abrams, maybe for VP. Kamala just has this prosecutor/mean teacher vibe. You can tell she has been trying to change this perception. As VP her press conferences have been much more approachable then earlier in the primaries.

Then do it in the re-election announcement speech. Do it on the stump. Do it at the Democratic National Convention speech. Biden is going to have plenty of opportunities to shit on Republicans. SOTU is about the country.

I'm all for politics, and even dirty politics, but the SOTU should be different. Sure, praise the things you've done, how they've helped the country, and set out your agenda for what you want to do in the future, but it's not the time for attacks.

Thunder run needs a massive advantage in quality and quantity of armor, so not gonna work here. It worked in kharkiv oblast because there was a lot of open terrain and low density of russian soldiers.
It appeared as though you were talking about kherson itself. Which would not work. Kherson oblast would still not work as well as it did in the east, but would be theoretically possible.

Russia cannot supply Kherson across the river. Russia cannot supply Kherson from the area they control to the East of Kherson, since there is another river and all the bridges there are gone as well.

The Russians may think they can make their great symbolic stand in Kherson. But the supply bandwidth will not be enough to keep military units and civilians alive. After the winter, Kherson will be rubble not because the Ukrainians shelled it, but because the Russians looted and destroyed everything to keep the troops alive. Ukrainians having precision artillery to strike Russian supply again and again will deplete the Russians.

If Ukraine took Kherson, it would have destroyed bridges and there is no good way to push South. Kherson is Dead End City for both sides at this point.
Kemp sounds like he has a mouth full of syrup when he talks. Walker sounds brain damaged, which he is.
Walker is the same thing here. Just utter incompetence sent out there with a 3 by 5 card with some catch phrases on it and a "go get em tiger" pep talk from his handlers. There's nothing wrong with not being capable of important jobs. Some things are just better off left to people with above average intelligence and this includes someone tasked with representing an entire state.

I did grow to almost like her despite running with actual traitors but it was more out of pity than anything else. She was led to believe she could do a job that was way out of her league and it all came crashing down.

So, this year, the Republicans ran this dipshit for secretary of state in California named Rachel Hamm. I swear, they ran her as a test case to see how effective their propaganda was with a baseline of utter incompetence for the job at hand in a state they knew they wouldn't win. I watched her quite a bit and she was in with the main crowd like Flynn and Bannon so there was a real effort to push her into the spotlight, but she is just absolutely clueless. She wasn't even that proficient in rattling off the fox news lines like most of them can do in their sleep.
Edit There have been several thoughtful replies to this that assert that the Supreme Court was citing the major questions doctrine and trying to restrict over reach by the EPA, claiming that the previous regulations embodied in the Clean Power Plan (CPP) encroached on the power of Congress.
> Rather, my argument is that the Court has begun to implement the policy preferences of its conservative majority in a new and troubling way: by simultaneously stripping power from every political entity except the Supreme Court itself. The Court of late gets its way, not by giving power to an entity whose political predilections are aligned with the Justices’ own, but by undercutting the ability of any entity to do something the Justices don’t like. We are in the era of the imperial Supreme Court.

Is there any real legal power from holding the title "chief justice" on SCOTUS? Or is it just a ceremonial title and the chief justice has the same legal power as the other 8 justices?

There are _no_ courts who have the authority to rule on the actions of the Supreme Court. And yet, we have a very long standing tradition that no man is a king, that no one may rule in their own case.

Worse, what do you do if the Supreme Court itself then rules that the attempts to add those justices is illegal?

my grandfather (bread used to be a quarter) says that he has never seen the prices go down to what they used to be. People see the number % given and since it is going down think inflation is going down. The rate might me slowing compared to last year but even if it was a 0% increase, the prices are still the same. You'd, I guess, need a negative percent to see the prices going down, but that won't happen. As soon as inflation stops rising, they will lower the interest rates.
Very little Biden has done has anything to do with inflation. Likewise, all of the Republicans attacking Biden for inflation and saying that they will somehow magically fix it are idiots.

Murkowski is a far better choice for Senate than the MAGA she was running against, but I voted for Chesbro, the Democrat with a background in education, as my first choice. When Chesbro was eliminated, my vote (like most who voted for her) was moved into Murkowski’s tally, giving Murkowski the win in the second round count.
Murkowski was down like .4% before ranked choice kicked in and then to the surprise of no one basically all chesbro (the Dem who was like 25% below both Murkowski and Tshibaka) voters had basically listed Murkowski 2nd and so she easily wins.

Tshibaka gets all the religious and MAGA voters. Murkowski gets the moderate republicans, moderate Dems, the Alaska natives and does weirdly well in the only progressive part of the state in the SE (probably because it's her hometown).

There aren't enough Dems in the state for a Democrat to win without winning the Alaska Native vote (see Peltola and Begich the last two Dems to win state wide). Murkowski as a write-in in 2010 pulled 80-90% in areas like Bethel and Barrow (now Utqiagvik). There's just no path for a Dem to win when Murkowski is on the ballot so no serious Dem even tries to compete vs her and they go after Sullivan instead who lacks Alaska Native support.
There were valid reasons for the Democrats to take the actions they did, and the vote was bipartisan because some Republicans agreed with their actions. This action from Republicans is just revenge politics for the sake of it and there are no valid reasons, for example, to deny Schiff a seat on his old committee or to remove Ilhan from her committee.
This is what’s truly Fascinating about this sub, the Democrats were the first people to throw opposing parties members off committees, they set the precedent.. Than Republicans do the same things and everyone cry’s foul. I’m no fan of the GOP, but damn you can’t be surprised when they return the favor, you don’t get to have it both ways….

Because no Democrats ever advocated for political violence in the last 5 years. Republicans didn’t remove them. They didn’t remove Rashida Talib, Omar for constantly tweeting anti Somatic Rhetoric.

You also don’t seem to understand that Opposition parties throwing people off committees was completely unprecedented in American politics until the Democrats literally did it first..

I’m most active in a Marxist sub…… I think you just have an incredibly tribal view on politics, we’re it’s his team good this team bad.. both parties have done there fair share of dooming this country. If you don’t think Obama and Hillary Clinton are two of the most machiavellian figures in American politics you really need to do yourself a favor and look into both parties.
Sorry, not assumptions. Evidence from other nations that have guns but also have regulations shows it’s true. It’s possible to have guns, have gun regulation, and also reduce gun violence.
Then why do other countries who have gun controls but also have similar mental health issues not have mass shootings??? Banning all guns is not the answer. Gun control is.

Gun control laws do not work in the US for a myriad of reasons. There are too many guns out there. Substantive gun control is always struck down as unconstitutional. Lately, any new gun control laws don't even address the problem (I don't believe any mass shooting has been perpetrated by a "ghost gun").

None of which, of course, have any bearing on mass shootings (no mass shooter has ever used a so-called “ghost” gun, and Colorado banned so-called high capacity magazines on 2013 under the promise that would curtail mass shootings).

If the claim is that banning “ghost” guns and so-called high capacity magazines will somehow reduce gun violence, put it in writing and agree to repeal the law in 5 years when it’s shown to have no effect.

All laws should have automatic repeal. They need to stipulate, as part of the law, exactly the intended outcome and exactly the expected costs. After 5 years, if they haven’t achieved the outcome, or they’ve exceeded the cost by 20% or more, it automatically is repealed.
Whether or not Russia's nuclear ICBMs still work, so much as an attempted launch on anyone and NATO will steamroll their way to Moscow. Especially after seeing the state of Russia's military as it is now.
Can we dispell this myth that Ukraine is protecting Europe and the world from Russia? Ukraine is protecting itself and the rest of the civilised world is injecting a buttload of money, weapons and intel so it can be effective.

Nah, this Russia is not a good faith actor, and needs to be exterminated in the battlefield with anything short of nukes for the good of the West and ultimately the world.

This whole invasion was demented so I doubt we would have been secure. Why would Russia not attempt to "fix" their Transnistria-Moldova historical problem after? Or support Serbia and interfere more in balcans after, especially with full manouverabilty on black sea? Have you seen what they were proposing Viktor Orban and nationalist Hungarians for Carpathians/Transilvanian area and Western Ukraine? If they agreed to something like that we would have to kick them out of EU... All this within the immediate geographic vicinity and reach post conquest of Ukraine, I am not even talking Nordics and NATO or Baltics or the border issues already happening with Poland/Bielorus.

If the war had gone well for Russia in Ukraine, they would have been emboldened regarding their (explicit) plans to “reclaim” territory that is now in the EU and NATO. Europe’s original plan was to watch with horror as Ukraine fell in a matter of days. Russia would then reasonably assume there might be a weak response if they attacked the Baltics, for example.
Don't be mistaken here, Sweden's paltry support for the Syrian Kurds is not a serious security threat to Turkey. Erdogan is just trying to milk the situation for as much political benefit as possible before elections next year.
The YPG isn't Marxist-Leninist and hasn't been for a long time. And I'm sorry, but it is about "the Kurds" to some degree because the central reason the PKK has support is because of discrimination against Kurds in Turkey.

Anyway, many different Kurdish factions fought against Isis, Turkeys issue is with the YPG who they consider a rebrand of the PKK.the same YPG who are now getting closer to Iran and Russia btw.

The leaders of the YPG have participated in PKK activities, they have been trained by and are the result of it.

Ah ok, so Al Qaeda fought against Russia back in the 80’s with the support of USA, so they were considered good guys right? Until they weren’t?
Additionally, the chamber would consider preventing non-emergency drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a tool the Biden administration has regularly used amid rising gas prices in recent months. Gas prices are Bidens fault He should do something and No We won't let him do anything to bring those prices down again.
The package would allow the House to consider stripping the Internal Revenue Service of additional resources Biden's Inflation Reduction Act made available to the agency last summer. Can't have the IRS going after the rich!

...the committee would investigate COVID's origins, "the impact of school closures on American children," and the development of vaccines and corresponding federal mandates. They keep trying to imply that Fauci is somehow responsible for Covid. I mean, it started in China... you know, the place Trump paid more taxes to than the U.S.

I think it originated in China, but who are you going to hold accountable? Why spend on looking backwards? Surely the point is to make the virus as harmless as possible.
The end result was 58.8% to 40.6%. again huge margins, but nothing like what the map would indicate. 40% of the population was not in favor of Reagan.
They were recounting before the SC made that decision and there was a riot that stopped the recounts. The riot was lead by Roger Stone and at least one other person. Without that riot Gore very likely could have pulled off a win in FL and became president. Between Roger Stone and the SC they stole that election for Bush, and we will never know who should have actually won it.

That election wasn't close, but it was closer than people realize. That map, like all national election maps, doesn't tell the story accurately at all.

Just to clarify. 40% of the people who voted were not in favor of Reagan. Typically less than half the population of the US ever votes.

I’m going to guess that a lot of people decided not to vote in the midterm since Illinois is usually so guaranteed. Also the slander against Pritzker has been very intense his entire term, and the backlash against the lockdowns, even in Chicago and the suburbs, was very loud.
Did a switch flip? Amazing how overnight, Republicans and conservative forums everywhere are suddenly lamenting, seemingly in unison, that Trump “is only in it for himself”, he’s going to “divide the country” to “satisfy his ego”, and it’s “time to abandon Trump”.
When someone tries to argue that the Republican Party is not in thrall to Trump, that he doesn’t represent the majority of Republicans, all you have to look at to know they’re wrong - not necessarily lying, but deluded - is the above.

Remember, Senate Republicans - the topmost leaders in the Republican Party - had two chances to convict Trump and bar him from office after the House impeached him twice. If even a small minority of Senate Republicans agreed to convict on either impeachment offense would have seen him barred from future office. Had they done so, they would not have to deal with Trump and the possibility of him running again.

If Trump announces his 2024 presidential run, then it is on. If he doesn't announce, then he likely caved to outside pressure and I don't see that happening after the last 6 years.
Edit: holy shit, so many people completely miss a point which I thought to be apparent: I'm not suggesting Greece take over Turkey, I'm pointing that out to show how ridiculous any Turkish claim to Greek Islands in the Aegean sea is. The paranthases are there for a reason.
Turkey is an established fact. But when they make claims to Greek islands based on Ottoman rule, Turks should keep in mind that they are the latecomers in the Balkans.

The funny thing is that the majority of turks are greek descendants - a proven fact Turks find really inconvenient. Meaning that it's literally a Greek land occupied by mostly greeks.

I was more focusing on Greece as a country, not the Hellenic people. Turkey is essentially a successor state to the Ottomans, but Greece literally didn’t exist as a modern country until the Greek Revolution.

Greece and Turkey have had a long long standing hatred of one another, stemming all the way back to the Greeks declaring independence from the Ottomans. It has ebbed and flowed over the years with both nations moving toward negativity since the fall of the Soviet Union which removed their largest common adversary.
What does anything they say matter? Finland and Sweden made an agreement with the Turkish government. They were doing what Turkey wanted them to do, and I'm sure that deal didn't have any clause saying "if some nutbag burns a koran, all bets are off!".
Pffffft. They went in and fought against the Kurds. They weren't fighting against Russia or Syria, they were fighting for them. And Libya is still a mess.

We have long range missile systems that are accurate enough that NATO can close that down with or without Turkish assistance.

Yeah turkey basically did what every corrupt dirty state does. First they lied to Sweden and Finland about a smooth process. Then they suddenly produced a list with outlandish demands. Then they tried to curb the very freedoms a NATO membership is meant to protect.
No, it's quite the opposite. Since I have a gun and therefore can use overwhelming force to protect myself, I'm calmer and less fearful, meaning I'm less likely to scream and yell at people. And because I also know other people have guns, I'm also less likely to escalate the situation to the point where I may die.
I don’t know why you’d just assume they don’t know this, but okay, I’m a gun owner and advocate, and I am more than aware of these things.

If you actually tried to pay the least bit of attention and debate honestly, you’d realize they aren’t talking about gun control whatsoever in the comment you responded to - they’re talking about voting for conservatives in general, and they are completely right about the bigotry and intolerance.

To everyone who thinks that gun owners are fools for being single-issue voters, just remember that the Democrats also think gun control is more important than every other issue or they would drop it so we can progress on those other more important issues.

Either way, gun rights absolutists loooooove to cling to outlier cases like these while ignoring the fact that more shootings have been stopped by unarmed citizens than armed, and virtually none of those stopped by unarmed citizens appear on the top deadliest lists.

Look - I value my right to self-defense by firearm, but suggesting gun control doesn’t work is simply ignoring the absolute magnitudes of data that indicate the exact opposite.

But statistically speaking, you are more likely to die by your own gun than to stop a violent criminal with it.

Why do you think other countries with strict gun control have substantially fewer mass killings? Clearly criminals aren’t just turning to knives, cars, planes, and explosives at anywhere near the same rate - at least not successfully so.
He’s not wrong, but at the same time India must live with aligning themselves with Russia on this issue against basically the entire rest of the world.
So, Reddit comrades you can think of all you want; with the weapon cache that India has and public sentiment for Russia; India will never be against Russia in the near future. This government is loud about this thing as this has been helping them politically by playing those sentiments.

Every dog has its day. Then it was west's now it's India's. Wait for yours to reply. Which seems like a long way now as the power dynamics is changing rapidly. West being afraid of China, rightfully so. The only way to counter it is with India. Maybe after that fight is over, IF you win; focus on India.

India has nukes so there is no realistic possibility of a full scale war with China. If India didn’t have them then there is a realistic need to choose an ally who would defend us better. In that case India would have tried to ally with the US even against their own interests. But thankfully we have nukes and the deterrence effect helps in keeping our ground and act based on what helps our interests the best.

If you think India relies on Russia’s military to defend ourselves then you’re joking here. We never did.

If only right wing media and politicians had any shame. They just deny most things, even when someone like you brings the receipts. I've been telling my family for years Donald Trump is a con artist and only out for himself, but they won't have it. The immediate reaction is <latest Fox News talking point> or classics like Hunter or HRC. There is zero introspection, ever. Just eternal foolish pride or deflection: "I'm not that interested in politics," instead of ever admitting fault. Cultural division for profit has been going on for ages, but today's conservative media has perfected the art.
The Democratic party will usually at least admit what is and isn't fact. Whether they address a problem and if they do it anything about it is completely different. The US and most countries it seems now have shifted so far to the right that "fairness" or equal opportunity is somewhere way down the list behind the very first thing, which is increasing profits for a select few. It's so frustrating.

gun culture in the 90s had a massive culture shift due to the ruby ridge/Waco. Lawayne Pierre, head of the NRA ended up having an internal memo leak in 95' which lead to a lot of old guard conservatives (like HW bush) to reject the NRA. Its also the time where they changed their philosophy to what gun culture has become now.
All that said, even with owning both styles of firearms, this country is wackadoo on guns and there are a plethora of common sense reforms that should be made. There are far too many people that fetishize their guns and fantasize about taking another humans life in this country.

There are always going to be gun nuts who think they're going to overthrow the government, but there are also a lot of moderates who see guns as what they are: tools for rural life. I think most people can agree on a lot of gun control (like background checks, gun safes, proper safety training), but think (however wrongly) that "liberals are just going to take away their guns". Demonizing them is just going to make them dig in their heels, and that's just part of human nature; instead, by incorporating them as stakeholders in a future solution, that solves two problems at the same time.

Well, it's kind of a difficult conversation to have if you own a gun; of course you personally are a responsible gun owner who isn't going to shoot anybody, so why should you face more restrictions?

One way to approach this is to to tell gun owners: "of course, you're responsible gun owners who keeps their guns locked up and secured, and you've gone through training and know the basic rules of gun safety, unlike those irresponsible gun owners who are besmirching the good name of gun owners everywhere.".

Okay. So what is that based on? I can see the argument about weight, and of course that makes a great difference to some.
I have learned, in the past few years, that ignorance isn’t a defense for low level offenders. There are tons of laws where the prosecution needs to demonstrate intent.
And Law means nothing if it’s not enforced. You can make all the “rules” and “laws” you want, but if nobody enforces them… you might as well not have them.
And Law means nothing if it’s not enforced. You can make all the “rules” and “laws” you want, but if nobody enforces them… you might as well not have them.

I think there should be enforceable ethics laws, but it's hard to think of a good way to implement and enforce them.
I'm not sure if there is a legal mechanism to create a binding code of ethics for the Supreme Court. If it isn't airtight, the Supreme Court could even rule instituting a code is unconstitutional. At that point, I believe impeachment of justices would be the only legal remedy, and removal would require a majority of the House and super majority in the Senate. That is not going to happen.

That’s very obviously false, as that title unquestionably belongs to the former guy, but notice how Fox skirts liability by inserting a quote from a mouthpiece into the title to guide readers to their desired position. “No no, we’re not falsely claiming that Biden is the biggest serial liar elected, we’re just reporting on someone else who did. \ wink wink ”.
The headline implies that Biden is the "Biggest serial liar elected," which is patently false. President Biden would have to be lying at a rate of twenty-one lies per day to top . Fox knows this, which is why they had to quote someone else falsely calling Biden the "Biggest serial liar elected" instead of saying it themselves.

I think the biggest serial liar elected definitely goes to Trump, but it does appear that Biden made this story up. Both his father and his uncle died before he was elected Vice President in 2008.

" You know, I — my dad, when I got elected Vice President, he said, “Joey, Uncle Frank fought in the Battle of the Bulge.” He was not feeling very well now — not because of the Battle of the Bulge. But he said, “And he won the Purple Heart. And he never received it. He never — he never got it. Do you think you could help him get it? We’ll surprise him.”So we got him the Purple Heart. He had won it in the Battle of the Bulge. And I remember he came over to the house, and I came out, and he said, “Present it to him, okay?” We had the family there.I said, “Uncle Frank, you won this. And I want to…” He said, “I don’t want the damn thing.” (Laughter.) No, I’m serious. He said, “I don’t want it.” I said, “What’s the matter, Uncle Frank? You earned it.” He said, “Yeah, but the others died. The others died. I lived. I don’t want it.”Just like a generation — this generation in Vietnam — excuse me, in — in Iraq.

But he said, “And he won the Purple Heart. And he never received it. He never — he never got it. Do you think you could help him get it? We’ll surprise him.”So we got him the Purple Heart. He had won it in the Battle of the Bulge. And I remember he came over to the house, and I came out, and he said, “Present it to him, okay?” We had the family there.I said, “Uncle Frank, you won this. And I want to…” He said, “I don’t want the damn thing.” (Laughter.) No, I’m serious. He said, “I don’t want it.” I said, “What’s the matter, Uncle Frank? You earned it.” He said, “Yeah, but the others died. The others died. I lived. I don’t want it.”Just like a generation — this generation in Vietnam — excuse me, in — in Iraq.
One possible innocuous answer: It could be that Uncle Frank was wounded but for whatever reasons he did not earn / qualify for a purple heart.
Caste systems aren't exclusive to India or Hinduism. It affects other countries (e.g. Pakistan and Bhutan) and other religions (Muslims, Sikh, Buddhists) as well. Banning caste systems in general doesn't go against any specific religion or ethnicity.
Caste-based discrimination is a serious issue, and I have never argued otherwise. We have endured a lot of hardship in the past as a result of this practise, so it is more than just a problem. But I don't believe that discrimination like this occurs in Seattle. There is no concrete proof of this claim. Sawant is promoting her unlawful caste proposal to target the South Asians.

What should I do, exactly? Should I have to bring it up every time I speak? what do you want exactly? There is always the possibility that some other communities will have greater privileges than yours, and you may have to deal with prejudice there, which is something that happens more frequently. Where will this downward spiral eventually lead? Because there are more hierarchical structures than humans could possibly enumerate, discrimination between humans does not always result from community status, despite the fact that it is frequently the main factor. And based on the way you are speaking, I don't believe you want to stop this obscene tradition. You want other people to express regret for crimes they didn't even commit. You are getting a subconscious pleasure that somehow you are fighting for the casteism atrocities but in the mean while I think you are damaging more than anyone else you are more casteist than an average Brahmin.

I've never thought of my Caste as being "high" or "superior" at any level, either. It's a complicated matter, so if you want to understand why individuals like Sawant are targeting the South Asians in Seattle, you should read about caste and as well as about the caste-based reservation system.

Sawant even went so far as to argue that we don't even need studies! She would simply brand South Asians as casteists and instruct Seattle Council to trust her and her allies, disregarded the opinions of the vast majority of people who really live and work in Seattle.
“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,”.
"The strategy is not for defense, but for the defeat of the russian army and the victory of Ukraine. Leopard tanks will be followed by F16 aircraft, Atacms missiles and other weapons we need.".

Yep. Despite the West’s alignment with Ukraine and against Russia, the type and amount of financial and material support from them is and has always been a matter of strategy.

It is Ukrainians’ initial and continued tenacity that has made Western nations comfortable with sending tools to push Russia off the map in a standing land battle.

The West will rightly do everything in it's power to help Ukraine win as long as they are willing to fight, even as they grapple with the fact that they don't want to get directly involved.

But if by any chance, Russia manages to conquer Ukraine, it's pretty inevitable that because of that threat/geopolitics etc, sooner or later the West would have to go "fine we'll do it ourselves".

It should be obvious to any astute observer that wants peace that the best and perhaps only way for that to happen is for Russia to leave Ukraine.
One of the major issues for their Air Force isn’t a lack of planes or pilots, but a lack of munitions for their jets. Jet munitions are “smart” munitions and Russia isn’t able to make more of those with the sanctions. The only use their jets have are as kamikaze weapons since any intelligence application has been taken over by harder to target drones.
And bear in mind it's not just the aircraft and its tech, but the missiles, pilots integration of systems.

Also on top of jets, the ammunitions play a big role, and russian jet-fired weapons are league behind except in air to ground.

Russia is flying theirs low because they don't have stockpiles of precision munitions, so they have to fly lower to help ensure unguided bombs hit the target.

USAF determined the cost just wasn't worth it. F-22 is slated to be phased out starting in a decade, and they didn't think Russia or China would have enough stealth aircraft to require those investments.

F-35 is quite a bit more advanced than the F-22. The USAF wanted to export the F-22 to lower costs, and stated there was no reason to ban exports of it if they were going to be exporting the F-35, but Congress is just fucking stupid and banned it against the advice of literally everyone.

Iran would likely use their Su-35s in a pure air to air capacity, so that risk from MANPADS doesn't apply to them.
Which is exactly why the warheads would be removed and switched with conventional warheads weeks before ever being given to the front. No one is going to be like “hey here’s a nuke” plops it down off truck “mind taking the nuke off and switching it for me?” To anyone near the front.
What would be the point of a nuke if it's the same yield as a tomahawk missile? That's just nonsense. Those warheads are likely 5-20KT, the typical yield of a tactical nuclear warhead.

This missile wasn't just a nuclear-capable missile with a normal warhead. This missile had no warhead, unless you count a lump of concrete ballast as a warhead. That's what made this so weird, Russia either launched a Kh-55 as a kinetic missile (+ whatever fuel is left behind), which would be really pathetic if true. Or they launched it as a test for how an actual nuclear armed one might go.

I think they're actually checking them all now, and anything that won't work as a nuke is being launched.

90’s and early 2000 were good relation for US and Russia. Don’t say never. We had business arrangements and influence on their culture, but Putin and the Oligarchs fucked that up.

Bullshit. They funnel personal benefits through their businesses. They hold their wealth in assets they take advantage of yet don’t pay taxes on. They use the stock market to cheat on income. They build shell companies out of country. They build trusts that are impossible for the IRS to navigate. They underpay employees comparative to inflation. They create “charities” to hide their wealth. Etc.

If the US government isn't going to give me my PREPAID BENEFITS (yes I'm entitled to them because I fucking paid for them, stop using entitlements as a dirty word) then I might as well be able to start investing this money on my own... and I'd like it all back.
Kelantan is facing floods and the fucker Minister there said it's because of rain and it's normal , that's all and nothing else. I've been seeing a trend of fascists these fuckers been going, which they're partnering with other parties under the National Alliance coalition.
True. The King was very wise at making choice, and he knew his decision was right because he's probably so pissed of Muhyidin's (Moodin) behaviour, the chairman of Nasional Alliance and also former 8th Prime Minister.

As someone from Malaysia, it's not surprising that its the northern states, Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah that are ruled by the Malaysia Islamic Party (PAS). I'm a Muslim too but it's ridiculous they're implementing laws like these that are not irrelevant to the current situation.

Countries think about a lot of factors before partnering up with another. India has the economic and military potential that's why Usa sees it as valuable to partner up. Also politically India has good relations with alot of countries already like France , Japan , Israel which also happen to be Us allies. So Usa has a very good reason to partner up with India (also democratic).
Military aid can be expected from India when the ties deepens not before obviously. From your replies it seems you are not well educated on international ties so you should watch this video.

Edit: Indian govt has provided humanitarian aid which is not comparable to Russian citizens giving humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid includes alot of things but the ones India sent is probably medical equipment and medicines.

Well I think medicines and health aid should count in military aid as most of it will ultimately find its use in helping wounded soldiers.

I’ve found that smaller spaces have had gender neutral bathrooms for a long time because well, they have only 1 bathroom.

Exactly! And gender neutral bathrooms in Sweden are mostly just a practical thing and have nothing to do with trans. There has been a recent movement for making life easier or trans people which have made gender neutral bathrooms slightly more common (and I am certainly not opposed to that), but in most cases it just as to do with efficient use of space.

I've always wondered about everyone who feels unease or claims some sort of psychological trauma regarding gender-neutral bathrooms. Like, do they make each gender use a separate bathroom in their homes? Do they avoid doing anything in the bathroom when their spouse is in the shower or taking a bath? Do they curtain off the toilet to segregate it from everyone else, and if so how is this different than the cubicles in public gender-neutral restrooms?

This sort of defeated the whole purpose as that's definitely now a male-coded bathroom and the other is by extent female.
He’s a Republican. He is going to do Republican things, that’s a given. My only point here was to point out that when it comes to Trump we would have an impeachment if other Republicans followed his lead.
Romney also voted Once not to impeach him AND helped Trump steal two SCOTUS seats. He also votes lock step with the GOP on Judges and refused to vote on anything bipartisan like infrastructure that the Dems worked out deals with the GOP for. Romney isn’t a man of principals. He is an opportunist. His vote to impeach was only to set him up to survive the Grand old Purge that’s about to happen to his party when the pendulum swings back towards sanity. At least opportunist cowards like Paul Ryan hid during Trumps reign so he could return an look like a return to sensibility. The reality is all of the GOP enabled all of Trumpism Romney included.

Romney did not endorse Trump, did not vote for Trump, and voted twice to convict Trump. Romney has repeatedly, consistently, and regularly criticized Trump for seeding racism, white supremacy, being a fascist demagogue, and generally being a unpresidential narcissistic blowhard.

Just my opinion, we should embrace and differentiate Republicans who are willing to work with us on at least some issues. Seems like everyone is waiting for 30 years from now when we may have 75% of both the House and Senate, and also have the WhiteHouse and Supreme Court.
He has to run again. In his mind, it's the only thing keeping him from being indicted. I honestly don't know whether he could get the nomination over DeSantis, but my dream scenario is they both run, DeSantis gets the nomination, and Trump runs as an independent, splitting the conservative vote. He's easily narcissistic enough to knowingly sink Republican's chances of retaking the white house in order to be able to proclaim his immunity from prosecution for another 2 years because he's a political candidate. It's not even like DeSantis could promise him a pardon if he drops out, because 1, there's no way Trump can let himself believe DeSantis could succeed where Trump failed, and 2, it looks like some of the charges coming are at the State level, so a presidential pardon wouldn't reach that far.
If Trump runs, even if he ends up losing to Desantis, Trump will expose every dirty secret about Desantis, and make him look weak with insults that Desantis doesn't fight back, and claim he is a secret Democrat in a red suit. If Trump loses, he'll very likely trash Desantis and refuse to stump rallies in support, and will pull away MAGA voters that don't want any alternative and will sit out the election.

DeSantis is a bit more savvy than Trump, so I don't see him making that deal as it wouldn't benefit DeSantis in the long-run and would lose votes of those who oppose Trump.
It varies. In my company, we have 3 sick days which are added to our PTO. If we don't get sick, we have 3 extra days of PTO (that will even roll over). We are changing this on the new year, we are giving everyone an extra week of PTO, and turning those 3 days into legit sick days.
If you are out sick, you can’t retroactively use a PTO day to cover it? I’ve never heard of a company that doesn’t have a mechanism for that.

I think a lot of developed countries work that way. I don’t even mind the system we use so long as people have adequate PTO that builds up over years. Starting at none like you mention is crazy, but reading in to it, a lot of workers start at 10-15 days, too, but still probably hard to use them as you mention.

I do hear you tho. I wish Congress had the votes to do it but they don’t unfortunately. Doing nothing (leading to the strike) would also be a disaster. Shame the rail workers are getting caught in the middle.

Here’s something I don’t see being discussed much. In most industries in America, for better or for worse, sick time is bundled in to general PTO. In my industry it’s 3.5 weeks to start typically, going to 5 with time. Sounds like the rail workers have a similar deal, but have the weird points system. What they want is an additional 15 days sick time on top of the PTO. This would be more like how Europe PTO/sick leave works. Everyone is making it sound like rail workers have no PTO but this isn’t quite true. God I’d love to have 15 days of sick leave on top of five weeks PTO. We’re employee owned though, we set our own policy, and that is not a realistic policy even for us.
It is effectively mandatory though. If you are in an active border conflict and join NATO then you can invoke article 5, leaving NATO in a horrible spot where they have to choose between getting involved in a preexisting conflict that didn't involve NATO at all, or to show the world and all member states that it doesn't take article 5 seriously.
But all of this may mean nothing because if it's determined that NATO without Ukraine is going to inevitably trigger Article 5 in the future because it didn't help Ukraine today.

if at some point Ukraine will be able to join NATO, that would only happen after Russia's complete defeat , which will never happen (nukes being one of the reasons). And if it were to happen , what is the point to join NATO?

Step 1) government covers all healthcare costs. Step 2) healthcare premiums and benefits are no longer included in wages, resulting in an increase in direct pay\ Step 3) corresponding tax increases would be less than the increase in pay.

Putin could see that part of the reason Russia was doing so badly in Ukraine was because of the duplicated command structures and political infighting to secure favour.
It's a massive task coordinating something like that amongst militaries that trust each other (e.g., NATO) but it's impossible when the commanders of your separate militaries hate each other more than the enemy they're fighting.

Putin can't allow Wagner PMC to be too much "efficient" in the battlefield in a level that it would obscure the Russian army, it could threaten his power base. That's the thing with dictatorships, "give a man too many battles and a man will forget who is the king".
I doesn't make sense that Russia did this on purpose (if they even did it in the first place). You don't risk a war with NATO over something like this... Of course, the possibility exists, but it just doesn't make sense.
Yes they are at fault, but context matters and they consequences change depending on it. Firing on Poland and firing on Ukraine and hitting Poland by accident are 2 diferrent things.

Could have been fired by Russia towards Ukraine but due to a technical difficulty in the rocket / middle hit Poland instead.

From what I've read it was a Ukrainian anti-air missile that hit a Russian missile which landed within Polish territory. Put simply, it was an accident. Russia isn't ballsy enough to jump on that nerve.

A lot of Russians aren’t buying the full war with NATO lie. And those near the top putting pressure on Putin aren’t buying it either. If there was at least a partial war, that changes things.

I mean, yeah. He can’t accept Ukraines terms (which are perfectly reasonable) because that would be a lose that not even Russia propaganda could spin in his favor. If the war keeps going on like this Ukraine will win.

Yes but you are forgetting Putin doesn't work in the best interest of Russia, or even actions that typically make sense. He just does things that he can spin in his favor. A limited war with NATO could work in his favor, not Russia's, but his.

That's a given, they had one reason to go to war with Ukraine, and that was to try to revive the "great soviet empire" (USSR) as Putin's legacy. Turns out his massive armies of unwavering troops are getting stomped by a country he thought was weak.
Looking around my area, the price of a home went up like 30% during the pandemic. The higher interest rates have dropped the prices like 10% from the peak, but have also made the actual cost of a mortgage on one of those houses go up 60% from 2021. New construction has also cratered in the midst of a housing crisis.
So the rich that can pay all cash for a house are having a field day. And the middle and working class (we’re talking families with 100k+ incomes) are just completely shut out.

Shipping costs have returned to prepandemic normal but the price of everything staying high. I guess the inflation rate has slowed, but this sure doesn’t feel like winning.

The purpose of the rate hikes is to slow the economy. The way that happens is by making debt more expensive, so businesses that are only still running because of access to cheap debt will go under. That’s how it affects unemployment.

But, Jerome Powell said himself they need downward pressure on wages and increased unemployment. If you keep wage growth pegged to the ideal inflation of 2% wages never grow for those on the bottom rung. Wages for the lowest earners have remained effectively stagnant while C suite pay packages explode. I understand that rate hikes in stated purpose are to slow the economy by making borrowing more expensive but there are also other effects intended. Especially when you pretend the only cause of inflation is too much money and too much demand. Which from the beginning was not the case with this inflation. It was started by massive supply chain issues compounded by Russia’s invasion and profiteering. CEOs have been crowing about it in earnings calls.

The feds foundational belief is that there needs to be a threshold of unemployment that is necessary to keep wage pressure downward. I think it foolish to continue to operate as if wage hikes are the best option to slow inflation.

We can’t expect the rate hikes to work their way through the economy so quickly. Housing still has a way to go to correct. It takes time for sellers to accept the newer reality of lower prices.

Regardless if the interest rate goes up or down the people who have an incentive to make it about “hurting the poor” will find something to rail against.
Which, by the way, the IRS should not release, and for the very same reason Trumps had to be released.
Trump, OTOH, promised to release his returns, so this is just holding him to his word, along with everything else you mentioned.

My argument against that would be that Trump and/or anyone else should not be allowed to get away with lie after lie about planning to release his returns, and why he has not done so yet. It would be a dangerous precedent to set that someone should be allowed to run for and be elected to the most powerful position in the United States while still keeping financial secrets form the voting public.

POTUS works for us. We are not their subjects. Anyone who wants that position but also wants to keep things like their tax records a secret, should just piss off. It'll cost us a few tax evading candidates, but I am confident there will still be plenty of people lining up for the job on both sides of the aisle. Maybe it would scare away billionaires from running. Which is nothing but a plus.
Plenty of cultures eat insects (good source of protein!), it isn't any weirder than eating snails in France or shrimp in general. Certainly it isn't shockingly inhumane, especially in a situation where they literally can only eat what they can farm or grow on a moving train.
These are people who not too long ago ate each other to survive, and they act like getting nutrition from mashed up insects is a horrifying and debasing thing.

I really do wonder what the people who want to eat insects in this thread are really like and why they think eating insects is fine. Do they think it’s exotic? Or do they do it out of ethical reasons? Do they realize rich people will never touch the stuff or at least no more than they touch fast food or shit from the frozen food section?

That isn’t it, or else the horror would be when they discovered the rich people’s food cars. Those scenes are more understandably anger.
That's one of the many issues that would come up during the potential negotiations, but almost nobody is happy with the status quo. Also, this article isn't even about Greene so much as it is about secession in general. The original title was simply "We need to talk about disunion", and I don't think they needed to change it.
Blame the magazine, unfortunately. The article originally was published under the title of "we need to talk about disunion", and then it was changed at some point within the last day.

Interesting article first published under the title "we need to talk about disunion". Not sure why the name changed, but it is an interesting read. It is essentially a liberal's case in favor of secession, rather than the condemnation that other outlets have heaped on the issue.

Kreitner did write about the subject as part of his book back in 2020, where he said in part that "Far from settling the dispute that led to the cataclysm, 𝘛𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘴 𝘷 𝘞𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘦 brushed it aside... The argument for secession was never properly countered through logic or law, but was suppressed by overwhelming force— a verdict ratified, almost as an afterthought, in a perfunctory judicial diktat.".

Wow. I left the US almost 4 years ago, and my home country feels unrecognizable. If she's that serious, why not do a pilot study like the 4 day work week one in the UK. Let's test these insane ideas!
I have actually a long time had this issue with Amnesty, they have a lot of valid criticisms but they hold people to a ridiculously high standard which dilutes their message.
Nah, they have a long time criticized Russia. I had plenty of issues with their report on Ukraine (they had padded the report with things which are not war crimes to make Ukraine look bad) but they have written more reports about Russia than about Ukraine.

Even if it's true that Amnesty was criticizing Russia for a long time, the fact remains that they made Ukraine out to be the bad guys in the headlines while Russia was attempting to take the country.

I know everyone still remembers that idiotic article a while ago, but it has to be said that Amnesty International has written plenty of articles against Russia before that too. It's not like they're only now changing their tune.

They still deserve all the ridicule and scorn for that dumb an article. Which was not only based on dodgy information, but also just written poorly.
That's all it is, the places that actually look after their staff have no problems. It makes for great headlines though, "no one wants to work anymore" is just eaten up by the older demographics that still consume legacy media.
The incomplete headline should read: Pubs struggle to retain staff for same/lower wages after Brexit and Covid 'double whammy'.

It's kind of weird that this headline completely ignores the main reason they're struggling to retain staff -- low wages. All Brexit did was get rid of migrant workers from Eastern Europe who would be fine rooming with 5 other people in a 1 bedroom flat. The only impact from COVID is that people are far more reluctant to work a job that requires frequent physical contact with strangers, particularly for fuck all pay.

If they offered a decent wage, they wouldn't have these issues, but then they might need to jack up the cost of a pint, so it's far easier to just overwork the few desperate employees that remain.

Ironically those described as essential workers during lockdown are the least paid where as the people who are paid decently can work from home, shouldn't it be the other way round??

McCarthy has already said that it is for the voters of his district to decide. He basically said that they voted him in and they can recall/vote him out and the only way that McCarthy will remove him is if he broke and is convicted of breaking campaing laws.

They aren’t tho. It’s not like the government asks the people where the budget should go. Corruption leads to money flowing places that the people have little control over.
But it not like they all hate each other. It’s government policy. I’m no expert on the situation but to me it seems that for both sides conflict keeps them in power. On the Israeli side you have the far-right nationalists who feed on fear and on the other you have basically the same thing but with a bit of extremist Islam mixed in there.

I’m not saying either is right, I’m just saying Palestine increasingly looks less like they want a civil end to this, and are pushing further and further towards extremism. Can you genuinely say you think the Jews in Israel would be safe is Palestine was granted the entire territory? I’m just saying, Arabs under Israel are way better off then Jews would be under Palestine.

Absolutely false. The US did the Natives waaaaaaay worse than Israel could ever do with Palestinians. I’m sure the Palestinians could read the treaties fine, and there’s no basis to assume Israel wouldn’t keep to their treaty obligations.

Israel believes it has a right to exist as an independent nation with peace and security as a primary goal. They also believe that they need living space similar to the Nazi concept of Lebensraum or the American concept of Manifest Destiny. The idea is that since they fought in wars and won these territories they eventually have the right to settle these areas and call them their own. The process of settling these areas safely has been slow and has required ever so slowly pushing the borders on Jerusalem and East Jerusalem and pushing into unoccupied territories of Palestine in the north. They believe this is all justified because these territories originally belonged to Egypt, Lebanon and Syria and they legally acquired these territories as reparations while fighting defensive wars against these nations.
Hilarious that this guy might be the reason the Russian mobiks are underequipped. Who knew the weapons he sold off from soviet stockpiles would be badly needed by russian conscripts 30 years later.
I think he was a lieutenant in the Soviet Union before he was caught selling those weapons to countries in Africa. Do we know if the weapons he sold were anything other than Soviet Union's weapons stocks from the Cold War? Aren't the same stock piles being used for the war in Ukraine now?

Or get kickbacks from Ukraine for supplying them weapons through willingly abandoned Russ equipment? He seems more like an equal opportunity player, as shit as the game he plays is, I suspect something like this is being worked out now.

This is true insofar as that his primary contacts were Ukrainian who hated the old USSR and wanted to rid themselves of any association. My guess? He's leveraging those contacts again, but all of them are VERY pro-Ukrainian. He'll have an easier time supplying Ukrainian forces with equipment than Russ forces.

Well now he can help arm those Russian soldiers without proper equipment. Meanwhile we got a tourist back that didn't listen to the US State Department when they said to GTFO.
They don’t care. They’ve never cared about this kind of stuff. Some lives are destroyed and lost?? Pfffft, who cares. “Some of you may die but this is the price we’re willing to pay” is literally the central thought of how some people view countries around Russia.
Somebody once said that Russia is in WWII-death cult, in which they see that killing the enemy and be killed in a fight against nazis is one of the golden dreams that most modern Russians (who have grown up under Putin’s new “Stalin was great!” country) should strive towards. If you grow up in such an environment, all these crimes you listed are just badges of honour against your perceived enemies.

In Russians’ eyes, at least those who truly support putin and his megalomania, Russia cannot be the one committing such crimes because crimes against humanity are only committed against innocents, but clearly - Ukrainians and anybody who is anti-Russia (read: anti-Purim’s Russia; anti Russia that is an empire and PITA of its neighbours) is not an innocent and therefore deserves the most painful horrific death ever.

The US didn't exactly plant the bodied of thousands of executed Ukrainian civilians behind the Russian retreat from eastern Ukraine, or ship thousands of kids off to Russia, oe have tens of thousands of rape victims, or make videos of Russian forces torturing and castrating Ukranian prisoners of war.

Russia doesn’t need the US’ help to “demonize”… They became demons shortly after their initial invasion… all by themselves; raping women and children… torture… shooting civilians… mass graves… blowing up hospitals and civilian apartments… the demons will pay. They will pay with everything they have, including their freedom.
In part that’s because a Sanders Presidency, if by some miracle he’d won, would likely have been a lame duck presidency from the very beginning. Democrats can’t even unite behind the relatively inoffensive and status quo supporting blandness or Joe Biden - there’s no hope whatsoever that Bernie would have been more successful in my opinion.
Six months ago I would've thought the Dems should start prepping a different candidate, but after a strong showing in the midterms, and the lack of an obvious strong alternative, I think Biden could do well with a second term.

Personally if I was Biden I'd announce like right now "I will not be running for re-election, instead I will use my remaining time as president to do as much good as I possibly can I encourage the DNC to have a strong, robust primary, and I will refrain from being involved in the primary process".

If Biden was stumbling through his presidency, looking overwhelmed by the dynamics of the situations and struggling to do anything, absolutely I'd say he shouldn't run.

But the dude is coming off the most successful two years of any presidency lately, including a semi-successful midterm. He's proven good at his job, so his age isn't much a concern for me.

Biden openly denied the suggestion he would only serve one-term if elected. So, if you're frustrated, that's on you believing something that was never seriously mentioned beyond one Politico article from 2019 that Biden denied anyway.
>He deregulated the airline industry, paving the way for middle-class Americans to fly for the first time in large numbers, and he regulated natural gas, laying the groundwork for our current energy independence. He worked to require seatbelts or airbags, which would go on to save 9,000 American lives each year. He inaugurated the nation’s investment in research on solar energy and was one of the first presidents to warn us about the dangers of climate change.

The historical test is bullshit. If that's the defining test for Constitutionality, then Thomas should have his marriage voided and shouldn't be allowed any sort of power, especially on a court. Women too. Domestic violence would mostly become (legally) a thing of the past. Historically courts were concerned with keeping the nuclear family together, not protecting victims. And I guess that means we can get rid of labor law regarding children too. Oh and safety regulations. You know, maybe this historical precedent thing has got something to it. It could certainly be used against Republicans.
It's really not though. There are other documents from the time that tell us what their thinking was on this matter. They viewed a national standing army as dangerous, but they recognized the need for the fledgling nation to protect itself. I mean, it's literally in the first half. "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State".

How can it both pertain to an unorganized militia and a well operating one? Also, in 2A the militia somehow belongs to the state.

Where does it say owning a gun is tied to being in the militia? IMO it states that a militia is necessary to secure our free state, and because of that, people have the right to own guns.

If militia is necessary: people have the right to own guns. That doesn't imply what you said, that being in the militia give you the right to own a gun.

Is that purely a statement that describes the intent of a militia? Civilians have the right to own guns to be able to own guns to serve in a well-regulated militia? Or, Americans have the right to own guns when serving in a militia? It all comes down to interpretation.
How it should work is the federal government should replace student loans with interest free loans and income based repayments that are forgiven after 10 years if not repaid in full.
Right there… the requirement is the payback of the loan… the student financial assistance program is the program that gives out the loans (i.e., requirement to payback). The summary reading of that law that I provided makes it abundantly clear it’s about waiving the requirements to pay back loans from the student financial assistance programs.

The way it reads to me seems pretty specific to loans (“requirements”) and the student financial assistance programs. I’m looking at the actual law now. You’re right, people can read this and argue over what exactly was meant for each and every potential case, just like any other law. But I don’t think it’s broad… here, see for . To me, that’s pretty specific and seems to fall right in line with the EdSec’s arguments to allow this go forward. I honestly think the only way to attack this is for the Supreme Court to reeeeaaaallly step all over a co-equal branch of the government. This law was introduced in the house, by the power of the purse, and sailed right through the senate without amendments and landed on the presidents desk. COVID has killed more Americans than any attack on our country ever, and all people experienced hardship (and still are). The law was meant for a moment like this, so it would be fed up for the Supreme Court to intervene.

Why are you making shit up and acting correct? The law specifically allows waivers to student financial aid. If you don’t believe me, you can read about it on congress’ website .

Right, would be up to Congress to act in that case. Technically they do have US Marshals, but they are part of Executive Branch even if they take orders from court.
There are alot of Armenians that hold the Kurds just as responsible for the genocide as the Turks. Several massacres committed by Kurds predating the genocide, namely the Hamidian massacre, also didn't help.

Deliberately targeting and killing a particular ethnic group in a country does further the goal of reducing the population of that ethnic group in the country. Both by literally driving down numbers through deaths, and by dissuading other immigrants from coming.

Those are not two mutually exclusive things. You can be aiming to influence political actions by killing people, and the act of killing people can be political in nature if you do it for political reasons.

But that action doesn't further his goal politically, his motivation was to kill brown people, there was no greater political plan or consequence.

Terrorism requires the premeditated action to have a clear agenda and political impact, random violence isn't that.
"AN immense inordinate ambition, the kind of ambition which can take root only in the soul of an oppressed people and be nourished only on the misery of an entire country, is now astir in the hearts of the Russians. This essentially aggressive nation lives in a state of submissiveness so degrading that it seems to be expiating in advance, at home, its expectation of tyranny abroad over other men. The glory and the booty to which it looks forward turn its thoughts away from the shame to which it is being subjected; and in the hope of washing himself clean of his impious sacrifice of public and personal liberty, this kneeling slave fills his dreams with visions of world domination.".
Yes. Think of it as trying to show the breadth of opinions viewers might encounter amongst their family / neighbors / whoever. And with that in mind, note how the dominant core belief never changes - the regime is right, there are more extreme opinions going both ways but we stay the course with the regime, because it is great, we are great, russia is great.

No change, parliamentarians have freedom of speech, there will be fans of Putin in the EP even after this, in fact I suspect they will be quite vocal after the votes and criticising the outcome.

Calls for the EU and its Member States to develop an EU legal framework for the designation of states as sponsors of terrorism and states which use means of terrorism, which would trigger a number of significant restrictive measure against those countries and would have profound restrictive implications for EU relations with those countries; calls on the Council to subsequently consider adding the Russian Federation to such an EU list of state sponsors of terrorism; calls on the EU’s partners to adopt similar measures;.
The problem is that school districts have largely become so sensitive to parent complaints and/or that parents feel so emboldened to harass teachers and administrators such that it becomes impossible for teachers to meaningfully address any sort of controversial topics in their classrooms because the teachers are suddenly put on blast and the school district feels compelled to intervene to put out the fire that conservative activist parents have created.
The article itself is about a deeper problem. Although in very typical NPR fashion they cover it by reciting examples from Side A, then from Side B, then talking to an expert who discusses it in a neutral fashion.

One group of these things is not like the other, but the article definitely points to a problem with experienced teachers being the recipient of politicized complaints.

Knowing teachers, they’re complaining about school board and policy changes as much or more than parents. Ironically it’s the same brainwashed civilians causing both problems.

I’m also not as concerned about that. In the case of Biden winning 24, even if he dies in office that still allows someone else to start gaining steam on the national level for four years.

Thinking towards 2028 though, it's possible it could be better to replace Biden now rather than let the pendulum swing back to the Rs later. I know everyone's saying the incumbency advantage is too good to throw away, but we have 8 year max presidents. They might be better off waiting for the Rs to play their hand before deciding who the best candidate is.

If trump and desantis are going to eat each other alive, it might be an easier win to take advantage of the current divide in the republican party(given there's rarely ever divide there). Take the riskier, but possibly easier, win now and save the incumbency advantage for when there isn't a giant Big Mac stain on their entire party. 4 years of Biden and 8 years of a much more progressive candidate(That without the current divide might not be able to win) is a whole lot better than 8 years of Biden.

And if anyone on the left says they are too new or have too little experience in politics, I'd tell them to just roll with Biden, then. I think if Biden actually made a point to pass the baton to either and support them 100% while Trump and DeSantis are arguing which of them is the bigger sex offender and which can ban the most stuff and execute the most people, they should win.

I'd go with Josh Shapiro or Mark Kelly because they won in important states that need to stay blue and they both seem capable of de-pantsing DeSantis/Trump in a debate...not that debates happen anymore, right?
Guess why? Because of a strong defense alliance, the exact alliance republicans are now trying to dissolve. Had trump won Ukraine would be under Russian control, Moldova would be next and we’d actually have Russia steamrolling it’s way into europe. Republicans have a gift, destroying perfectly fine working American institutions, I wonder why that is? Who puts them up to it and how many rubles do they get (per fuckup).

The third rate military power thing is true, but the steamrolling comment ignores the tactic Russia would likely take. Suppose that Russia marched in and took control of a town on the Polish border. Poland is a NATO member so that would trigger Article 5, but it's just one town. Do we really want to start a major war over one town? Especially if they promise that this is as far as they'll go?

Okay, sure, they took another few miles of territory, but that's mostly an empty area and isn't important. So what if our allies are screaming Article 5 and asking if NATO is really useful at all if it won't do the very thing it was formed to do?
With how successful the Ukrainian special forces have been inside Russia, if they wanted to kill Putin they probably could pull it off. But that doesn’t necessarily end the war. It might make it worse.
Do you honestly not see how it could make it worse lol? Plenty of Russians in high places could start thinking that a nuke is the appropriate response to their glorious leader being killed.

Killing Putin in the Russian mind would mean their views are justified, that they are the real victims of this war and Putin indeed had no choice but to defend against the brutal west.

It doesn't do so, because at the moment Putin at least knows that doing so would mean risking his live as well as there would be a chance the West would respond. (Or it would make the Ukrainians say fuck it, nothing to loose).

Don't get me wrong - I am absolutely not a fan of Putler and him being death would bring me some joy. But Realpolitik means that the circumstances of his demise are important for the faith of Europe in the next 50 years.

The earth's population was 2.85 billion when I was born; I'll be 60 next year. In other words, the world's population has nearly tripled in the last 60 years (2.8x), but even with the green revolution, the amount of arable land, water, minerals, etc has not tripled in that time. We're in for interesting times even if the rate of population growth continues to slow, because it's over a larger base every year...
The earth can support more people if we used resources more wisely, but our population growth is beginning to slow down because we aren’t meeting replacement “goals.”.

Part of the increasing global population is due to increased life expectancy, not just birth rates, and the increase due to life expectancy doesn't compound in the same way.

I don't know if it is a positive or not however you look at it but currently birth rates are in decline in many countries with the median average age increasing.

It's going to be an interesting few decades as so much of the economic growth and lifestyle we have enjoyed is tied to the population increasing (which obviously cannot happen forever). It looks like that M.I.T study of world wide decline in 2040 probably isn't too far off if we keep at it.
Or perhaps, the other poster is correct, and you simply haven't educated yourself to the corruption occurring on both sides when it comes to wall street. Both the Democrat and Republican politicians are fully up for sale and will bend you over without hesitation.
You do realize that not all attacks on Democratic politicians are some sort of tacit support of Republicans right? I have never voted for a Republican in my life... That doesn't make me unable to see the bad shit Democrats do, and there are no shortage of democrats who vote in favor of bill that advance wall street interests at the cost of the public. We aren't talking about one democrat here or there but virtually all of them. Not based on what they say, based on the way they actually vote... when it actually matters.

As for the Hitler tie in. Hitler also drank water. But even still, the belief that all politicians are crooks this belief has had similar well before Hitler in fact, in 1875 address about taxation political corruption and accountability Walter B Pierce gave a whole fucking speech about it. Look it up, its available on google books so piss off with that horseshit.

Additionally, in 1983 Frank Sneep former CIA agent let loose that as part of their training deception about what was being done in a given government proved relatively ineffective as time moved on. What was effective was telling truths that would upset the populace if they got out. Then applying pressure to hide those truths on one end, and expose those truths at another, because after a little bit of work the entire system starts working for you and even in nations with dictatorial control would fall by virtue of the system eating itself... I don't think the KGB and FSB didn't take note of that. So you get to make a choice, is the bad stuff that happens that was revealed at the hands of Russia bad, or does it suddenly become good because "the enemy" exposed it?

Who said something has no baring on how true or untrue a statement is. Who advances a statement does not have bearing on how true or untrue it is. It can only give you indicators that it might be untrustworthy by virtue of who those people are and what lies they may or may not have told in the past. A liar can tell a truth and a truth teller can tell a lie. Either telling the truth is easy, and evidence will bear it out, telling a lie is hard because you constantly have to massage the lie to keep up the ruse.

Every conspiracy that sticks around at all has some kernel of truth to it. In this case, America has a brutal and long history of white supremacy, racism, genocide, and imperialism. I don't think "the founding fathers intended all of this" would necessarily be accurate, but it certainly was all of those things from the start. What makes a person a Nazi or fascist is not recognizing those characteristics, but declaring them to be 'good.'.

There's also a big sampling bias. The idea that "Police-submitted request to the ATF" is a direct corollary to the rate at which ghost guns are used in crimes is a rather large leap. It's as much about whether police bother submitting the trace to the ATF as it is their actual use.
There is an implication in the media that "ghost guns" are always 3D-printed or CNC'ed home-built guns. However, my understanding is that they are simply any gun without a serial number, including normally manufactured guns that had the serial number filed off.

I have not heard the term being applied to regular guns with filed/altered serial numbers. Ghost guns don't have a serial number, but it doesn't seem to apply to guns which had their serial number removed (that may change if we allow serial numbers to be removed). Where are you seeing that these are included in ghost gun statistics?

Ghost guns ARE useful however in one area- all gun shops are required to keep sales records for life. If some racist redneck militia (or a staff member working at a gun shop of one) gets their hands on that, they have a pretty good idea of who has guns in an area. When that record doesn’t exist locally, such as with a “ghost” gun, that’s one less gun that an unlawful militia can find out about in case they actually decide to try and start a civil war.
Sorry bud, if a party defines itself around people who cheerlead for terrorism, then anybody voting for them is a terrorist sympathizer. The word for an "apolitical" German in 1938 is "Nazi".
The trend I’ve been seeing is that anyone who voted conservatively is a Nazi, or Nazi sympathizer, etc. I get it, there are shitty people who vote Republican. The problem is change can be a slow moving process. It’s gonna take a while for people to become more accepting of other peoples lifestyles. It’s not gonna happen overnight, and I just wish more people would understand that.

I mean, politics aside, Russia was a top tourist destination. Not much to see in Qatar apart from desert. It’s also close to Europe, so it’s much easier for Europeans to travel to.
shows that Brazil had 6.4M in 2019 vs Russia’s 24.4. Russia received four times the tourists Brazil received, so no Russia is more popular. But that could also be attributed to its close proximity to Europe (Europeans get lots of paid holidays and have higher GDP per capita so they can easily afford traveling overseas).

But here’s the deal, China doesn’t care about Taiwan itself or its people enough to risk such a difficult operation. It’s more about the semiconductor factories, so “destroy it and leave it in ashes” is the opposite of what China wants. Oh and did I mention that these factories require people with very niche knowledge? Like “only the Taiwanese person who has been working on this factory for the past 20 years knows how to do it” niche knowledge. So not only do they need to capture the island which is hard as is, they should do it in a way that won’t damage the factories and won’t endanger civilians.
Oh I am not saying I am an expert, I am just a dude who read a bunch of articles, don’t get me wrong, but with that being said I don’t think it’s fair to assess my understanding of the situation based on a 5 sentence answer to a comment that mentions that China can simply blow everything up. If you read my next comment you will see me presenting the opposite case arguing why it might invade Taiwan. And to be clear since my comments kinda contradict each other, I don’t think China will invade Taiwan, but I don’t rule out such a possibility.

On paper China does have the overwhelming advantage in air and naval power like the allies did, but it’ll be almost impossible to neutralize all of Taiwan’s anti ship missiles.

In such a scenario the US and it's allies destroy China's missile forces and then massacre any Chinese landing ship that even dares to put out to sea.

Colleges are already under a lot of pressure to keep costs down as low as possible because they are competing against other schools for enrollment. Net tuition costs have basically been flat the past decade.
So if the rates have been flat and stay flat then there would be no issue on that end going forward. I’m the solution I gave, the schools could still change whatever they want. But if the government only gave a max amount like I mentioned and if private lenders didn’t stand to make as much and/or would have a massive amount of risk for a borrower defaulting, then students wouldn’t have access to as much money. Unless the students and/or parents already had money.

If a school wanted to charge $100K for a degree, but the government only gave $25K then the student would either have to come up with the other $75K or not go. It’d be that simple. If the school could operate like normal if student s decided to not go because of the price then there’s no issue in that case. But if the school couldn’t afford that and would possibly fail because of it, their options would be either to lower their prices and/or shutdown.

If it was a hobby balloon like is suspected, it was likely vaporized (colloquial speaking), stuff can drift for long distances, and we do NOT understand the science well enough to predict debris fall with that much accuracy, and a long history of losing debris from downed air traffic, regardless of how, why, where, or when it's downed.

There's also the expense of looking for it, and what real motivation to hide it? Either it was a civilian balloon, or a Spy Balloon (possibly from China), confirming either will not do any harm to either administration (US or Canada's) at this point.

The US government also ran multiple flybys and observed the object for 14 hours before shooting it down period I'm pretty sure they would be able to discern if it was a balloon in that time.

It’s when Israel annexes parts of the West Bank where Palestinians used to live and then bans the Palestinians from going there any more. It’s a slow land-grab/ethnic cleansing.
Just because there weren’t houses in a particular spot doesn’t mean it was useless to the Palestinians. Vast swathes of the US are uninhabited, does that mean some other country could come and annex them, then forbid Americans from going there any more?

You’re disgusting. How do you defend Palestinians living in an area and then being driven off of it and not allowed to return? This has nothing to do with individual renters or individual buildings. Israel takes the land and then only allows Israelis to live there from then on.

A settlement is any Israeli city, town, or any other place where Israelis live outside of "the green line".

Here is an example of one settlement: Jewish neighbourhoods of Hebron. Jews lived in Hebron for over 3000 years. After massacres of Palestinian Jews by Palestinian Arabs in 1920 and 1929, most Jews fled Hebron. Last Jew left Hebron in face on invading Jordan forces in 1948. Once Jordan was kicked out in 1967, Jews started returning to the buildings that they never sold and remained in Jewish ownership all along. Neighbourhoods of such Jews in Hebron are called settlements.

Also discussing of forcing ethnicities out, what happened to Bethlehem and Hebron which had large Jewish population? It's like Arabs just decided to start murdering Jews and forcing them to move. And now Jews in any of those areas will get murdered or stoned. Not to mention the Arab side of Jerusalem.

Keep in mind Arabs weren't called Palestians at any point of history. For this reason between wars independence war and the 6 days, most propaganda slogans used by Arab nations attacking Israel were "Destroy Palestine, kill Zionism" . Only after 1960's were current Arabs called Palestians. They (Palestians) won't even call the Arabs living in Israel Palestians, rather by their tribes (Druze, Beduim, Egyptian, Syrian and Marrocan). Despite some being on the land as long as the group you call Palestians if not longer.
The US already spends more per capita on healthcare than a number of countries with better systems. The problem is that a lot of this money ends up in the pockets of shareholders, and isn't used to actually improve public health. There is enough money to give the American people much better healthcare than they currently have without reducing the defence budget.
When will you understand that the military budget is not the reason you don't have healthcare? You are already paying twice as much as the next most expensive country and getting jack shit for it. It's the multibillion dollar insurance corporations and for profit hospitals who are fucking you.

Your analysis is HIGHLY biased in favor of insurance companies, because virtually every penny of cost they incur that isn't a payment directly to point of care services is largely useless.

I'm talking about insurance company employees that basically figure out how to deny treatments, pay out less to providers and keep more for themselves, drop costly patients from plans and recruit healthy patients that pay premiums but don't consume as much care, not to mention sales, marketing and advertising to recruit people to particular plans that bear almost no relation to actual quality of care.
Come on dude, no one takes you seriously outside of the US. Blocking roads is somewhat terroristic but blowing someone's face of for being on "your" lawn or you feeling threatened is just your God given right? .

The overall renewable share of energy, i.e including fuels, is still super mediocre at 15% or so. So enough reason to protest.

This is simply not how the law works, protests are not a favour to be granted at a specific place. Instead, the starting point is the protestor’s choice where and how to protest and that the government must do their very best to facilitate this. Restrictions and bans can only be instituted for a handful of specific reasons and must a applied as sparingly as possible.

The government may impose restrictions for a handful of reasons, but only ever the least possible to alleviate them.
The virus doesn't play this way. With an insanely contagious variant like omicron (R number of 18) when you relax the rules you get an explosion in cases, not a slow re-opening. China knows this science.
Not true, I was a huge critic of zero covid and lockdowns when they were a thing. Now that China made the right decision I'm in favor because I want to travel.

Also there is no such thing as a "progressive opening" when it comes to omicron. Name one country that did so. All of them went through what China is going through now to some extent, just look at the US last year this time. It's because of the population in China and the lack of immunity at present which is why the surge is much bigger than other countries when they had their omicron outbreaks.

China knows the science and yet they don't have hospitals ready, are out of many medicines, and did a complete reopening rather than progressive opening knowing omicron is very contagious?

China went from one extreme to another extreme. They went from zero-covid for far too long then opened up quickly without being prepare. Seems that for the past 3 years Xi never made any plans for when he would re-open China and then under pressure from protests and from the business community, instead of a slow re-opening like many other countries in that region, Xi just opened the flood gates without having the hospitals ready, the medication, etc. I wouldn't be surprise if he did it as punishment to the people.
I remember when I first started following politics in like 2004, the 4th circuit more than the 5th was considered the most conservative - to the point it was absolutely draconian.
I just went and looked at the current composition of the court. 7 liberal appointees to 6 conservative appointees (I'm counting the circuit judges only and not those on senior status).

Personally I disagree him I thought Amy appointment was fine, not that I am a fan of her but republicans controlled the senate and POTUS and her nomination was fair game. My issue was with Merick Garland being ignored by republican controlled senate so they could add Gorsuch.

On any topic relating to the U.S. - Canada relationship it is common for some Canadian people go on about "closest ally," "shared boarder," "largest trading partner," etc to prove whatever point they are trying to make. They seem to be emotionally attached which is causing them to read too much into any topic relating to the U.S. and Canada relationship. It is bothering that specific group of Canadians that Biden didn't visit Canada first.
I really don't think Biden and his team of advisors and the entire whitehouse staff forgot it's tradition to visit Canada first. Hmmmm I wonder if something happened the last couple years that might have had Biden's team want to curtail unnecessary travel... especially during his first year in office when the pandemic was still more of a top of mind concern.

It's far more likely the pandemic played a roll than some sort of institutional memory issue, it's not like our geopolitical interests were rapidly diverging and he needed to shore up a shaky ally, we're still up here. Biden was VP when Obama visited, he's been here before and probably figured why risk it at the time.

I feel like you're just way overthinking it and looking past the most likely explanation, the pandemic derailed his travel plans and this was the first time it got slotted it. The most obvious explanation is usually correct and "oh ya COVID was much more of a thing then, probably delayed the trip" is far more likely than some institutional memory issue.

I'm not saying it's some super important thing the Whitehouse is uber passionate about but 40 years until Trump is a pretty good run. I bet some of the same team that was with Obama is with Biden, nobody magically forget, their entire job is not to forget things like that.

As per another comment - it really doesn't bother me that Biden is going elsewhere first. Or really anyone I know. It would however bother quite a lot of people if he DIDNT visit Canada at all during his term. Whether intentional or not, that would send a really negative message to a very close ally & partner.
We are not closing farms to 'comply with EU rules'. This is just framing. We are cloaing farms because the biodiversity in our nature reserves is getting destroyed by NOx.
This is fundamentally about forcing farmers to not pollute/destroy land not belonging to them while they grow stuff.

Read some news, Germany has said multiple times they have not received any request from Poland or any other country for that matter for export licenses for their leopards so your statement just has nothing to do with reality.
As I stated above Germany/Scholz have stated multiple times that the only way the will send tanks to Ukraine is if other countries do so first.

Russia invading Finland with cross the line and the US would just send them billions upon billions of dollars worth of cutting edge weapons. Don’t forget that the Russians have largely exhausted their supply of tanks made before 1970.

Tanks seem like a liability because the Russians abandon their own tank doctrine in favor of acting like idiots. We’ve known since World War I that a tank on its own is an easy target, tanks supported by infantry and air can be useful. Russian military instead sends tanks out with no dismounted infantry and often without air. If you don’t have boots on the ground along with the tanks there’s little to no threat to enemy infantry armed with antitank weapons by javelins and rocket propelled grenades. Yes tanks have lost some utility due to the use of inexpensive antitank weapons and drones. But Russian military doctor and it is extra stupid so we’re not learning that much.
What you say is fine, but sonnytron is implying opposing politicians should be criminalized for disagreeing with sonnytron's POV. Sounds very authoritarian.

Sure, merits. What a surprise, every Republican on the bench thought that Congress can't levy a tax when a Democrat is in charge, and every Democrat thought Congress has the right to levy taxes. On Roe v Wade, yet another surprise! Republicans thought half a century of precedent was wrong (and lied to the Senate about these views), and Dems thought otherwise.

Ironic how Republicans have been trying to cover this for years but keep saying Democrats are the ones covering things up? I understand why, it just makes me upset how jarring the hypocrisy is.
I mean it's a matter of political expedience. Gun control is always going to be secondary to societal reform, because fixing inequity within society drastically cuts down on gun violence anyway. Countries like Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland all succeed in having high gun ownership rates and baseline gun violence rates, mostly because they have functioning social systems. Their common sense approach to gun control and universal or near universal conscription helps-their citizens are highly likely to know basic gun safety.
Now let's consider from another perspective-how many people have and carry guns. We instantly get some strong reason to be skeptical of Kleck's numbers here; 32% of the USA population owns a gun. There are somewhere between 7-8 million crimes in the USA each year. Let's assume that gun owners aren't magnetically attracted to crimes. In order for that 2.5 million number to be right, gun owners, when the victims of a crime, have to have used their guns almost 100% of the time.

C. The number of people who carry guns daily given the number of crimes that occur outside of the home.
For even more reason to be skeptical, only about 5% of people carry their guns every day. Unless those 8 million crimes are all occurring while the victim is home, the chances of having the gun are even less likely.

Hence gun owners are even less likely to be involved with crimes, because most crimes are simply not occurring where they are to begin with, and they aren't likely to have their guns when the crimes do occur.

This is a pretty biased take, it seems highly plausible that those people living in areas of higher crime might be more inclined to get a gun for defensive purposes in the first place.

I would have thought defensive use would be something they could spin like "look there's so much crime that instances of people having to defend themselves with a firearm have gone up and it's great that people are defending themselves." But I guess anything that shows gun violence is bad in their minds, even if was defense.

This was made righter after 2013 after Obama's executive action to look into gun violence. Note that the CDC never really did anything with this because they didn't get any funding to actually do anything.

I've seen those as they very slowly sneak up to their target, but imagin a fast moving drone coming as a surprise attack like a flying soldier - should be tested at least.

My guess is the return drones they send on multiple missions are probably better for probing attacks and front-line support (You expect it to break fairly rapidly anyway). The suicide drones are probably going to be more for back line disruption or Emergency support to a unit that needs it.

i think the difference is the grenade droppers are larger quad copters hovering in place while the suicide drones are more a model airplane coming in fast and boom. smaller faster targets.

They rarely do anymore, but they probably will start forcing people coming from China to do all of the things they where doing in lock down and even make them get the vaccine if they font have one or force them to get back on planes and ho back to China.
Would the Chinese even accept shipments of the mRNA vaccines for its citizens even if it could save 10s of thousands or would they stand on nationalistic principle and refuse?

The ineffectivity of Sinovac has been so overhyped. It still prevents death to nearly the same degree as MRNAs do, it's just not as good at preventing symptoms, or halting spread.

Chinese vaccine does what it's supposed to, it's just not as effective at stopping mild symptoms, or disease spread. The brain drain is definitely accurate though.
and for a good reason, the role of control and regulation falls on the state, and failure to act in face of irregularities is a failure of the state, not a failure in protecting individual action.
protecting individual action is either unrealizable because the name of the whistleblower will be out there and discrimination is very hard to prove, or will lead to even worse ideas like being able to report wrongdoing anonymously, opening the door to all kind of malfeasance.

The problem is that there's no clear definition of who counts as a whistleblower and how to protect them against legal action from their employer (which could also be the government). The law was written with Snowden in mind, not some guy at VW who notices his company cheating emissions tests. There's also no clear way for whistleblowers to get their information out without breaking other laws (like data privacy or treason). And last but not least: companies can still fire you for being a whistleblower if they want to - it just has to go through an arbitration process first. Which means you'll lose your job either way unless you have enough money saved up for a lawyer.

So yeah, we're working on it but it's gonna take time because this shit is complicated af and needs careful consideration before passing any new law here. Meanwhile our economy is suffering because investors don't trust us anymore after Dieselgate and nobody wants to build factories here.

I'm from Germany and I have no idea what the EU is talking about. Whistleblower protection laws were passed in 2017, but they are so bad that even the government had to admit it can't be implemented as intended. So we're working on a new draft right now, which should be ready by next year.

I believe it certainly wasn't an ideal trade, but it is definitely being exploited by various groups for political aims. Most people are content seeing the interpretation that they agree with and ignoring facts that contradict that, and the Biden administration really isn't good at optics and fully explaining the situation.

He was arrested in 2018, when Trump was president, and could have easily been swapped for Maria Butina, a Russian spy. In fact, there was speculation that he was grabbed as a bargaining chip to secure her release. Instead, Butina got a slap on the wrist and was given back to Russia in exchange for basically nothing.
I honestly think what Congress may do one day is pass a federal right to abortion in the first trimester (or X number of weeks) and then let states decide beyond that. But before that happens, we're going to have to hear/see all sorts of cases where women and girls die needlessly.

I don't think people who vote GOP are doing it in spite of the insurrection. They're doing it because they think the insurrection was justified. Conservative media pushes the big lie narrative nonstop and completely ignores the 60+ court cases all over the country that the GOP lost due to lack of evidence when they challenged the 2020 election results. They're just living in a completely different paradigm with a completely different source of information.

Somewhat more seriously, in the past decade we've seen a lot of problems with countries that try to go it on their own, Brexit created a lot of problems, Trump created a lot of problems, Russia is politically isolated while everyone has Ukraine's back, the importance of NATO has been clearly demonstrated.... Like, these things go in cycles, obviously, and it would be dumb of me to presume that this cycle is finished (can cycles be "finished?") but I do still see some signs for hope.
And before you ask, no, I don't like it when the United States does it either. Still, an imperfect return to Brexit is better than being out in the cold, I can both like the idea of Britain rejoining the EU and wish they would get the full fat version.

You also forget that when the UK was finally allowed in the situation was different, now the bloc has more people and more economic power, the UK has like for Brexit, no leverage.

I'm not saying the UK should get any special treatment next time, just saying why there's still a reason the EU would consider giving the UK exemptions.

If China wasn't actively threatening and provoking all of its neighbors they wouldn't be so united against it. "China is for actual defense" is a joke.
FFS, I dismiss the 1950s and you bring up the Monroe Doctrine from 140 years earlier? Your defense of China seems to rely very heavily on ignoring the last 50 years worth of events.

You might want to read up into what China is doing in the South China Sea and the nine-dash line because you're missing quite a bit of information. And ignoring that the only reason that North Korea is flinging nuclear-capable missiles over South Korea and Japan is Chinese funding. Those are clearly provocative and threatening actions and even all that ignores the wolf-warrior diplomatic core.

We all realize that. Unfortunately Taiwan becoming a territory of either side is an existential threat to the other, so if either side goes in the other must.

Only "neighbor" China threatens is Taiwan which US and China agree is part of China since 1949 when US installed Chiang regime in Taiwan and planned to use it for invasion of China while claiming Taiwan was the official government of all China.

But China is defending against US which has waged war on China via proxy Taiwan since Chinese independence in 1949.

Because he’s not actually serious about term limits. The bill is posturing for votes. He knows the GOP base is too stupid to understand the contradiction, and he also knows the bill itself has zero chance of passing.
I do think he might even be intentionally weaponizing the fact that he's universally loathed to forward term limits, because it tends to be Republicans who want them.

You don't play by the rules of the system you wish we had, you play by the ones we've got right now. Ironically Cruz is probably generating a lot of support for term limits by running again.

For term limits, it really depends on why Cruz supports them to decide if this is simply rank hypocrisy. Does he feel that nobody should serve long as a matter of principle? Or does he believe that long serving senators are more beholden to powerful interests, and the system would be improved by imposing term limits, but not by individual senators choosing to retire?

Not OP, but I'm afraid term limits would lead to more people getting themselves elected in order to do corporate bidding and get rewarded with a cushy job after their time in the Senate is up. I mean, even more than they do now.

I also suspect no one really knows what they are doing when they first begin, and term limits might get rid of them at the exact point a Congressperson hits their stride and learns to get shit done. Especially for Reps, with their 2-year terms.
1) Russia doesn't have that kind of influence in Serbia. Serbia is somewhere in the middle between EU and let's call them "eastern powers" ( Russia and China ). Now EU has been applying a little pressure onto Serbia to sanction Russia over Ukraine which Serbia is reluctant to do as it still depends on Russia for a couple things, namely the UNSC veto and gas, but Russia is in no position to make any demands as that would push Serbia further to the EU side, so they have been threading carefully there.
1. Kosovo passes the license plate law requiring holders of Serbian license plates to obtain temporary Kosovo plates when entering Kosovo.

A bit wrong here with step 1 in your chain of events, it wasn't Serbs entering Kosovo that needed temporary license plates issued by Kosovo, it was ethnic Serbians living in Kosovo using plates issued by Serbia. They were being asked to use Kosovo plates.

Kosovo story is quite complex. It cannot be compared to Ukraine. Kosovo was (is?) a part of Serbia. It was an autonomous region. Do they have "the right" to a separation? Eh, difficult to tell. The constitution of Yugoslavia was as awful as possible, granting everyone the right to "self-determination" (choosing freely your own destiny), but at the same time adding "with the consent of EVERYONE ELSE", which is bonkers. Like saying, the law gives you freedom to do literally anything - for as long as everyone in the town agrees. That's not how laws (and logic) work.
It's not like they are getting royally shafted here though, what passed was the agreement that was accepted by all 12 union leaders initially, and was accepted by the members of 8 of the unions.
The very same unions that agreed to let congress arbitrate and adhere to what they came up with, even if that meant the compromise option 52% of them weren't in favor of because it didn't go far enough.

You want to know how to make shit like this better in the future? Actually vote in more of the people who actually voted in favor of this, rather than blaming them for it not passing through the senate, with 50 GOP Senators waiting to filibuster the shit out of anything good for the country. But sure, keep blaming the dems for the GOP shooting you in the foot.

Except that we expect Republicans to do evil shit. Not much we can do about that just yet. We equally expect Dems not to side with them on this sort of bill. Or at least, I sure as hell hope we're holding them to a higher standard than the would-be-fascist/theocracy party.
I appreciate your respect of the people, and your love of your background. Just from a Jewish perspective being Jewish is binary, you are or you aren't.
Judaism isn't measured by blood quanta. That's a strange thing foisted on us by Nazi and white supremacy ideology.

Except he wasn't a "literal Nazi." Not defending her or saying she's not lying or whatever else. But it's important to make a distinction between people who actually were members of the Nazi party and the vast majority of German citizens who, while not blameless, also were not actually members of the Nazi party.

They are saying it is an interesting shift from being a literal Nazi a member of the armed forces of Nazi Germany, to raising your son to be Jewish, especially since other family members say that her father was not Jewish.

The point still stands is if her grandfather was in the wehrmacht, it is near impossible he was Jewish, and highly unlikely he raised his son as Jewish.

Definitely not controversial to have a grandfather who served in the military during the Nazi regime, unless of course you pretend to be Jewish while running for public office.
Everything in Canada is either a monopoly or an oligopoly. We're apparently allergic to competition. That's why we have the highest internet and cell phone bills in the world.
Phone and Internet costs when I lived I Canada were absurd. Like $50+ for 2-4 GB (which by the looks of it has at least go d up to 20-30).

Good to see from their other psot that data coverages are gone though. I once binged some Netflix and youtube sick in bed, had the WiFi connected but forgot to turn mobile data off so it went for that because reasons I guess, and wound up getting charged about $80 extra on the back of that alone.

Even the same tub of liberte Yoghurt made and packaged in quebec, after being transported across an entire ocean, costs considerably less here than over there.

And charging more for higher fat milk was just hilarious on so many levels. It stopped getting funny when a 500g tub of feta was like $12 and a pint of double cream something like $9 (rough figures admittedly, going in memory here).
I hope every last one of the journalists using a war with very real dead people and the world at stake to generate more clicks and get more revenue gets publicly shunned. Absolutely vile.
Nice title there, Newsweek. Also they got him drunk on the podcast and started asking loaded questions, then used the answers to make a nice clickbaity title and this is the result. He said that filming prisoners of war Is in violation of international law - this turned into "Trainer says the Ukrainian army is committing attocities".

I find this very interesting tho; a media source (a shit one, sure) reports on an American who saw the war first hand who acknowledged that Ukraine is committing war crimes, and you people are mad at the media source?

I’ve read the whole article. Given that he issued a statement about it and didn’t explicitly say it was false, I believe it’s true. At the very least I believe he believes it is true. Ukraine is executing soldiers who surrendered. They are mistreating prisoners of war.
In Iraq one Challenger 2 had its drivers sight damaged and threw a track, according to wikipedia "It was hit by 14 rocket-propelled-grenades from close range and a MILAN anti-tank missile. The crew survived, safe within the tank until it was recovered for repairs, the worst damage being to the sighting system. It was back in operation six hours later. According to British army, one Challenger 2 operating near Basra survived being hit by 70 RPGs in another incident".
How much of an issue is it that it may not hold up against the very newest anti tank capabilities, when so much of what the Russians are fielding is ageing Soviet hardware?

I wouldn't totally rule out that Russia would supply some personnel with more up-to-date equipment to defeat western tanks, should we see these tanks end up in Ukraine. We know they have better stuff than what they're fielding, but, somebody in Russia clearly doesn't see the point in bringing out what few new toys they have yet.

It shouldn't make a whole lot of difference against the equipment we're seeing Russia field in Ukraine. I think it was even mentioned that they're not even providing tank crews with their most up-to-date APFSDS and sticking to older types.

Also those tanks not being modernised may be useful for spare parts for the ones that have been modernised.
They appear to be a failed state already. Take away the rocket, and now ICBM attacks and I’m just not sure it’s anything other than shoddy or unbelievable saber rattling.
IMO that's because our doctrine no longer relies on artillery; we simply bomb that shit to oblivion from the air. I don't know of a single country that can match the US in air power, not even close. The in the world based on TrueValueRating (not just number of aircraft) are, in order:

IMO, the US doesn't need to change tactics because its doctrine is already far superior to that of countries like Russia, who still rely on infantry and artillery. I can't imagine any conflict the US would get into in which we would even need a huge ground assault force, because we have so many other options before we even get to that point.

In a full scale conflict “just call an F-16” can’t be the solution to all tactical problems, there won’t be enough to go around.

Which is something that is possible in the sort of small wars we’ve been fighting, against enemies with no air power or air defense of their own.

The US also hasn't been against any enemy that has extremely good air defense. Russia theoretically does simply by number of S300 and S400 systems. As does china. Which is why you see US AirPower have two distinct forms nowadays: long range stealth aircraft and new surgical CAS systems. With the logic, similar to the gulf war, of using the long range stealth bombers in combination with cruise missiles to take out those anti air capabilities.

Yeah, from my limited research our new generation bombers and fighters have weapons capable of destroying most anti air defenses before the enemy can actually lock on. They may be able to detect but can't do much before we are able to fire our missiles.
COVID vaccines do wear out over time, but even then, their main purpose is to make getting sick much less lethal.
Also, over 95% of the population is vaccinated so many of those who catch COVID generally have less severe symptoms. When I got it I just had a slight headache and a runny nose.

I'm sure if it was worse we'd still be living under various health restrictions. Yet, they've just about all been lifted. Even healthcare and childcare workers can work without masks these days and it's no longer a requirement to isolate if you have a positive test. So we either don't care anymore or it's not bad enough to warrant the many health restrictions that were once implemented to control the spread of the disease.

Last I heard it was Omicron. A quick google search suggests that XBB is a subvariant of Omicron. Omicron is statistically far less severe than the Delta strain and I recall reading a study that suggests its no worse than the common flu in terms of symptoms and the only thing it really has over the flu is that it spreads far more easily which, inevitably, results in far more people actually getting sick.

After a British gunman killed 16 people in 1987, the country banned semiautomatic weapons like the ones he had used. It did the same with most handguns after a school shooting in 1996. It now has one of the lowest gun-related death rates in the developed world.

Legislation is one way to push back, even if the legislation doesn't pass or gets overturned. It forces the corrupt to put their corruption on display. Not pushing back while waiting for the political landscape to change is exactly what the gun fetishists would love to see.

But with the current state of things, the public does not support strict gun control, and the political power does not exist to pass wide spread gun control legislation.

Once you have a large majority, if the culture of the country has shifted that gun control is feasible then you can pass gun control. Because you have the political power to do so and the public genuinely supports the legislation.
State Rep. Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, filed House Bill 714 and House Joint Resolution 50 last week that would create a new “District of Austin” to replace Texas’ capital.
So they want to take away all elected officials of one of the biggest citys in Tx so they can control it with people who are elected by people who dont live there, essentially taking away and voting power the people of Austin have.

Almost every single Republican who gets elected to state office drafts a go-nowhere bill like this that proposes some dipshit tactic to stick it to The People’s Republic of Austin. It’s like an initiation stunt for the Texas GOP.

I am worried, however, that her independent candidacy will hurt the Democratic candidate more than the Republican candidate in Arizona. Keeping the Senate in 2024 was already going to be tough for Democrats, and this makes it tougher. But I still don't see what they were supposed to do about it.
Nothing has changed. Sinema is going to continue to vote the way she's always voted, which means the Democrats will still be able to continue investigating Trump and appoint judges and do all the other things 51 Senators allows them to do.

This is really about skipping the Democratic primary in two years when she runs for re-election. She knew she would lose it, so if she wants to run again, as evidently she does, she'll have to do it as an independent and hope for a plurality in a three-way election.

She’s switching because she will lose in the primary and now that there’s 51, she’s not as necessary in the caucus. I’m not sure how many votes she can pull in and how lousy of a candidate Rs put up will be significant.
Defense ties between the two run deep. It's worth noting that despite the fact that Azerbaijan is Shi'ite majority, like Iran, it is closer in nearly every single sense to Turkey, which would mean it has no problem aligning itself with Israel.
I hope that countries like Azerbaijan work to have a genuine, warm, constructive peace with Israel, and then work with other Muslim countries to organize an intervention and to try to get both ultra nationalist Israelis and ultra nationalists Palestinians to calm down.

Deep down, they all know that dealing with Hamas and Iran/Hezbollah is a nightmare.

He gets publicity because he’s a great leader trying to keep his country alive against a tyrant. Person of the year isn’t always a good thing. It’s just whoever made the most headlines that year. Hitler, Stalin, and even Bin Laden were all Person’s of the Year. I can’t see anything off with a man going to every measure to protect the country he loves. He either gets what he needs, or the entire country dies.
This is like a remote town with nothing in it. I didn’t realize how far Ukraine has pushed back until I looked this up on a map. Wow. Good job Russia. That’s the first win for Russia I’ve heard in a long time, and it’s a sad win.
Its also pretty sad how even with western support the Russians are still in Ukraine and taking ground.

Nearly no progress has been made in 2 months now, a lot of people on this site vastly underestimate how many men Putin can throw at this and hold on. The longer this goes on the more financial pain at home there will be which will only lower support in the future, we need to get this over with as quickly as possible before people stop caring.

I dont believe we even have the purely defensive patriot AA system sent yet, its an embarrasment on how much we're dragging our feet. The tanks we're sending are being sent in the 10's, we should be sending them in the 100's. The longer this drags out the more Ukrainian lives will be lost.

Soledar is to the north of Bakhmut so it’s a massive loss for the Ukrainians fighting in the stronghold. Supplies from the north are all but cut off now, and the Russians are one step closer to encircling the city.
You can boil everything down to it's basic roots. Pretending that culture isn't important is really, really dumb. If culture doesn't matter then we are less than human.
I’m not saying culture isn’t important, I’m just saying we’ve evolved past the use of traditions that don’t serve a purpose. It’s not like I’m saying that names don’t have origins, just that those origins don’t prevent usage outside of one’s gender. I don’t buy the argument that a gendered name allows for the listener to know a persons gender because there are plenty traditionally gender neutral names and it’s never an issue. That’s why we have pronouns.

Yes I understand that, and I’m saying there’s no reason to adhere to those associations when they are now obsolete. What we consider to be current “gender neutral names” proves my point.

Names are just specific sounds we assign to people, there’s no rule that says certain names HAVE to be male or female, just like clothing. I’ve met female Michaels and male Leslies, it’s uncommon sure but honestly it’s kind of silly that we assign gender to names.

You're just misunderstanding what people mean by "male names" and "female names". They're not saying that there is some universal rule that determines whether a name is male or female. They are saying that those names are associated with men or women in the culture that is being talked about.
Nancy Pelosi should work on expelling any insurrectionist members from the house during the lame duck session. And if that is how the Republicans lose their expected house majority, she would be completely justified in bringing that hammer down.
There's probably at least one swing district Republican who could be convinced to flip, especially if their caucus collapses into chaos to the point where it'd be impossible to get reelected as a Republican.

I suppose such a Republican would be losing a lot of support from their party, but at least a few Republicans were elected from Democratic-leaning districts and could make a name for themselves as a moderate bipartisan House Speaker.

Republicans appear favored to win a narrow majority in the House, which would make McCarthy the front-runner for Speaker, but Pelosi suggested to co-anchor Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” that McCarthy might not secure the needed votes from his caucus.

“Why would I make a judgment about something that may or may not ever happen?” Pelosi asked. “No, I don’t think he has it. But that’s up to his own people to make a decision as to how they want to be led or otherwise.”.
I don't see this happening. Syria is exhausted and divided. Iraq is divided and Iran is boiling. Best they can do is for some of them to give Türkiye a blank check to do what it wants and maybe some help, but 3 of those 4 countries are way too in over their own heads with fuck ton of other shit to be doing any warring against the Kurds at this point.
I don't trust this news at all, at least not until some other sources confirm it, however, even if it is true, I can only see it going one of two ways: They talk big game but it all falls apart later on and status quo continues . Or, Turkish troops withdraw and maybe provide some military assets to Syria to get them to do the fighting and Syrian regime botches it, either intentionally or through sheer incompetence.

An added benefit is the that Syrian regime would attempt to wipe the "rebels" out, instead of Turkiye who eventually would be stuck with an armed insurgency. They can later step in as heroes and get public support if the regime can't recapture it.

Keep this in mind. Nothing is set in stone yet. We have no insight to this meeting. Even if this report is verified later, the reality usually change within a week.

That's a security risk in a much weaker state if they are serious about annexing parts of northern Syria later on.

He's leaving the North west, not north east. Judging from the understanding mentioned in the article it seems Turkiye and the Syrian regime will target Kurdish militia together with Russian backing.
You should have seen our other amendment on the ballot that would allow the state legislature to call itself into session whenever it wanted. It was the size of a fucking CVS receipt on our ballot. There is a disparity of hundreds of thousands of votes between it and this abortion amendment where people didn't even bother.
I definitely lean on Ballotpedia a lot (and honestly find it baffling and a red flag when candidates aren't themselves utilizing it). I also know I am not in the majority of people that don't stay informed throughout the whole process ahead of elections.

I feel like ballot measures should also put a moratorium on the issue being brought back up. I feel like they're gonna keep trying to ban abortion anyways despite the people clearly speaking.

I'm still convinced that the GOP has miscalculated: there is FAR less enthusiasm for abortion-bans, even among republicans, than they think there is.

The crazies might have demanded results, but my point is that they - or at least a much greater number of them than the GOP thinks - didn't and don't actually want this result. They just say they do, because that has become the thing you do to show how Christian you are. Only a lot of them don't actually mean it. They just want to fit in. "We are the tribe that hates abortion Grrrrr Here's me really hating abortion" But what they actually mean when they say this is "I want to be one of the tribe" They're not actually talking about abortion when they do this. They're talking about tribal affiliation.
We were never one nation. The north and the south, generally speaking, had alien cultural values in 1800, they had alien cultural values in 1900, and they have alien cultural values in 2023. (TBF however. what is the "south" and the "north" has moved around over the past 200 years; rural Oregon is north AF and has southern cultural values, while San Diego is on the Mexican border and has northern cultural values.).
enough is enough. California has had 6 mass shootings this year and it isn't even February yet. Fuck your gun freedumbz, we need strict gun control NOW.

We agree on one thing, Federal gun laws need to be enforced. But the interesting thing is that enforcing the existing laws would be more effective than adding to them. In addition, creating new laws won’t magically convince the ATF to enforce laws against shady gun store owners that it already refuses to enforce.

I don't think it was mandatory, but the restrictions on gun ownership meant most wouldn't qualify without applying separately.

It seems in the US you lot are just fine with the mass shootings. Just as long as your guns stay with you, that's clearly non-negotiable.
As an Arab American and also an atheist and a liberal it is insane to me that in American politics the liberals support the Palestinians while the conservatives support Israel.
The progressive leadership's acceptance of anti-Israel (far more than pro-palestinian) and antisemitic people makes me hesitant to throw my support behind people whose ideas and ideals I may otherwise back.

Meanwhile the Israelis are mostly secular, have huge gay pride parades, have a democratically elected government, freedom of the press etc... you would think liberals would naturally align.

It’s funny because if you call say bmw or Volkswagen or any modern vehicle a car than calling this piece of shit a car as well is like comparing wright brothers early machine to let’s say F16. It’s not even the same scale, like that moskvich dump will potentially have zero safety features, I would be surprised if seatbelts are present. In terms of traction control systems again zero, engine will probably be shared with some tractors they still produce, bodywork will start rusting on the production line… Russians have no access to western technology, whatever they can copy or steal they will use but it’s still going to be a total disaster. It’s still funny to watch because it’s amazing how fucked up putin regime is and Russians still don’t seem to protest. Like the standards of living over there are plummeting but they still have fun, I guess Russians are really different breed altogether.
Of course, if things deteriorate enough, Russian citizens have a history of being quite “energetic” in their demands for change.

If anyone wonders why Russian citizens of today are so tolerant of Putin, perhaps the film series will help to explain why.

The Russian people have a living memory of profound collapse and chaos. Incredible deprivation, crime, hunger, etc. People will tolerate an awful lot if they can eat and otherwise live in relative security.
Yes the Jan 6 terrorists were a mixed group of people but successful would only describe a minority. There are a lot who had previous gun and/or domestic violence charges. There were more than a few severely mentally disturbed. Most of them only got to DC because of outside funding. Most of them are racists. Not many are well educated. What all of them are is gullible people who got brainwashed and fell for the con just like Jim Jones followers did. Instead of drinking poison they attacked the US government and destroyed their lives.
If Republican mocs had stood their ground from their first statements after the attack instead of slithering back to the antichrist we would be recovering. Never forget the Republicans who are as responsible for the destruction of America as trump is.

This won’t improve if economic conditions get better, the price of gas is unrelated to this delusion, they will move on to the next thing to glare at, real or imagined. The only way to put an end to this insanity is for the rest of the nation, the other 70%, to vote them out of any and all power, which will force their hand to try and seize power through violent means and then you crush the movement once and for all.

Republican voters, by and large, do not see you as a fellow American if you do not believe as they do, support who they do or speak as they do. If you aren’t constantly reenforcing their worldview back to them, you are actively, intentionally and maliciously trying to undermine their country in their minds. Again, this is their country, not all of ours, to them only they are the real Americans.
I mean, if she said it, it is probably true. I've never seen anything from her that doesn't seem genuine. But I'm also not a kiwi and haven't really been paying that close attention to NZ.
NZ is a relative backwater in the middle of nowhere (relative to the West), that's why NZ issues barely make news in the West. The only reason we hear about NZ news is because we share a common language, otherwise it gets dumped into the ignore category/major news only like we have for Japan/China/India.

That said, if you think it is bad in the Netherlands, it's worse in NZ. I know everywhere has issues thanks to a decade of historically low interest rates and an unwillingness to build, but at least the houses you can't afford in the Netherlands are high quality whereas in NZ you are paying even more for damp houses that are falling apart.

It’s indisputable that our housing quality (for a supposedly wealthy country) is very poor, and looking at different metrics of housing affordability compared to other counties we’re paying much more (as vulcanstrike said, relative to our incomes).

Well it’s not like we can just leave the gangs to it, if crime is increasing and law enforcement isn’t proportionately increasing then we’ll become increasingly lawless.
If you read the article the fact it's a film directed by a woman is quite relevant. Passage from the article:
"I think if you're going to work through the list, maybe do it in reverse order and sort of build towards it, because it's quite an ask to invite people to see this.

Makes me wonder if it would be anything but an obscure old film had it been about a man and directed by a man.

I doubt that previous best ever film had "film directed by man..) headline. Also, article says that there were times, when those who selectected best films were criticized for choosing films without enough diversity. This choice might just be them trying to deflect this criticism, not because the film is actually worth it, especially since it is barely known to the general public, as opposed to previous selected films. The best thing would be not to include any characteristics of film directors themselves, so that critics would not be able to put their own stereotypes into judging the film. This way, best film wins.
I know a dude who was offered a position in the Communist Party in the '80s as he had made a name for himself within the Soviet defense industry.
I think it's more that you're hearing the clueless, entitled, rich classes bitch about their lost "freedoms". From friends there to musicians and artists I follow, there is no real bitching about this stuff, only disdain for Putin's regime for doing this. Of the "bitching" I've seen its purely in the sense of "fuck this awful war, we just wanna live our lives and let them live theirs.".

Idk. I suffer from depression and anxiety and I mean it when I say I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. And that includes Russians. Cut off every last product and service from the West.... but not medicine. Necessary medicine should be a human right.

Now, I can already see the replies that they should be - deserve to be - depressed and anxious. But the worst affected are the people not buying the propaganda, because they know shit is bad and atrocities are being committed by their country and it weighs on them. How can they be expected to start revolution if they can't even get out of bed? Many people can't afford to leave the country. They're trapped and know it and powerless and depressed.
I always follow that up by agreeing and saying that we as democrats would like to apologize by taking down all the confederate monuments, banning the confederate flag, and giving reparations to black people. Because of how naughty we were.
Oh, no, those are my suggestions for things that democrats can do for being responsible for the civil war that republicans should have no problems with, being the party of Lincoln.

Anyone apparently seriously invoking "both sides" is basically brain damaged or malicious at this point.
Kanye thinks he can go and casually tell a guy who really needs to be president to stay out of jail and bankruptcy that he's also running and be welcomed with open arms. Trump thinks anyone who isn't 100% on his side and willing to sacrifice everything in one-sided loyalty is evil.
They both live in their own separate narcissistic bubble, so I'd argue it happened in two separate realities and neither is the one we live in.

Having known a few narcissists in my life they are physically incapable of recognizing themself as the problem in all things and any therapists they have found that will point the finger inward are promptly fired. The ones they kept seeing are being played like a fiddle/if not narcissistic themselves, so they are kept around because they told these people what they want to hear.

Yes I hate to excuse shitty behavior because of mental illness but it is literally the reason they have shitty behavior.
I remember hearing anti-Democratic rhetoric in Evangelical churches in the 1980s, so it's not that new.
They were very specific that "the people shouldn't pick the leaders, only God has the power to do that," and reinforcing it by saying that Kings were more biblical than Presidents.

"The Media" did do the job that they were paid to do. "The Media" is a small collection of corporations that own all the various different outlets. That small collection of corporations have owners. Those owners are among the very same oligarchs that want to eliminate Democracy and replace it with a figurehead authoritarian dictator that they control.

They're the shrinking minority so they have to manipulate and carve up a democracy designed for majority rule. Gerrymandering was the first step to at least give them the chance to control some legislatures and the house. Next was controlling SCOTUS no matter how obviously ethical and possibly criminal their actions would be. McConnell wanted SCOTUS not for the evangelicals but to keep the GOP in power in whatever ways he could seize. Donors for the GOP and corporations and the wealthy demanded McConnell thwart the growing majority of the democrats.
Ehh it sort of is, you get delta 8 THC by converting it from CBD, essentially you add an acid, let the CBD turn into THC, then remove the acid, leaving you with a form of THC.
Yes, because delta variants are still forms of THC, if it behaves the same way (binding to your CB1 and CB2 receptors) it'll almost definitely show as THC on a test.

We really don’t know how CBD is manufactured and it’s not subjected to FDA approval. Not to mention the aspects of the illegal marijuama industry being involved. These products may very well end up being laced with Fentanyl as regular weed is being laced with this too. CBD needs to be banne in the USA too as the drug culture is getting out of control everywhere. THC and CBD need to be regulated like every other potent drug.
Diplomacy requires patience, negotiation, trust etc. and to throw early communications at the ravenous, dishonest media is an amateur move for a world leader, especially considering the amount of people who are at risk of being affected by trade sanctions China could levy if relations sour....it happened in Australia and whole industries were decimated.
I get everyone on Reddit hates China, but it's weak sauce for Trudeau to frame leaking diplomatic communications as promoting democracy and freedom, such a naive north American response.

I don’t see much general anti-Chinese sentiment on Reddit. There’s always one guy that’s openly hateful, but there’s also always that one person being vile about everyone and everything so I don’t feel like we’re being specially mistreated. Most of the criticism I’ve seen IS about their authoritarian government, the Uyghur camps, foreign interference, etc. And most of the people I see getting offended by that are people who can’t separate Chinese cultural identity from those things, so I feel like they are the problem.

It often spills over and becomes a general hatred of the people/culture/all things China because most people don't have the nuance to separate Government from Nation.
So uh...yeah I wouldn't say it's ridiculous to call it a failed state lol. Beautiful country, good people, but it is a failed state. At best, a failing state.
I wouldn’t say it’s a failed state. Those headlines aren’t common, narco violence is localized on some hot spots around the country. The news make Mexico seem like it’s in a perpetual state of war but there’s millions and millions of people who will never encounter any direct issue with any cartel other than getting offered drugs at clubs.

The question here is what exactly constitutes a failed state. No one is saying Mexico doesn't have a huge issue with organized crime, but to me cities like Mérida, Mexico City, Monterrey, Puebla, Querétaro, Guadalajara, etc. could simply not exist in a failed state.

I think the distinction that matters here is the failed state vs failing state. Haiti at the moment would be an example of a failed state. Chaos is rampant in Haiti and there's no working government to deal with the issues. A failed state like that is an urgent very urgent crisis and mexico hasn't quite gotten there yet.
Sweden trained resistance fighters from Denmark, Finland and Norway during WW2, it served as a base for those to train and infiltrate back into occupied territories for sabotage missions, harassment of the Nazi armed forces, etc.
Or maybe people here in Sweden just don't like wars and shit and it's worked for 200+ years, even during WW2?

They suddenly are ready to join because now they realize that there's no such thing as being neutral these days. Impossible. Russia would eventually roll right in. And Sweden knows this.

Nobody likes wars. People do like other people defending themselves so they don't have to do it themselves. Nobody likes war. It worked for 200 years while you did things like "not helping in WW2 to fight Hitler as he exterminated millions of people. Yup...it has worked for 200 years-for Sweden. Selfish. Can't fight for what's right when the situations happen. Do ya know what-stay neutral buddy...just learn how to speak Russian. You're going to want to do that. Mr. Neutral .

If they did what you just said, then I guess they HAVE NOT remained neutral for 200 years. I'm guessing they didn't help the Nazis like they did the Allies. That isn't neutral. It's supporting one side of the war without officially declaring war. There's no ignorance here and you can't win the argument now. You just lost it. Now scram....

"Neutral'.....In this case, it means they don't know right from wrong, or don't want to be inconvenienced. They are too scared to stand up for what's just and good, because it may throw off their way of living. I say tell'em to pound salt.
Right for this specific package it is. But the majority of everything we sent is not. The US is more focused on military aid than economic in the grand scheme.
It's been weapons and supplies the whole time and mind you the equipment is mostly from pre 2000's Era. All of this equipment would have otherwise rotted in our reserves. The EU is handling Ukraines financials and the US is handing physical equipment. There's a good thread below that gives quite a good breakdown of western aid to Ukraine.

Don’t get me wrong: Ukraine needs aid to survive and win this war. But, with how much we spend in defense, we’re really neglecting our own people unnecessarily.

Society in general has to spend outrageous amounts of money to handle the small % of the population that doesn't want to behave as expected.

They're getting the money either way. This particular instance just means the equipment gets to serve a purpose rather then filling up a warehouse.

The only way to maintain the ability to produce these things is to just keep making them, even when they're not needed right away.
>...the insurrectionary right absolves itself of responsibility for their repeated failures of judgment. Already, the incoming House Republican majority seems committed to engaging in quixotic flights of fancy that provide Republican members platforms to grandstand upon, even if that only reminds persuadable voters that the GOP has no interest in governing. And the most quixotic of all lost causes is the one in which Trump is most invested: investigations into his enemies.
In that scenario, then whoever made the deal with Trump would be completely disincentivized to actually follow through on a pardon, nobody wants to be the next Gerald Ford in U.S. politics. I'd be ok with that, too.

They deserve it for not impeaching him when they had their two chances to do so. I hope he loses the GOP primary, forms the Trump Party, and splits the GOP vote for a decade or more.

If something untoward happens to Donald Trump, I would look very seriously at those with the most to gain by taking Trump out of the game, and it won't be the Democrats.

The irony here is, some of the politicians still suck at his teat (Graham, Cruz just to name a couple) back in 2016, they said if they nominate Trump, it will be the end of the Republican Party. Their words, not mine.
98% an accident, but the response will be critical. Otherwise a missile will hit downtown Lublin or a supply depot in Rzeszów and Russia will be like “oops sowwy 🥺” all over again.
I would hope that an expeditious deployment of high grade western anti-air systems, from Patriot to C-RAM comes of this. Ukraine should not need to even consider defending itself with 1970s soviet junk that might as well be a bow and arrow compared to what we have.

Their goal is to make Ukraine part of Russia, bringing NATO into the war would be counterproductive to say the least.

The distinct impression I've had for a while is that Russia is trying to avoid further NATO involvement. Sure, their in-house propaganda says that NATO is fighting a proxy war with Ukraine but they probably know that they'd be in even worse shape if they drew NATO into the war.

my armchair conspiracy is that Russia knew they were going to do something to piss Europe off even more beyond just striking at Ukraine today.

Also there are reports that Russia mysteriously shut off the druzhba pipeline to Eastern Europe before the missile attack.
To be honest her party DID kill the complete solar cell industry in germany which lead to solar becoming such a minor player in germany's energy plans.
In tandem with the EU that ditched protective tarifs after other EU countries complained that only Germany was profiting (since they were the only EU country with a large domestic solar industry).

Or is Russia controlling Germany to be one of the few countries to impose even more oil sanctions than the EU could decide on (together with Poland)? Maybe they are controlling Germany to take in a million Ukrainian refugees? Or they are controllin Germany to be one of the top 5 countries giving Ukraine military aid? Maybe they also controlled Germany to halt NS2 __two days before__ the invasion? Or they controlled Germany to get rid of Russian gas imports in less than a year?

Do you think Russia supplying gas to China instead of EU makes Russia more or less afraid of EU sanctions? I think Russia cares less about EU sanctions if Russia mostly sells gas to China. Note also in the real world EU has imposed many more restrictions on Russia, leverage from energy supply be damned, than China has.

What I wonder is why they became so dependent on Russian energy in the first place when they should've seen this coming. France for example used to be heavily invested in nuclear energy, had the cheapest energy in europe and exported it to their neighbors and even they have moved away from that. Likely for political reasons. If germany and other EU countries heavily invested in nuclear 20, even 10 years ago this situation with russia wouldn't be so messy. Demand for Russian resources has made sanctions ineffective and allowed russia to write off(default on) their debt and finance this war by selling resources in rubles to BRIC and OPEC countries.
I am just realizing that the whole war will be a slapstick comedy show one day. Putin being surrounded by yes-men who occasionally and randomly fall out of windows, troops that get to read super old maps that still show funny archaic landmarks, guns just breaking at the most inopportune moments, people surrendering to child's toy drones.. it's all just so absurd.
One of the weirdest thing about this has been the cases of soldiers sending photos of KIA enemy soldiers to their families over IM so that the Russians cannot pretend that they didn't die in combat.

Worthy of note that this program started under Obama by which the US provided substantial military support and training to Ukraine after the 2014 invasion is a BIG part of why the latest invasion met with so much resistance. The Russians found themselves fighting a Ukrainian military with modern weapons, modern training, and American military experts on speed-dial.

The US has been deploying guardsman to Ukraine to provide two to three week long training programs on using Javelins and other weapons since right after the 2014 invasion. The national guard is a great resource for this kind of training because they do those sort of short deployments and have a lot of technically skilled long-time soldiers available to do this sort of training.
They won because redistricting was made non-partisan by voters in 2018. Before this year, a majority of Michiganders voted for Democrats to represent them, while Republicans won the majority of seats due to gerrymandering.
State is 36% Dem, 30% Rep and we now have a GOP super majority state senate, majority Rep state house, and most frighteningly a majority Rep state supreme court (that has been Dem a long time and prevented a lot of GOP BS). All due to atrocious gerrymandering.

The senate race was based on popular vote and the results were 50% vs. 47%. Yet our state legislature "somehow" (that was sarcasm, I actually mean it's gerrymandered) ended up with GOP majority house and super majority senate.

Governor is Dem still at least but like when the GOP Governor lost to him, I'm sure our GOP majority will strip him of his power with no State Supreme Court to be reasonable.

Districting is done by an independent commission, which is almost certainly the reason why Dems were able to flip the state legislature.

Turns out things are possible when majorities of the voters are for you and you're NOT fighting with both hands bound behind your back.

Funny how we don't see 'CBS and FOX on the hotseat for pushing gambling ads during family sporting events.'.

All paid for by those companies... so again, the issue is with the networks selling the space to them.

We know what they told us - they would have no reason to withhold a simple thing like this. Further, the partnership reduces the need for ads anyway as their branding is visible throughout the product as it airs. The ads are icing on top because they get even more.

This isn't about gambling - it's about advertising. If you're upset about the ads - blame the one party that actually sells the ad space. The networks.

What does this have to do with those networks? The networks are running ads, and when they are not, they are displaying promotional materials for those sites. Or starting their own "pick them" game.
Bwahaha you didn't get why I said South Asia here. It's because both India and Bangladesh have a shared history when it comes to US/West. In 1971 the US/West supported their "ally" Pakistan against Bangladesh (which was then called "East Pakistan"). US/West basically condoned Pakistan's genocide againt Bangla people during that struggle. When India intervened and helped Bangladesh and defeated Pakistan, US/West were furious. At one point US also sent their aircraft carrier into the Bay of Bengal but backed off when the Soviet Union called their bluff. Due to this shared history both Indians and Bangladeshi (and most of South Asia in general) have deep rooted mistrust of US/West.
That deep-rooted mistrust from Bangladesh also applies to India if you know anything about recent history lmfao -.

Hey doofus, learn to read. It say;s "South East Asia" - Bangladesh isn't part of South East Asia (it starts at Myanmar "Doofus". If you're going to try and correct me, at least be right and learn some geography lmfao.

I don't think Bangladesh and India has necessarily the same values though (anti-muslim bill being one example - and the country protesting Modi's visit) - but nonetheless, the US/West would rather have these smaller nations hosting these factories since they don't have the population to be a big problem whereas India does.

And 2nd, what does being an ally have to do with this? Simply said it's a better geopolitical move long-term to invest in Bangladesh and South East Asian vs. India - but you Indians are so mad lmfao.
Legit ask, why is this uniquely laid at their feet? Dems contested and denied 2000. Dems contested and denied 2016. Dems said they would contest and denied a fair election in 2020 up until they won. However, apparently this is only a Republican issue?
It is disingenuous to dismiss 2000 by speaking on Gore only. He was not the only figure in that debacle nor was there zero rhetoric of "fraud." Let's not forget, he did rescind his concession. What transpired through the recount process was a lot of claims of fraud during the fight.

The part about claims of fraud in 2000. Gore wanted a hand recount because it appeared his supporters were more likely to have minor mistakes in the ballots, which would have shown up on a hand recount. He rescinded his concession when it became clear NBC (influenced heavily by Bush’s cousin, believe it or not) was talking out of its ass when it called Florida. (Similar to Fox talking out of its ass when it called Arizona in 2020.).

which is again not true. They will try more and try again, but they will try new tactics so maybe it won't be "denial" as much as stealing elections through.
I never had any issues with people from Poland. They work hard, have been friendly. But this PiS BS must end.
This blaming for things, the PiS wouldn't do either. Or did I miss that Poland asked the US for export permission? Or sent troops and lost NATO protection?

As far as I now, Poland asked the US for Patriots and troops to handle them. Poland also bought some. I confused these two systems and thought Poland operates patriots.

Poland does not have Patriot system. Best Poland had was S-125 Newa-SC which was recently photographed in Ukraine. Another system Poland supposedly sent are short range 9K33 Osa systems. Polish AD forces were like Polish submarines, stuck in 60s/70s. Now they are being upgraded but deliveries just began.

The systems in southern Poland are US Army patriot systems set up around Rzeszów. As of why, well It is not a big secret most of supplies for Ukraine are flown there, as well as supplies for 10000 US Soldiers who are stationed in this region of Poland.

That's correct one is protecting the Rzeszów airport which is the main hub for receiving military aid destined for Ukraine and the other is protecting US troops stationed in western Poland.
Does that mean the federal government gets to be involved? Because I think I remember Florida itself has a no extradition clause within its own state, but idk if that overrides international requests?
Brazil would be notifying the US that they would like their citizen back, assuming quickly that what I read was true (not sure if it is,just using the assumption to clarify).

Brazil and the US have an extradition treaty, which means that as soon as someone is judged guilty in one country, the other is obligated to comply. The only possibility for the US to deny an extradition inquiry from Brazil is that if there’s a justifiable suspicion of human rights violations (for example, if the criminal is sentenced to death, the other country shouldn’t expatriate him).
Just think of the bullshit that could flow from that scenario. Say you were an employee of the state of Texas and your spouse was getting cancer treatment paid for through being on your family plan.
Don't forget the equally important detail that if you are already married and Obergefell is overturned you won't suddenly wake up one morning to find your marriage annulled - with all the legal and medical problems that would entail.

Then in that case the compromise of "you can serve, but you have to stay in the closet" was a shitty result, but it was a lot better than "you can't serve at all, and the cops will track you down to kick you out.".

This is how it should be. It is a bit crazy how closely intertwined religion still is with government, and the ramifications that has for everyone. It makes no sense for "marriage" to have arbitrary religious qualifications when marriage holds legal weight for everyone.

I think it should be obvious that marriage equality isn't some special privilege, it's an inherent right. Otherwise, heterosexual marriage is a special privileged (tax, legal etc) status only open to some individuals.

Nominally Israel and Saudi governments have no issue with each other and have been working with each other for quite some time.
Saudi Arabia doesn't normalize relations because most of their population hates Israel; but on a political level, both are US client states and honestly quite close.

For now it hasn't translated much to governments which are still heavily supportive of Israel but that isn't going to remain the same in the future if more and more of the population aren't supportive of it.

And yes whilst Israel is incredible dysfunctional politically the right and far right has been in power for the last 20 years and they have continously made the situation worse. Even if this coalition doesn't last more than a year it is still going to make policies that will have an effect.

Much of the middle east do not even see it as terrorism(which it is), rather as resistance fighters and that view isn't going anywhere either when they can put up pictures of dead civilians to Israeli missile strikes whilst ignoring the reason behind those. Media is a business and they like to highlight what sells.
I definitely do, all the time. We live in a world though where people will post a question on reddit rather than using a search engine, so... whaddya do? Thanks for the updates. They're a morning and nightly ritual now as well as checks throughout the day!
Expected was 4-5 salvos remaining last time at a rate of 90-100 missiles per salvo at the time. They'll probably have to stop before they use them all to have a "strategic" reserve. The size getting smaller might be indicative of them getting closer to that point.

Arestovych said 2 or 3 months ago that very conservative numbers were 100 Russians lost there per day. It's a city previously with a population of 70,000 people so it's not small, that's very believable.

They haven't been trying really. It's basically impossible to coordinate realistically. There's such a large disparity in speeds between the mopeds and the missiles that you need to know exactly where the air defense is to time it right, and if they knew that they'd be trying to hit the air defense.

They need more short range air defense to thwart the Iranian drones, the gepards and someone has to have some old Vulcan air defense systems stocked up somewhere, there were many thousands of them before they were decommissioned- but other countries had them too. Those would be effective and a cheaper way to stop an inexpensive drone. Save the patriots for the planes and cruise missiles.
>If Jesus got a bad rap while Trump was president, it is no one’s fault but that of the right-wing Christians who could have rejected him but instead venerated him.
The irony of it all is that this week's gospel is from the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus says to make amends with each other, and to pray for our enemies. It's truly sad that a religion has been coopted by radical evangelicals in the name of hate. I'm sad that this company is backed by the wrong people, but this is the message of Jesus that needs to be taught. If liberal Christians aren't going to use it, someone else will. Christianity will forever be associated with hate until those with love use it for love.

So I agree with the sentiment and I will continue to do my part to try and educate others what the true meaning of this religion is, but it's an uphill battle. I mean, our president is a Catholic and hasn't spoken much on these issues. He can 180 them like he did at the SOTU and point out their hypocrisy. For fuck's sake the word literally comes from the bible.

What pisses me off, as someone who've lived a year in Saudi, is that if the west/Fifa just had a spine they'd easily run over qatars bullshit, they're so focused on image that they'd never be able to jail several hundred people wearing rainbowflags. But instead we have our own godamn governments and football-clubs licking the balls of qatari shitheads, asking people to adapt to these bullshit rules. Since people are sheep, they then follow that.

Had Germany, UK, France and Italy said "fuck off" you think Fifa or qatar would still enforce the rules? It'd be a world historic failure of qatar if they did so they'd ofcourse change course and let people have fun.
None of the media outlets that are calling races are presenting what the second and third choice votes are. This is probably because they haven’t figured out how to poll for it, since ranked choice voting is so rare in the U.S.
I found data on the turnout for the primaries and it was only 32% then, but I don’t know if that is the November turnout, too.

The CA gov site says turnout was 32.7% as of Nov 12, but I don’t know if that number is limited to processed ballots only or if it includes received but not processed ballots.

In a lot of states that have mail-in voting, you just have to mail the ballot back by election day, so there's a week or so where ballots are still coming in and are valid and should be counted. Some of these races are close enough that it actually matters this time, where in the past gaps were large enough that the number of outstanding ballots couldn't make up the difference and the race could be called.

They really have to figure out how to get response rates back up. Whether that's via online polling, using numbers that actually resolve on caller ID to trusted names like Gallup, paying people for responses... the status quo just isn't working anymore.

Polling is also having some major issues right now with historically low response rates. Statisticians know that the people who do respond are not like the rest of the population, but it's hard to quantify just how they're different given the low response rate.
211/435 races have been called for the Republicans, compared to 199/435 for Democrats. The magic number to control the House is 218 (435/2=217.5, so 218 is a majority) and Republicans lead in the votes for 10/25 uncalled races. This would put them at 221-214, a narrow majority. Democrats would need 4 of those remaining races to break for them in the final few ballots without losing their lead in any one of their current 15 leads to hold their majority. It's not impossible, but it is unlikely that it happens.
Regardless, whoever the Republicans (or Democrats) would elect as Speaker of the House is going to have to contend with the need to reach across the aisle for votes or placate the extreme fringes of their party. If the Lord of Hamberders continues to drive a wedge between the Republican base, things could get difficult for a Republican majority leader.

Boehner had a much, much larger majority than what the projected Republican majority will be. There are moderate Republicans, even if the mainline party is entrenched, and everyone in the House is up for re-election in 2 years.

Or if the Republicans took the House, but the ones that support DeSantis vote to let the committee continue?

Well, thats not how it works as noted below....Also, Republicans won't have control of the Senate and will most likely only have a small lead in the House. I guess Trump finally did some good with his endorsements. I kinda actually hope he runs so the Dems can win even more Senate seats and get back the House majority in 2 years while the Republican party implodes.

If anything, the republicans will probably want him to go away at this stage so he won’t have a chance to rip the party apart when he inevitably loses the primaries to DeSantis.
Since the Syrian refugee crisis began, there's been a large amount of social tension and unrest in Sweden. Arab and North African migrants have been failing to integrate successfully into Swedish culture, instead forming ethno enclaves and parallel society.
He's doing this because as a free Swede, it's his right free speech, including burning the Koran. He's trying to agitate and prove that Islam and it's intolerant followers have no place in modern Sweden/Western Europe. Unfortunately, the violent backlash from the Swedish Muslim community is proving him right.

There is however a limit to how much contempt you can express against swedes, muslims and turks before it's considering inciting hatred against that group.

The distinction is drawn between the population group and the entity which is associated with them. For example, it's legal to say whatever you want about Sweden and Turkey and to burn their respective flags. Likewise, it's legal to insult any religion and burn their symbols.

What's wrong with burning the Quran? Is it gonna hurt Mohammed or Allah? I don't understand people who serve gods that need humans to protect and defend them. What's your god gonna do for you if he's depending on you to always do stuff for him. That sounds like a puny god, not worthy of anyone's fealty. Imo.

Ok, so I own a thing. It's my thing. I bought it with my money. Paid tax on it and everything. I can burn it, pee on it, put it somewhere unsavoury or even eat it. What I do with my thing is my business. I really don't get why anyone would care what I did with my thing as long as it didn't damage anyone else's thing. Not to mention that the correct way to dispose of a Qur'an is to burn it, so even in this instance, what kind of halfwit would care? You do you and I'll do me. I was a Bible person once. I have never cared what anyone did with a Bible. It's a book. There's billions of them. Who gives a shit if someone burns their own copy of the bible? Now if they did it in a mosque, that action would be very disrespectful, but the actual loss of a single book is irrelevant. There's lots more.
There are a lot of sub-issues here. First of all is that the older the munition the exponentially less useful it is. These things, if not stored correctly, become dangerous to move and handle over time. At some point Russia will reach a point where these weapons are hitting them more than the Ukrainian.
Second, older weapons are shorter range and you push back the amount of Ukrainian territory in Russia's range.

But old dumb artillery with a range under 50 km can't destroy civilian targets in Odessa, Kyiv and other cities and villages west of the frontlines.

You do make good counterpoints, but those older munitions are doing the job they were designed to do -- the number of villages and cities leveled in Ukraine is sickening. They have tons more dumb artillery to keep at this for a long time. Russia has more of a manpower problem than weapons.

On the positive side, the weapons NATO is supplying are destroying Russian weapons. The arguments against supplying 4 weapons that Ukraine wants doesn't make sense. Ukraine has said that they would tell NATO beforehand what the targets of ATACMS would be. If NATO believes Western fighter planes and tanks would be too complicated to Ukraine, why does Ukraine want them? Start training Ukrainians and have them decide. The Patriot air defense system is available to supply.
Anybody who followed the events as they unfolded knows that he said it in a completely different context (stopping the certification), and the issue was settled by Feb 22nd with Germany ending it. It‘s obvious how Russian trolls are trying to capitalize on the gullibility of the uninformed.
The Russians are quite capable of harming themselves in order to blame others or send a message though.

The reason why I don't think it was Russia is simply because it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face. They own the pipeline. The gas that travels down it is a major source of income for them. There is no scenario I can possibly think of where it benefits them to cause damage to their own assets.

Other countries have been bandied about, pretty much all of them NATO countries including the US. But while everyone is claiming it was sabotage, we haven't really seen any evidence in public that it was. Fragments of a detonating mechanism, or the bomb itself, etc. So we basically have to take the word of governments for it, and they may have some hidden incentives.

So I'm still not completely counting out the idea of accidents due to poor maintenance and lack of use. Especially since they happened 17 hours apart.

It benefits a number of other countries, though. Foremost being Ukraine, but I honestly don't think they've got the assets to pull something like that off. At least, not without some major outside help.
Do you think the price of goods would come down with strangled supply lines, or would it be even more expensive?
The price of goods are high, so what does the the government do to curb inflation? They raise the interest rates How does that effect the working class? Your average worker can now not afford to lend money. Does this do anything to bring down prices? Sure, but business owners sett the price in the first place The rich have had record profits in almost every sector since COVID, and the poor have effectively become poorer due to inflation and limited access to credit!

Biden conceded. Made it illegal for the workers to add to the discourse no striking no really consequences because "ooh no my economy". I could go thru supply shortages for a few months if it means the working class can collectively bargain. I'm already a fucking poor man as it is. Not many businesses would survive tho and that's all that matters to a politician in this country. Their donors are king.

Keeping the country running is more important than workers rights. That's the whole issue. This is just COVID lockdowns all over again.
I dunno, trump has a habit of admitting to actual crimes so at this point I think there absolutely needs to be an investigation into this because of the possibility that it’s an actual crime he’s casually dropping because he’s throwing a tantrum.
While that question is unsettled, we are 100% guaranteed that Trump will call any investigation that attempts to answer the question a "witch hunt", and that he has been "unfairly treated", "maybe the most unfairly treated person ever.".

2018 - "That's such a funny ad. What a great sense of humor, DeSantis has." Then DeSantis used Trump as a model, including gaining weight, imitating his manners, making empty promises, getting a Nazi Barbie press secretary (who was an unregistered foreign agent), pushing xenophobia and COVID misinformation, threatening those who disagreed with him and abusing his power to punish them.

They're out there. My father in law is one of them. He cannot vocalize that he was wrong but he is so disappointed in himself. He will still vote Republican tho. He really had no idea Trump was a bad person because he exclusively watched FOX.
Most gas is used for building heating. There, it could be replaced by heat pumps powered by renewables. But one challenge is that most energy is needed in winter where solar is sparse.
Not fit for heat pumps is kind of a myth. There are heat pumps capable of heating even poorly isolated buildings, but they are less efficient. Therefore, it is better to isolate all buildings and then convert them to heat pumps.

Heat pumps are a much more efficient use of electricity than converting electricity into any kind of fuel. Efficiency of heat pumps can be up to 400%. The problem is not every home and not every heating system is fit for using heat pumps and our capacity for installing new heat pumps already is at its limit.

Electricity can't be stored though, that's why you get problems when more and more heat pumps are installed. Heat pumps are great when they replace direct heating with electricity, not so great when they replace conventional boilers.

Replacing all gas and oil boilers with heat pumps would increase demand of electricity during the winter months enormously, it's probably better to develop more environmentally friendly fuels for heating.
Ukraine is valuable land. Rich in resources and agriculture. Putin doesn't care about military losses and will keep throwing bodies at it hoping he can win a battle of attrition with UKR forces or until NATO countries tire of arming Ukraine. Which they wont. The military industrial complex thrives on this type of open ended conflict. Since Russia and Ukraine share a border this won't end soon. Russia will keep up "special operations" indefinitely in order to disqualify Ukraine from NATO membership. They will roll out more tanks and send more men into the grinder until Putin shuffles off this mortal coil.

Quick Edit - Maybe California's law won't pass constitutional muster if challenged either. Which I'm sure it will be. And there's 12 years before 2035. Who knows what kind of new battery tech may exist or if major brands will even make non EV's anymore.
One of the biggest challenges facing EVs is the limited range of the batteries. While many modern EVs can travel over 200 miles on a single charge, this is still not enough for long-distance travel or for those who live in rural areas with limited charging options. Until the range of EVs can be extended, it will be difficult for them to replace gasoline-powered vehicles as the primary mode of transportation.

To be clear, I agree that few if any living more than an hour from a freeway or highway would want an EV, though if they have electricity so far from such roadways, they should be able to recharge at home, no?

In the longer term, IF reliable FUSION power becomes economical, then I figure EVs are likely to become so much cheaper than internal combustion engines that even Wyoming voters would figuratively flay any state legislator who kept them from saving money by using EVs.

There are times one must ponder the benefits of Yellowstone blowing up, thus forcing GAWD to start over with Wyoming (and Idaho and Montana if not nearly all the US west of the Mississippi).
I've seen this with younger Evangelical acquaintances of mine. There is a minority of them who are oriented toward social justice and inclined to support movements like BLM (maybe not the political arm of it, but the message for sure).
To be sure, this is a minority. But it's a much bigger minority than the older generations of Evangelicals.

It sounds like Gen Z Evangelicals are more intelligent than the older generation. The new documentary on Jerry Falwell, Jr. is very revealing. You had the leader of the most conservative religious university in the country ask Trump for help to bury a story that was a major scandal. You can’t make this up. His wife seduced a 20 year old pool boy, brought him back to their place, and asked if it was okay for her husband to watch. In walks Jerry Falwell, Jr.

Trump’s fixer, Michael Cohen, helped bury this story all while Falwell, Jr was praising Trump and promoting him to other Evangelical leaders. Will Evangelicals ever admit that they were duped by a con artist and a pathological liar? My guess is no. It is very embarrassing and reeks of the hypocrisy in the party that has intertwined religion with politics into a fucked up cult. And keep in mind, this is all while Trump’s fixer, Michael Cohen, was paying off porn star Stormy Daniels who Trump had an affair with.
Bruh, Football is probably THE most popular sport in the world. That's not even an over-exaggeration. It may not be that important in the US but the US isn't the entire world.
Here's the deal - Homophobia is a part and parcel of Islam. And that's the reason why it isn't tolerated in Islamic countries. I'm not trying to be Islamophobic or anything, just stating a fact.

I know Christianity frowns upon homosexuality as well, but the US, UK and other European Nations has a sizable chunk of people who are atheist/agnostic or practice other faiths so the rampant homophobia of years past is kind of dying down but practically speaking, you can't expect a country where the vast majority of people are Islamic to be tolerant to it.

There is overwhelming evidence that homosexuality in all its forms is strongly disliked in Middle Eastern countries, at least relative to the attitudes of Westerners in Western countries.

Try being more imaginative. Both of the stories are, at their core, people who broke the law in authoritarian countries a) knowing that they were breaking the law and could face punishment, and b) knowing that the country carries out draconian punishments. (Optional Similarity c) They are both from the US.).

Yup. Had some buddies in US SpecOps in Afghanistan. They told me that it was insanely difficult to deal with the tribal leaders, due to all the child sexual assault they committed and approved of. Stuff we actively suppress in other places, but weren't allowed to because "it's a cultural norm" for those POS'.
The term "battle tank" means a self-propelled armoured fighting vehicle, capable of heavy firepower, primarily of a high muzzle velocity direct fire main gun necessary to engage armoured and other targets, with high cross-country mobility, with a high level of self-protection, and which is not designed and equipped primarily to transport combat troops. Such armoured vehicles serve as the principal weapon system of ground-force tank and other armoured formations.
To summarize - In English everything is a fighting vehicule and only the tank is armored. In German everything is armored but only the tank is a fighting vehicule.

The thing is that in german, almost all armoured vehicles are called "Panzer". If you look up the entry for "Panzer" in the dictionary, it says "tanks". In German, the thing being sent is indeed a "tank".

And there really isn't much point in trying to argue that that the term in a German publication is wrong and that those aren't tanks, because thats not what a huge part of the german population would tell you if you polled them about it, e.g. showed them the image of a Marder. If you asked them if thats a tank, almost everyone will say "yes". Because to us, it obviously is a "Panzer".

Yes I do agree it's a sentiment widespread across most Western democracies, people want to vote to impact those they see as a barrier to their success, mostly, completely wrongly. Examples that are quite common are 'migrants are taking our jobs' or migrants are taking all the good jobs' or X-ethnic group are causing all the crime.
Thank you for sharing, we can't choose our family or the society we grow up in. I departed Christianity early so it's good to be reminded of the power it has over so many. Social mores kind of self perpetuate and often attract an adherence verging on reverence. "Alcohol is good" "We've always done it this way" "Us X'ers have always been tough" etc etc. Undoubtedly this is part of the paradox of why so many vote for politicians that stand against their rights and welfare.

Honestly, the absolute defense of German foreign policy incompetence is rivaling the most hardcore of brexiteer.

That's just shy of the daily death toll for the British army in World War 1, when we had four million men in the army alone fighting across five major fronts on three continents.
Assuming that the Russians really do have 300k men in Ukraine, that's a per capita loss rate equivalent to six times the loss rate for the British army at the height of the Somme offensive.

Then again one could argue that the entire Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv fronts were the Russian forces blundering far beyond their supply lines and meeting similar fates.

If the Ukrainians are seriously already threatening Chaplynka less than a week after liberating Kherson city, they might go all the way to Melitopol from the west.

We were all assuming Ukraine would regroup to the Zaporizhzhia front and attack towards Tokmak/Melitopol from the north. Well I guess if they can get over the river on pontoons (!), they can just keep hitting the Russians from the west. I suppose this could also be a feint, with the main thrust coming from Zapo still. But what a development.
It is not some aspirational role. It is the job of the civilian commander in chief of the military. It is the role that is able to draft and sign treaties on behalf of the entire nation. It is the job of managing the entire executive branch of the federal government of our nation. There is no reason whatsoever that we have to accept anything less than the absolute best for that office.
If I was choosing which company to invest in and while doing my research found out about a company that had an exciting new product or service or way of doing business that I wanted to support but their CEO was an incompetent fool I would hold off for a while to see whether that fool would sink the ship before putting my money into it.

It shouldn't have taken any time at all. If you are not willing to make your tax returns public you should not qualify to run for president.

We should all have seen Trump's tax returns 7 years ago when he announced he was running for President. He wasn't hiding them because there was nothing scandalous in there.
It isn't. Don't act like the poor Christian conservatives of Georgia don't willingly flock to the polls every election year to cast their vote for anybody with an R next to their name on the ballot. I'm so tired of the rich being the only people we blame for doing shitty things. The poor suck, too.
I was raised in the exact same environment, with the exact same economic status, and educated in not just the same school system but literally within the same schools. It was incumbent upon these people to make an attempt to educate themselves or at the very least listen to an idea that went contrary to what they've been taught, and they all chose not to do so. Yes the wealthy and the political ruling class have deliberately dumbed down the populous, but that does not excuse the people from never even trying to better themselves or to hear ideas that were not their own. The voters are also the problem.

A lot of people split their ballot. There's a reason Kemp isn't in a run off. Easy to imagine a lot of people who grimmaced and voted straight ticket but showed up for Kemp won't show. Also Senate control is off the table right now for Republicans, which also lowers the excitement for the straight ticket voters and might even swing a handful of voters who feel like they're voting to not have a laughingstock as a senator instead of for the Senate at large.

I feel like her apathy is going to hit many voters in GA that would normally be a lock for R but just can't stomach voting for Herschel.

New Year's is the most important family holiday of the year in both Ukraine and Russia. Christmas was banned in the early days of the Soviet Union, and then secular Christmas traditions (the tree, gifts, songs and carols, large family meals, etc.) were moved to New Year's. In terms of social importance, it's equivalent to Christmas in Western Europe, the US, and other places that follow that tradition.
So while there's no cease fire rule, and it would be silly to expect any level of decency from Russia in this, it's still yet another particular evil.

And please, save yourself the trouble of "explaining" to me that terror-bombing, innocent-civilian-killing Russia bad. The difference in military eligibility of targets on either side, or the ethicality of either, are not in question for me, but are, as I said, not relevant for my point.

Human beings are killed by both sides on a holiday. Which is the only relevant part if the accusation is specifically about a lack of "Christian values" on one side - and therefore perfectly comparable. Or is "thou shalt not kill" conditional on what passport you carry, or what uniform you wear?

Zelensky can rightfully blame for Russia attacking, and especially attacking civilians, in general, on any day.

I'll explain it again: Zelensky condemns Russia performing terror-bombings of Ukrainian civilians on a holiday.

It's a logical fallacy to even try to compare one thing to another - as if Russia bombing civilians on a holiday and Ukraine bombing Russian soldiers on a holiday are even remotely comparable.

If we're talking about logic, though - then yes, I can definitely accuse Russia of killing the civilians - who are not the combatants actively participating in the conflict - at the time of a holiday. Russian soldiers are combatants, civilians are not.
I mean, he has a point. Georgia doesn’t have a system that allows someone with just a plurality to win.
You can’t just people who want to run outside the two party system to fuck off because it ruins you idea of how you want your candidate to win. The election process should empower different views, not restrict them to a duopoly.

Right now a third party candidate's only purpose is to hand the election to the candidate who they are most dissimilar from. First past the post ensures that. Talking about how things 'should' be doesn't change the reality.

And if they do lose hard enough and for long enough, it might convince them that they need to start representing the actual will of the people and governing instead of just screaming about identity politics, trying to subvert our elections, and racing each other to see who can be the most despicable. Continually show the republicans that the US rejects the lunatics who run the party right now, and eventually they'll drop them.

Voting third party literally does nothing in the US, other than giving the party that least represents you a better shot at winning.

You want to get rid of first past the post? Great. That's a good goal. But first, let's ensure that democracy itself survives. It would be great if we had more than 2 serious political parties in this country, but right now we only have 1. Vote for democrats at every level. Give them strong majorities and lobby at the state level for ranked choice voting. You will never get that from republicans. Never. Democrats are the only choice.

If you're more liberal than the current Democrats you should vote for democrats and lobby them to enact progressive policies. As those policies take effect and work, push for candidates who more closely align to your values. And push for ranked choice voting.
'Hey dudes we need those Leopards back, we've asked America and they've agreed to backfill any holes you have with Abrams. We can promise you a next gen replacement deal in exchange for buying the tanks back from America once the new tanks are dlivered'.
America has promised Abrams to European countries to replace their tank stocks. Make a bilateral agreement between the countries with the 2a4's, america, and germany. America gives them tank replacements, they send their tanks back, germany promises to pay america for them, germany sells their new tank to said european countries for a discount when it is produced.

You would have to first convince these countries to give them up after they just send their old soviet tanks to Ukraine.

Ukrainians have already stated that they need thousands of tanks, though I hope the tanks + APCs and other defense/offensive weapons are able to do the job.
Its a fine question. We must always remain vigilant that nazis never gain a foothold again. Hitler himself said the one thing that would had stopped them is to strike their group in their infancy.
I think you're confusing geopolitics with noble earnest pursuits, its empire, its imperialism! Plenty of shitty things are done and excused towards this aim. We funded absolute trashfuck warlords in Iraq, paid for the expansion of wahabism in the middle east to the tune of billions, all for empire. Ukraine is no different, though you and I happen to morally dislike Russian expansion. Why is it so unplausable that Israel did a shitty thing to further their greater motive?

Edit: To be clear, only some Ukrainians are nazis or nazi sympathizers (the same thing), No it doesn't reflect on wider Ukraine writ large. Yes I support Ukraine in their fight against Putin's army.

I mean, at minimum the Azov batallion are in part or largely nazis, oddly Israel helps fund them for some reason. However, there are plenty of actual Russians nazis, though clearly Russia is fascist AF, the aggressor, and international threat to peace.

When the Jerusalem Post reports that Jewish Ukrainian groups are defending Azov as an apolitical military unit fighting against an actual threat to the Jewish community by Russia, chances are it's no longer a notorious Nazi group.
Back in March Lukashenko had a meeting in which he showed a map that was most likely the actual invasion map the Russians were using for Ukraine. On it are plans to invade Moldova after Ukraine is subjugated.
Russia would need to conquer South Ukraine to have any chance at any military occupation of Moldova. All the more reason to give more weapons and equipment to Ukraine.

For Russia to attack Moldova they would first have to secure the South of Ukraine. Moldova is landlocked. In any case, Russia would have to cross over Ukrainian soil. Russia would have to at least capture and defend Odessa and it s surrounding area.

Oddly enough, this was part of Russia's plan in the beginning. In a way, Ukraine is actually rescuing Moldova, by holding out themselves. Because I can guarantee you, if Russia was successful in Ukraine, Moldova would have quickly been next.

I think Moldova is a red herring Russia is drumming up support for by proxy to fuel more volunteers against Ukraine.

Russians may have war fatigue against Ukraine now or may start having doubts. Moldova would be a good way to convince them that this is an ‘easy’ victory but first they must plough through Ukraine.

Yup. We really need and deserve a coherent explanation. We’re shooting unknown things down over the mainland. That’s never happened before (at least publicly.) This is an extraordinary situation relating to national security and honestly I think we need to hear from Biden directly.

It’s possible we did know and a policy decision has been made to stop ignoring it. Something has certainly been up as all the UAP stuff has demonstrated.

It may end up being pretty problematic that we went down this path, honestly. China or anyone else (or everyone else) can keep our Air Force quite busy and make us look weak by launching balloons frequently. They are difficult to conclusively attribute so we likely wouldn’t be able to place the blame easily.

There are rumors abound that there may be enough Republicans to pass the seven day sick-leave amendment in the Senate:
As long as to a simply majority vote, then there only need to be 51 Senators needed to pass both the agreement and the amendment. If even one Senator objects, then a filibuster threshold of 60 Senators will be needed to vote in favor for either.

Sullivan confirmed that they sent word to Kremlin that Biden was taking the trip, i.e. it was never a surprise visit.
Missing the point. The notification meant that Putin had ample time to launch an accidental missile strike if he wanted to. I.e. Biden was never in danger and it was just a dumb photo op.

Which has backfired because, quoting another commentator, "The fact the US Secret Service allowed Biden into Kyiv for a stupid photo-op is a tacit admission on how restrained Russia is, and in fact, how trusted the Russians' word is.".

I know... Sure. He is an incompetent, ambition driven sycophant to the donor class, but he sure is snappy with the comebacks on Fox News!
I hate all the Pete worship from the partisan hacks that populate this sub. It's as if people don't actually get real news and instead watch the cable news team that tells them what they want to hear. While MSNBC isn't as much blatant propaganda as Fox, it's the same corporate owned, establishment defending, corrupt media.

He didn't win Iowa. He claimed he won Iowa. This man has no constituency aside from the Donors and the Media. He is not a skilled politicians and totally out of touch with people. Then he showed he is a total establishment jack by dropping out as soon as the opportunity to get a cabinet position appeared. He took the one he wanted and we have had failure after failure after failure because of it.

"Affordable high density housing" that blocked Tesla expansion in Fremont had homes at a million each. These are not ranch homes, they are stacked on one another. Toll Bros made a ton of money on them. Many buyers are living one family per bedroom (extended families), not one family per house.
How many New Yorkers are currently crammed into 2-3 bedroom units with roommates? How much does it cost to actually live alone? Building like Tokyo doesn't just mean building smaller housing. It means building abundant housing. Build so much of it that a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan built after 2000 costs $1500 a month to live in.

This is a small part of the overall problem, which is a housing supply shortage. Companies that buy single-family homes to rent out only do so in markets where zoning laws create artificial scarcity. Make it legal to build large amounts of new housing and you get rid of that artificial scarcity propping up home prices.

Affordable housing as in what a corroboration will take over and hike the rent. Buts that’s only because it will put money into the politicians pockets.
That's entirely on Russia. If they withdrew peacefully then we'd likely see them trying to sell more arms to ukraine especially since they have a valid reason for buying them. If Russia escalated to nukes them all bets off for the response. Nukes are the troubling part of course. However I'm just saying that this is the rare time that dems are doing the right thing in sending arms, not us troops, and it happens to favor the military industrial complex to the point that it's now the corruption that probably pushing the Republicans onto the correct path of support ukraine.
Most of the Republicans I see either casually dismiss Ukraine's issues and talk about spending (even if they claim to show sympathy for Ukrainians) or say Ukraine is corrupt and we shouldn't have any sympathy for them, and say either A) "not rooting for either Russia or Ukraine" or B) are full-blown Russia supporters.

And the handful of Republicans who have said they support Ukraine are all serial liars and people who have at best stood by silently when their party's done horrible things and at worst cheered those horrible things on, so nobody should doubt for a second that any Republican would turn their back on Ukrainians the second they thought it would serve their own goals regardless of what empty platitudes they throw out to the press when it's convenient.
Lol, that's a sensationalized headline, like everything else on this subreddit. Brinton is the "deputy assistant secretary" of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy. Not exactly the "Nuclear Waste Chief.".

This is way pettier a crime than Pruitt or Carson or Kushner level theft and gritfting, but it's from someone we believed was qualified and directly and immediately stealing from someone directly rather than them largely robbing groups and looting from the public. Yet, here it is, still front page. It's far more likely for Sam or any other Biden appointee to have their crimes blow up here if they happen, since there's less fellow cons to spread up the news cycle. That said, hope those thieves from the Trump admin see at least as much consequence as I want Brinton to get.

Not remotely, since Sam is demonstrably competent and nerdy about very complicated fields of advanced study. But they're also demonstrably showing horrifying lapses in judgement, impulse control, and honesty that does render them unfit for positions of public trust. If it's something that they can treat, awesome, maybe they'll be in a similar position someday, but hot damn I do not need our most prominent genderqueer appointee making us look this bad on the national stage and I won't tolerate a critical member of the DoE exhibiting these behaviors.
Well yeah, but a Patriot system costs $1billion per system, while the S-300 is only $150million. So you can have 6 S-300 systems for the price of one Patriot.... That's not to mention that each Patriot missile costs $4 million per shot.
Yes, but does the added cost give you significant benefits to make it worth it to buy one Patriot system, instead of 6 S-300 systems?
Yes, but does the added cost give you significant benefits to make it worth it to buy one Patriot system, instead of 6 S-300 systems?
Another point to make, is that the Patriot system costs 1billion per system, while an S-400 system is only 300million, with the S-300 only costing 150million... The cost benefit analysis heavily favors the Russian systems.

Well they're basically the same system... S-400's are what they say are more advanced, as they claim they are capable of targeting stealth planes.

The baseline S-300 missiles are out of production in favor of newer S-400 and S-400V variants, the S-300 being 1980s tech at this point. Russian stockpiles are deep though.

Russia claims a lot of thing. If you want an example look at how overyhped the MiG-25 was and how it made the us spent a fortune making one of the best jets in the world, before a MiG-25 pilot landed one in Japan and the US realised it was way worse that what was claimed.

Replacing Biden right now would be a terrible mistake for Dems, especially considering the impressive midterm performance the Dems put up, and the impressive amount of legislation that was passed in the first two years of Biden's tenure.

I do think that one underrated factor here is the 'boring' vibes that Biden gives off, which allows the Dems to pass consequential legislation without inspiring much negative polarization... no matter how hard the GOP tries, they can never successfully portray him as a radical leftist the way they could for Bill Clinton and Obama.
People are the problem here. People are seeing and interpreting the polls the aggregators with their own built in bias and are missing what is actually out there.
More importantly, though, most polling is in no way inaccurate. There are polling organizations that are better than others, but inaccurate polling is usually a choice.

So Dems were getting good internal polling; established pollsters were pretty much on the money; but there were simply so many outfits doing shitty, Republican-favorable polling that it actually badly skewed the overall perception of the race.

When you combine that with two successive elections where the Rs outperformed the polls, leading to a persistent belief that R voters were underrepresented, you had media figures working off averages skewed by bad data that then put their fingers on the scale to further shift the polling right.

If there are ten contests on the ballot, but you think your vote will only matter in one or two of them, it's easier to make excuses about why going through the trouble to vote isn't worth it, even when the ones that would matter are higher offices. Higher offices are further removed from people. You might never see your US Senators or Governor, but could regularly see your mayor, council members, etc. And people might actually care more about the more local offices for that reason, because they're more directly affected by them, even though the higher offices affect more people, and sometimes even to a greater degree.

It doesn't account for all of the problem, but it does account for some of it. It's part of why gerrymandering is so pernicious. Add in all the other forms of voter suppression, disenfranchisement, etc, and they're an interconnected set of weapons, mutually supportive in the goal of helping elect the GOP despite only having minority support. Every form of cheating makes every other form of cheating that much easier and more effective.

These are related problems. The problem of gerrymandering isn't limited to electeds choosing their constituents, which would be bad enough. It's also a form of voter suppression. When you live in gerrymandered districts and know your vote basically won't count, it can make you less likely to feel the need to vote, even for offices where your vote would count and matter.

Yup, I am convincing more and more of my friends and family to go with me to vote for Dems, but when our districts look like a Jackson Pollock painting, it makes it even harder... It does not help that they ran out Beto again. He has no real appeal to drive the young vote....and reiterating his taking your guns comment when he started his run struck fear in the republican base and made sure they would turn out.
Every time I see this anti-voter stance it disgusts me. If your entire "victory" stems on suppressing 70% of the voters for a party then it's not a victory.
Which really brings us to 2028. We have a pretty big gap in acceptable candidates. Call me jaded but I really just want the most disarming boring seeming candidate that can do excellent work while letting the congress hold the focus, as they're supposed to.

Sure some of them could try challenging for it now, and squander all of their resources against an already established president serving only to weaken Biden for the general election. Or they could save those resources and collect money and favors around the country by showing that they can get a coalition of Democrats elected to state and national offices outside of their home state.

I want him to be the nominee right now because we don't have a good field of candidates to run in the primary. There are a handful who might be ready in a few years, but none that would be ready by 2024.

We do not have to wait for 2024. There will be local and state elections in 2023. Start voting out as many republicans as we can now. Vote every chance you get from the school board to the white house every seat we take is one step closer to saving democracy and making progress.

If people start voting in numbers in these off year elections for democrats it would make it more likely people we could vote for would run. Democracy is not one and done.
Eh, a lot of people hate the economy under Biden. It's just that the alternative is an insane party that only stands for Owning The Libs by making things miserable for people.
The supply chain stuff is obviously because of the pandemic (and Trump's response to it), but the infrastructure bill definitely contributed to inflation.

The infrastructure bill does not explain why the entire world is experiencing historic inflation. With or without the infrastructure bill there would be history inflation as evidenced by other countries that had no such government spending bills passed. The only way to prevent the inflation we are seeing today is to have had a better government in the past and have more regulations on corporate greed.

Not perfect of course. But he is restoring credibility to the executive branch after 4 years of utter misfeasance, malfeasance, and nonfeasance from top to bottom during the Trump years. More work is still needed as the damage Trump did to this country will take more than 4 years to undo.

We did not need tax cuts during a raging economy. We did not need to bungle a global pandemic. We did not need to wage a tariff war with China. But we cannot change the past. The infrastructure bill was a necessary evil to invest in the future for the country. That was not something republicans would have ever done and their handling of actual economic and health crisis is proven to end in tragedy over and over.
This is especially true in English where we use compound words, hyphenated phases and space separated phrases interchangeably.
I remember learning in high school that some compound words are separated by a space instead of a hyphen.

The whole silent letters (looking at you: French) is ridiculous and also needs to go. “Drive-Thru”is accepted and no one makes the throaty noise for the end of “through” any more, so might as well save people the three letters. This would demolish written French as we know it, but I want neither of them to be the language of the future (and they are the two languages I know the most).

Many romantic languages has genders applied to nouns, which is aggravating since a chair and a table have no genitals and thus do not need gendered identifiers.

Hi hamsternice101. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
It is. New Year is like a presents and family gathering big day. Christmas on the other hand is purely religious holiday and there are zero presents-related traditions tied with it - there are a very few specific foods some families cook but that's pretty much it.
Most don't even consider that as a holiday - just a free day off work. In fact, Christmas is lower in "tier list" of holidays than Easter. Namely because Easter does have some traditions (painting eggs and going out with family to sort of picnic) which is why more non-religious people actually get involved in celebrations, while with Christmas - unless your family and/or your close circle is religious - no one cares much.

Relatives and some friends in Vinnytsia, colleagues and their families/surroundings in Lviv/Uzhgorod/Mukacheve (which is most western possible), some friends in Kyiv and my whole life in Kharkiv - that's where my experience coming from. St Nicholas day is indeed used for presents (more on west, but east too) but never heard of Christmas presents in Ukraine at all.

New Year's Eve is still the biggest celebration day in Ukraine, as far as I've heard. My family celebrates New Year's and both Christmases, and it's one of the best times of the year. It's a great reason to get together and eat, drink, and celebrate life. Might be different for families who don't like each other as much, though. xD.

Wot? You're making it sound like Christmas was made up only when Christianity moved into central Europe. Christmas was there from the get go, evolving out the Roman Saturnalia and Sol Invictus celebrations. Sol Invictus was literally on December 25th and briefly popular in Rome before Christianity was even legal.
if you mean places like a Cairo or Luxor it's safe but I would suggest you to have some guide with you, you will learn more (stories) about these places with historical perspective.
Go to Luxor, Aswan, Sharm Al Sheikh, Hurghada & Alexandria, these are relatively safe and u will have quite a lot of fun.

Lots of people, way too crowded even for un-touristic spots, scammers everywhere, if you have a camera and tried to take some pictures it will be confiscated by police, just don’t go to Cairo.

Also, while I haven’t been myself, every time I’ve ever listened to someone talk about Cairo, they always claim it’s the worst place they’ve ever been for scammers and street guys harassing you everywhere you go.

Mostly safe on the average for western tourists, but in countries like that you just never know when some shit might go down. Very unpredictable in many ways.

That’s why a guide is recommended. They will shoo those people away from you. The guides you can hire will apparently work very hard for you, I’ve heard they are very dedicated to their jobs and in giving you a good trip. And they work hard for a good tip too.
I doubt U.S. military-engineers are capable of quickly refurbishing Soviet tech when they've been taught to work on US-made vehicles. The Czech Republic and The Netherlands are NATO states, so it's very in-line for what these countries are providing for Ukraine.
NATO was formed to protect NATO members, Ukraine is not a NATO member so i don't quite see the relevance here. Regardless, a lot of NATO countries are helping Ukraine, not just USA.

The US is in the best position financially and militarily to help and aid Ukraine. Who in turn helps solidify the security of Europe. If the war goes well for Ukraine, there will be a big surge of investors and economical boom right around the corner.

Europe is an important ally for the USA. USA is investing this money in Ukraine who in turn is demilitarizing Russia, our "Rival" as they have wanted to be classified. USA has no immediate threats, and can send all these arms and money over as the rate of return on these mean a less threatening Russia who wouldn't be able to project it's power in the near future to their other neighbors. A stable world is ideal for trade, a war at the doorstep of Europe signals threat to everyone in that market.

All the other countries are aiding with what they can. You have to account that most are also bolstering up their own defences since the threat is way closer than it is to the US. So there is military and financial aid that they can't provide if they are preparing.
We have two hypotheticals which require someone to believe that China is objectively more evil than the USA. Because the biggest fear here seems to be control of those semi conductor plants going from Taiwan (aka whatever the USA says) to China. You are assuming an absolutely worst case scenario with China in control when the spectrum is huge. Whereas war with China has 2 options economic destruction with nuclear destruction or just economic destruction, a bunch of dead people(not as many with no nukes), and wasted tax dollars.
Interesting, tell me do any of those consequences sound as bad as nuclear war? What does everyone think will happen if China invades Taiwan and the US declares War on China? The worlds 2 largest militaries and economies go to war and that works out better than China just taking the island?

If China invades, it will be ruinous for the world economy whether America decides to shoot back or not. There is no going back to previously established trade relationships in that event.
I’ve cleaned up after a 2x Molotov attack that did minimal damage. Even if they ignite and break it’s not much fuel. Hot tip: break the window first, you want the Molotov to land and hopefully break near something flammable not on the window sill.
Hopefully they will fuck this plan up as badly as all the others but that’s small comfort for those Ukrainians sacrificing everything for their home and countrymen.

If Ukraine can capture the west bank of the Dnepo (sp?) river, and build a beachhead, they will start moving troops and heavy weapons over immidiatly and try and make a larger pocket to bring over more supplies and troops and equipment. There is risk though, the Russians know they are coming, they may be crazy enough to blow the hydroelectric dam and try and wash away a landing party once enough troops are there, etc. Ukraine on the other hand doesn't have large landing craft to try and attempt a landing on the coast and away from the contested areas, so they don't have alot of geographically feasible options.

I see them keeping a holding force at one or the other front, and trying to sneakily reinforce one or the other long enough to create a decisive force large enough to take a large chunk of territory. I think the more noise they make about an imminent attack is the least likely vector it will come from. A middle of the occupied area push towards Maruipool (sp?) is something I don't think should be ruled out either.
Bad thing. Black history? Just teach normal history and add things to the curiculum. Why does everything have to be racially motivated in the USA? They going to do indian history and hispanic history too now lmao?
I could fire that racism accusation right back at you. There is only one history. By filtering it based on race you just open the door to biases. Education in highschool is for giving people a strong basis. You can extend the curiculum to add more details on the history of african americans but it should be proportional. These kind of subjects are usually taught in college for a reason. If you only teach kids 'black history' they will get a verry narrow understanding of history from just that.

I think they’ve infuriated a lot more than African American Studies Professors. This is a New Coke level fuck up that teachers, principals, parents and high school students will never forget. It would have been smarter just to cancel the course.

They took out “intersectionality” out of AP Black History. I don’t even know how to respond to that. The College Board can go screw. Not really impressed they got on their high horse and tried to scold DeSantis and Florida, they colluded with these fuckos and got caught. Assholes.
Live in Louisville, and I still get people who joke about people not wanting to work due to government hand outs....

There is an odd scenario here. The speaker is elected by the house as a whole from candidates nominated by each caucus. The nominees do not have to be from the same party or even a member. So the democrats could nominate some well respected moderate elder statesman. They would then only have to convince a few moderate Rs to vote 'present' since the vote only needs to be of a majority of those present and voting.

They only need 6 votes from reasonable Republicans and they have a bi-partisan, lesser-of-two evils majority. Plus it'd give the Republicans no excuse to say "they can't get the votes" in appointing someone like MTG.

Maybe Democrats should just vote in a republican speaker who is not crazy instead of all just voting nay lol . Or vice versa there is nothing stopping a handful of republicans voting in a democrat as a speaker right ?
The middle ground of "I want to stab you a bunch" and "I don't want you to stab me" is "I will stab you a little.".
Yup. A good friend of mine does that. Says he has a laundry list of qualifiers about who he's going to vote for. Always votes for the republican, hasn't voted for a democrat in decades. Claims he only chooses the best person for the job. I usually call him out on it because its so freaking stupid.

This is stupid. Given our technology to travel and communicate instaneously, we'd be able to quickly change the living arrangements of citizens if we really needed to. Think of the positive side, the blue states would have universal health care, education, work programs, infrastructure projects, etc.

Yeah, Mr. Trump? We finally found the funds for your wall, but there's a small little fly in the ointment, sure it won't be an issue or anything, the location. It's in finland.
in Finland but not in the US. That was your statement. I was simply pointing out your rather flawed logic and intellectual weakness. Further, anyone who needs to project that racism is the only reason people would want a southern wall and not a northern one really has no place calling any other human a bonehead. I realize you don’t have a lot of tools to work with but perhaps try something different. I don’t believe thinking is your forte’.

Nice way to explain why a wall totally works and makes sense in Finland but apparently in the US the only possible explanation is right wing racism. What a fucking joke. You don’t even pretend at honesty any longer. Just straight up political propaganda. An unsecured southern border to the US is a dangerous, unregulated potential entry point for anyone who would come here for nefarious reasons. The reason there is no Canadian wall is that for the most part, it’s hasn’t been an issue. We simply do a better job and more importantly Canada does and they work with us. The Mexican government is utterly corrupt and in many ways are aligned with and bought by the cartels. We can’t trust that the people being allowed through are safe. But keep lying to yourself and everyone else and keep crying racism as an excuse to oppose anything you simply don’t like. But realize that most people in the mainstream aren’t buying it and think people who hold these views are a little unhinged.

And the fact of the matter is EU is taking a tremendous amount of refugees in -- much greater than the US!

Other western countries take in much larger numbers of asylum seekers. USA is not even in the top 10 for hosting refugees by raw number per country. On a per capita basis we receive ridiculously low numbers.

Often core party Americans select which candidate they support based on who members of the opposing party oppose. I can make the case for Clinton and Sanders. Clinton did extremely well in the primary in states with very small Democrat populations. The vocal anti-Clinton rhetoric gave her a strong majority among Democrats. The effect gave Trump a windfall in Democratic states.
Possible ? Yes. And overworked operator that has to look at a 360p shitty as Black and White feed for 2 hours straight might just miss.

Was there a Russian missile flying towards a Ukrainian target, a Ukrainian operator trying to shoot it down with a counter-missile, and missing? If so, did the Russian missile hit its mark? In other words, was the counter-missile warranted and shouldn't have had its flight terminated - it just missed? If so, why did it miss? If not, was the counter-missile launched without a valid target to defend from? Was it an 'extra', a 'backup', was the operator misguided and launched a counter-missile into the air while there was no Russian missile at all?

There's a scenario where any of the number of systems used failed - there was a false-positive identification of a Russian missile that was never there; the operator launched the counter-missile correctly but something unexpected affected it, etc. This goes back to the main issue for me - there would be no counter-missile launched if there was no aggression of a foreign country that Ukrainians have to defend their lives from.

Even if the missile was fired by Ukrainians as a part of anti-missile defense yesterday, but then strayed for whatever reason, Russia is still to blame - there's a reason Ukraine launches defensive counter-missiles.

Most of the russian missiles targeting west Ukraine isn't fired from russia, they are fired from Belarus.

Had Russians not fired 95 missiles over Ukraine yesterday, Ukrainians wouldn't need to counter them. The war is Russia's fault and responsibility, including any accidents and side effects along the way.

People still died, and if this is truly on Ukraine it is in their responsibility to not shift blame. IF they stand up to it and make an honest push to be better, people will forgive them in no time. But deflecting is honestly as bad as Russian rethoric.
Well, the government is responsible for inflation, unchecked gas prices, record corporate profits and price gouging, military war chest, gun culture and so on.
They know what causes the problem, corporate deregulation and government inaction for profits sake. But the GOP supports these things so the fault has to be pointed at people instead of NOT ENOUGH government being the issue.

One thing that irks me on issues like this is right wingers pretending to be populists criticizing government failures and thus clouding the message. People like Tucker (and Rubio in this case!) play at sounding pro-worker and pro-environment because they can use it to criticize democrats when they are in power, all the while carrying water for the corporations and policies that are actually the direct causes of the problem.

The actual socialists and socialist adjacent people are. But, that may be because they don't mind being ridiculed as socialists, and most of them don't have any tremendous political power to flex.

I didn't say democrats were good on this issue. They are better than Republicans, but that's not to say they are good. My point was that this criticism should come from the left and boosting Republicans making these criticisms isn't productive because they aren't serious about them, and their "solutions" would only make the problems worse.

Rubio clutches fake pearls about an issue his party has far more culpability for. The way people are talking about Buttigieg you'd think he personally under-regulated the industry for decades, nixed proposed updates to the safety infrastructure on behalf of the rail companies and their profits, and sided against rail workers to force them to stop strik-.. okay that last one might actually be worth criticizing the Biden Administration for, but coming from Rubio that's like Jeffrey Dahmer criticizing you for eating red meat.
Yup, entire thing has been. TBH I seen Greenpeace often putting out total bullshit just to fuel outrage as well and it's infuriating. We still need coal for steel production, so we might as well source it locally.
Even though it's to be used for steel production, this coal is still going to be responsible for a shitload of greenhouse gas emissions.

The UK, and europe as a whole, needs to move away from carbon intensive steelmaking in the next decade or two. That will likely mean a shift to steel made from hydrogen reduction. This mine is expected to keep operating until 2049. So it will end up shipping its coal all over the world, to whichever countries are still happy to pump out CO2 by then.

It is bad, if we want to stop importing coal then we should, why are we exporting it if we claim the boats importing coal for us is anti green and needed to be stopped... It's illogical to then do the very thing we said is bad and call it good.

It's also conveniently being setup so 85% of the coal will be exported , this has no logic in being done as it won't be used for its primary purpose and is just for money.

This coal mine is being said to use for steel in the UK but UK Steel has said no it won't be used as they are moving to green alternatives and actually 85% of the coal will be exported which is purely for money and not a requirement to stop using russian coal.

B) there’s support for a backward step to produce coal, 80% of which is expected to be exported and contribute to the carbon output of the UK, against the trend of steel production around NOT using coking coal in its process.
It's bad for a plethora of reasons, most notably for making one's focus on their studies split with a tedious job, which makes it much harder to digest what they're learning. University studies involves what you'll do for the next 40-50 years. Some asshat's business you work at to afford rent just distracts you and burns you out, making success in school and at work both questionable.
I used to run over 10 miles at a time sometimes; now I never exercise because it takes over an hour to get a good workout, and I don't have over an hour after doing everything else for a given day. Having to time yourself when you read course materials and write essays, etc, just stresses you out and affects the quality of your work. College does not go well with a 30 hr+ job; anyone who disagrees either didn't have to work in school or did, but half-assed their schoolwork. Tuition is extortionately high, so it would seem most ideal to make the most of it by not cutting your study time, to not waste the money spent on it.

Most people with advanced jobs don't work in university. They study, attend classes, do internships, participate in societies and exercise 5x/wk. Spending 45% of your waking hours working and 45% doing school is unhealthy and is prone to failure. As an American student, I can absolutely attest to this. And when dorm neighbors (people in other dorms) keep you up till 3 AM? That's why it's so bad to have to work in college, because it both affects your life balance and makes you more vulnerable to delinquent kids who disrupt your ability to rest.

I think the number of hours here on average and if they are in school or not is crucial to determine if this really is a bad thing, right?

I had a job in highschool even part time after school/ weekends, which was not a bad thing and certainly didn’t intrude on my classwork. I think highschool kids getting part time jobs isn’t a bad thing and it helped develop my work ethic/time managenent skills. Same goes for college.

Edit: after reading again, no, it doesn’t mention a demographic of young people working while also studying.

Is this only referencing kids working in universities? I understand being forced to get a job when studying, that makes complete sense, but someone not pursueing higher eduction or a trade and being forced to get a job doesn’t seem like a bad thing.
Pinning this comment to address people's questions and worry around article 5 being invoked in light of the 2 killed in the Polish border town.

NATO will probably respond by moving artillery within striking distance of Russia in neighbouring countries, but juuuust outside of the range of Russian equipment that's being used in Ukraine.

Uh Russia, might wanna put a tighter leash on your artillerymen, this could turn into an international incident faster than a flash fire, and my gut says you don't wanna fuck around with a country that's been preparing for another invasion since WW2.

Rhetoric like this is a double-edged sword - on the one hand, it might have some degree of deterring aggression from Russia; on the other hand, NATO would surely look like cowards if they did nothing after saying something like this.
Hey you getting invaded by your neighbour, the one that promised to never attack you. And NATO persuaded you to give up your nukes for and in return protect you. Whose military are committing atrocities to your civilian populations. You shouldn’t use some of your weapons against them. Because you promised.
I get why you might think that, but mines are at a different level. What is really the difference between a mine and a bomb/artillery shell? Especially in this conflict. The idea is that mines don’t discriminate between civilians and military, well Russia is deliberately firing rockets/shells at civilians. And the civilians that have to deal with the Ukrainien mines are also Ukrainien.

During that summer rain of that "petal mines" fell several times over Donetsk. In the residential areas of the city, that is not controlled by Ukraine since 2014. What were they trying to prevent there that hasn't happened in past 8 years?

That is not a mines that tank would care at all. Even if you drive a car into it, the mine will just damage your wheel at maximum. They are talking about special shells for the artillery, that explode in the air and randomly saw large areas by anti-personnel landmines.

BTW these landmines are anti-personnel, not anti-tank. They're "delivered" by artillery and then fly randomly covering a large area.
If you plug in your car in WV, WY, KY, MO, NE, ND, UT or MT, it's more than likely that it's powered by coal. (those are the states that have 50+% energy production from coal).

"A few weeks ago, Breitbart News — the right-wing, hyperpartisan news site formerly run by Steve Bannon — published a truly galaxy brain column. Editor-at-large John Nolte argued that Democrats have been promoting the COVID-19 vaccine not to save lives but instead to trick Republican voters into not getting the jab.

That has nothing to do with it though. Their production of oil isn't going to be affected by whatever changes they can make to their miniscule consumption of oil.

They do not care. They are all about performative politics. It doesn't matter what they actually achieve, it matters what message they are sending.
Russia does not have a point. They would love to convince as many people as possible that they do, but they don't. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume you're naive. Please don't spread russian propaganda and talking points regarding their murder of 298 innocent civilians.
This is precisely why your insinuation that the judge would be biased and just blame it on russia is so misguided. After MH17 we wanted the truth. To insinuate that because russia is our geopolitical enemy now we could nicely pin this on them, is incredibly disrespectful. If you genuinely believe the downing of MH17 would be used as a political tool you really don't understand the effect it had on the Netherlands.

edit: Now that when you say the Netherlands isn't impartial, you're right. But the parties are the people who died and the people who killed them. Not Russia and Ukraine.

Yeah the thing I’m most worried about isn’t opinions of Russia on the world stage. We all know that logic and fact isn’t really their domain. I’m worried they just see that as justification to escalate to invasion or nuclear strike. Cutting diplomatic ties during a time like this could be very dangerous.

I feel like if we cut all diplomatic ties, Russia might see that as us preparing for war. Or at least as an excuse to preemptively strike while using the aforementioned as diplomatic cover.
Many apartment complexes have charging stations. My complex has level 3 stations that charge an average car in under 2 hours. If a charger is not available for you, you can buy a used hybrid or ICE.
Full lifecycle of batteries is between 300 and 500k miles. After a full battery lifecycle an EV is still between 6% and 20% more energy and carbon efficient than an ICE depending on what the grid uses to charger those EVs. There are numerous studies reporting this.

There's an Engineering Explained video that debunks this. Even if you replace all vehicles on the road with EVs, and make them all charge every day at peak times, it's only 30% more draw than current. If you incentivize people to charge overnight or in the mornings by varying kWh cost based on usage, then the charging overhead needed for entire fleet replacement fits within the current infrastructure. Also realize that refineries take shit tons of power, so if those are not working as much to provide gasoline, then that frees up more electrons for EVs.

I make 50k a year. Definitely not 1%. I just ordered a brand new Bolt. Why? Because my ICE Audi costs 35 cents a mile and I drive 25k miles a year. For the same cost as I'm spending on gas and maintenance, I could simply have a newer more valuable car (my Audi is worth about 6k now after 200k miles) and I can increase my net worth while consolidating my vehicle costs into one payment each month. My charging is free at my apartment. Do you understand that this is only for new cars, and that you will still be able to buy a a used car if you can't afford a new one?

If you absolutely can't charge where you live the answer is wherever people drive with their cars. I rented an EV for a week. I was concerned about charging because where I was staying didn't have a suitable outlet. I ended up charging at the grocery store for a half hour while I was shopping. It was way more convenient than a gas station. Took 10 seconds to plug in and it was ready when I was done.

He's actually swearing in on the Constitution, underneath that will be a photo of his parents, his citizenship documents, and the Superman 1. So he's swearing in on the Constitution plus a few things that have personal meaning to him. But the media is running with the headline that it is just the comic book, because clickbait.

Living in Christchurch, it took months for the aftershocks to settle down and then a year later we had a 2nd quake followed by about half a year of aftershocks. That's the scary thing with quakes the big one could be right around the corner and the after shocks can still bring stuff down.
Earthquakes are weird. They affect structures based on the frequency of the vibration and the building's height. A 6.6 earthquake might not touch a building that is absolutely destroyed by a 5.6 earthquake, even though the 6.6 is so much stronger.

The support for Putin's Russia in Germany comes mainly from three groups: Russian immigrants, Far-right idiots and a few far-left idiots who have not quite caught on that Russia is no longer communist and NATO are the good guys this time.
Its a lot of people age 50+ who seem to have forgotten how bad they felt living in the former DDR (east german region formerly controled by russia) which tend to support Russia/Putin in this conflict and who refuse to believe in most of the atrocities the russian army has committed in ukraine.

They invaded in 2014. You really trying to make the idiotic claim that the unkranian government was the only entity going around killing people at that time and that they decided to kill 4400 of their own forces? You are either one of the dumbest people ever or you are one of the most evil. Simping for Russia when Russia started all of this.

What does one do with those who have more allegiance to Russia than the country they live in? Revoke their citizenship and deport them to Russia? Why live in Germany, or Ukraine, or wherever instead of Russia? These people have a pathway to citizen in Russia.
Given how corrupt some of the police are, an intervention might need them to surrender their guns too. This would be a non-starter for the Haitian government.
Those in power enjoy lifestyles that are otherwise unavailable in Haiti. When they're out, there's no parachute - no real business opportunities, and with a corruption or drug scandal, no new policing opportunities. They'll take territory to force aid organizations to pay them, gather up protection money, and so on. But what they really want is to get their clique back in power, so that they can go back to having their jobs and lives. And if you do find yourself in power or policing, you have to find your own clique, or fall victim to the others.

So, it isn't really a matter of good people and bad people, any more than (for example) the Warring States period was about good people and bad people. It's just an impossible situation. To fix the economy you need to fix instability, to fix instability you need to fix corruption and political violence, but to fix corruption and political violence you need to fix the economy.

During the 20th century, there was a cycle where the United States would train and sponsor various groups in Haiti to try to combat the drug trade, but each used their newly acquired power in turn to become the new drug traffickers.

A heartbreaking failure of public policy to put the fragile sensibilities of people not in school ahead of proper instruction of students to ensure they don’t end up as unwed teenage mothers….
Comprehensive sex education would stop this, providing birth control would prevent this, and abortion should have been an option because I guarantee most of these girls aren't ready for the responsibility of being a mother.

That's so absolutely fucked. These kids shouldn't have their parents pulling them out of class and these people should know abstinence didn't work when they were kids and they should know that sex will happen regardless of whether or not they're taught how to do it safely.

I'd rather they learn about consent and respect and boundaries and contraception and how not to be shitty people rather than just going with "Kids suck so don't have sex and hope everything works out for you after graduation." That just normalizes them sucking.

It's a self-fulfilling prophesy, a lot like "Boys will be boys". If you tell kids it's normal for them to suck they will internalize that. We can't just pray and hope that after highschool they will learn what they need to not suck.

It's interesting, because as it stands, the Anglican Church is...kinda set up like a network of terrorist cells. Each Diocese is independent of the other, and largely free of influence from the Archbishop of Canterbury. There's no Pope to issue edicts that all must follow.
The GAFCON thing is pretty huge, and a big threat to the Anglican church, and they don't appear to being going anywhere - in fact, with normal people leaving the church, only the nutters will remain.

The vast majority of this change comes from people no longer feeling they need to put down 'Christian' just because they were baptised CofE and haven't set foot in a church outside of weddings and funerals since.

It might seem like semantics to a modern ear, but as far as the church is concerned, this is very different.

One Anglican bishop actually called this back on the 60’s when he wrote that a lot of Christian language alienates modern listeners. The idea that Christ “ascended into the heavens” which begs the question, how far “up” did he go?? The mere use of the word “God” which he argued should be halted for a few generations to wash the bad taste out of everyone’s mouths. Essentially, he argued that the church must learn to become relevant to modern people or the hardliners would take over and accelerate its irrelevance to all.
Edit: For clarity I’m saying as far as I’m aware, Australia doesn’t hand out titles, awards or medals to visiting dignitaries like Presidents or Prime Ministers.
Our awards like the Order of Australia aren’t decided by Charles. And even the example of former Japanese president, was awarded the Order last year after they stopped being president.

Dipping Maccas chips into soft serve is weird to some, normal to others. You can have something be weird and not weird to different people.

Honestly, I'd argue everyone else are the weird ones lol. Like honestly, why would anyone give a shit about a medal they didn't actually earn? It's like getting a participation trophy, it's meaningless unless you did something to earn it.

so, the medal is worthless... i wonder how the people who actually merited it for a reason feel about this.

So that makes it basically worthless to get the “honor” and the medal then it seems. Yesterday I saw articles about Zelensky getting “France’s Top Honor established by Napoleon yada yada” when basically it’s like a friendship badge.
If he was on Depreska's payroll then how much of what he delivered Mueller was garbage? And who else was getting paid?
He literally got the job as counter intelligence chief six weeks after Mueller announced the Russia investigation would look into Trump.

At this point, anyone who was either installed in a high position or held any sort of legal oversight position during the Trump years should be investigated. Keep shining the light further and further back into these dark corners, expose the rats and hunt them down, they are traitors to what this nation stands for.

If you want any more example of how thoroughly Russian foreign intelligence infiltrated our government and corrupted our processes, this is it. This guy was paid by Deripaska (i.e. Putin) to give that "investigation" a clean wipe, no matter what it actually found, if they actually bothered to try to find anything in the first place.
Ukraine will be well equipped with Western winter gear, have a cadre of new armor revamped and ready to fight, more stockpiles of Western and Russian munitions, and a motivated, well trained, and experienced force eager to roll up the fascists intruding on their turf.
All you need is to let the frostbite set in on the Russians and for the mud to freeze. Then it's showtime.

Ok so more than once, the Russians have said they’ve capture Ukrainian marines there/landing there. Small groups, like 4 or 6. But I couldn’t ever find Ukrainian confirmation, and folks said too improbable to be believed. Also, the Russians never showed photos of these supposed POWs, and it’s not really Ukrainian MO to keep trying a failing strategy. . .

A. The Kherson offensive took a LOT of troops. They need recuperation of course, but sooner or later they'll be free again. And with all the bridges across the Dnipro destroyed, a lot of them will be free to be deployed elsewhere.
The bureaucracy made it so that not even those at the very top had absolute power. Every leader after Stalin had subtle checks on their power. Khrushchev was tossed out for his apparent weakness in the Cuban Missile Crisis and his controversial De-Stalinization shit.
You can say a lot of things about the Soviet Union, but it really wasn’t a kleptocracy like Russia is today. Stalin didn’t institute 5 year plans just to kill all those people and enrich himself and all his pals. He had a genuine interest in building Soviet industrial power, obviously at the expense of millions of lives.

You're not being too outlandish though, obviously the soviets contributed a huge amount to the war. I think people got so sick of people on reddit claiming that the USSR did 99% of the work during the war that they're pushing too far in the opposite direction again.

Just my point is that it's the media trying to paint Russia red while its being a warmongering shithole, associating it with Communism again.

Also Putin is a perfect example of the remnant of Soviet propaganda still causing issues today. Putin is 70 years old and was already a kgb foreign intelligence officer stationed east Germany, so Theres no surprise that when it collapsed kgb got to power which paved his road to where he is today.

You're miss remembering, the quote is far worse. He said in a speech that the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.
Their entire political strategy since 2016 has relied on social media and their ability to influence voter sentiment.
There is not a single shred of good faith (or constitutional alignment) to the cries about free speech coming from Trump/Musk/MAGA.

On the right, "free speech" tends to mean freedom from speech, specifically any speech that contradicts conservative beliefs.

For example a conservative may declare that "Freedom of speech" means they get to drive gas cars and watch TV shows without gay characters and that's just how they define it. There is absolutely no coherent meaning behind that definition. All their words are just noise they make which they mutually understand as "feel good noise".

"Free speech" will mean whatever they want. It doesn't even need to make sense within the context of "free speech".

They say “free speech” but what they really mean is take away everyone else’s free speech rights. Everyone already has the right to free speech. You don’t have the right to say anything you want wherever you want though because all of the non-public places owned by others have a right to free speech too which includes what can and can’t be said on their property.
But the biggest reason might be mere necessity. Republicans can't seem to settle on one of their own here.
He won in a conservative district, he's on the blue dog coalition, and he's a veteran of several wars. Seems like we'd be able to get five or six Republicans to go that way. Or at least several abstentions, and three Republicans to vote for him.

Yes, the Speaker decides the chair but the majority of seats will still be Republican. And no the Speaker doesn’t have the unilateral power to just remove Republicans off committees and force them onto one other. Each party using their own individual House Steering and Policy Committees pick the seats on the committees in proportion to each parties seats. Chairs would be Democratic but powerless since Dems will still be in the minority on committees.

That has happened before. In 1856 the House voted to change the rules to vote in a speaker by plurality instead of a majority after 133 failed ballots.

What do you mean committee assignments? Even if a Democrat becomes Speaker Republicans will retain majorities on committees since they still have the most seats. Those Republicans who hypothetically flip will not be willing to flip when it comes to committees.
Then un-automate the process. If this requires charging people to upload video then so be it. Youtube isn't the preferred video platform anymore because most people who post videos get hit with DMCA trolling like this.

When 64% support overturning elections, I wouldn't call that a rebuke—that's nearly a supermajority among republicans.

Only 18 out of 50 republicans in the Senate voted against the VP having the right to overturn election. That's pretty damn troubling, but instead of the headlines being "32 republicans support overturning elections," they're: "Senate GOP rebukes Trump with Electoral Count Act.".
I figured it was before he was out. Obviously it doesn’t have any bearing on his orientation. I just thought it was funny because he’s lied about so many things and then it comes out he used to be married to a woman.
ETA: given that this guy lies about everything, I suppose I should say I've seen pictures of George and the guy that's purported to be his husband. Who the hell knows if they're actually legally married.

I barely care about this guy but I've seen a bunch of pictures of him with his husband so that's not at all true. He's about 5 in shorter than George and Latino in case you don't believe me.

I've read a few anecdotes about people stopping by his office yesterday trying to find him and it was closed up. If he does have a staff they were making a serious effort to stay out of sight. He had a freaking shame moat around him and no one would get within 3 ft of him if they could help it. He looked miserable, which I really enjoyed.

His mother was a caregiver for elderly people and he stole checks from her clients and fraudulently cashed them. That's why he had to leave the country quickly. And he was married to a woman in Brazil, lol.
A Russian missile aimed at Ukraine was destroyed by Ukraine's air defense system. The debris went to hit Poland.
This should not obscure the fact that Russia is sending dozens, if not hundreds, of missiles every day into Ukraine targeting civilian populations to instill a sense of terror.

Irrelevant, if confirmed it would mean there was no attack on NATO member, not that article 5 would have been invoked even if it was Russian missile, people who say it should are either crazy or get aroused watching combat footage.

This time, it looks like it wasn't Russia so it's good that Article 5 wasn't invoked, but we've all been nervously watching the situation and wondering when it would turn into a full blown war. This missile strike could easily have been the spark that began a NATO-Russia war.

And Russia is the root cause of why those air defense missiles were shot off. Russia is to blame here, not Ukraine.

It’s propaganda to blame Ukraine. The blame solely rests on Russia, even if the missiles were Ukrainian. The missiles wouldn’t have been fired in defense if Russia weren’t invading a sovereign nation.

This is propaganda designed to turn people against Ukraine so that the US and UN can negotiate for Russia to end the war and steal part of Ukraine.
The funny thing is that the vaunted Russian anti-aircraft weapons either don't work very well or are non-existent. You'd think that Engels Air Base where all those nuclear bombers that were firing cruise missiles would have a decent anti-aircraft defence.
They were all correct hypersonic missiles currently have no defense is what I was saying. I described their characteristics exactly how they function unless you can provide me with an article that proves me wrong. But from what I remember that is exactly how they function and I have yet to find anything that details otherwise.

It's pretty much The Handmaid's Tale now, with the persecutions of trans parents and their kids. People are fleeing my state in droves, as well as Texas. All my teacher friends are thinking of leaving for New Mexico and elsewhere. It's too insane in the Sooner State.
They hate on teachers to run the teachers off. They know what they are doing is discouraging teachers from staying in the field. They want them to run away. It's all part of the Republican plan. Look up Christopher Rufo. He's the guy who came up with the Critical Race Theory panic. He admits that he is only doing this to set up his Christian nationalist camps, where he will force kids to be Christians or be expelled from society.

Teachers already are having to sacrifice their plan periods due to severe staff shortages, and now they are going to be giving up lunch.

One would think so, but in Arizona teachers often have to work during lunch to supervise students. My last year in the classroom, I had a schedule that required me to work up to 6 hours without a single break to go to the bathroom.
>“Morocco has had enough of double standards,” Abdelmajid Fassi Fihri, of the Istiqlal Party, told AFP. He deplored the fact that the European Parliament had not condemned attacks on press freedom in Algeria.
Except the EU has called out Algeria on its deteriorating freedom of press conditions several times in the past. "It's double standard/but what about that other country, they do it too" is usually just a way from the country in question to deflect.

Notice how Morocco doesn't even deny it, they're just angry that they were put in the spotlight. Typical for authoritarian regimes i guess. Don't fall for their propaganda tricks.

Sure, but while there are like 10-15% of the nation's judges who are authoritarian wingnuts whose only consistent rule is "my side should win", the other 85-90% of judges and lawyers still operate on the letter of the law and precedent.
The only question is whether the regular legal professionals of the world will actually consider anything a reactionary judge decides as actual precedent, or just sigh pretend it never happened. For their sanity, I reckon they'll keep doing the second one.

I'll just sue him for serving crappy omelets at the omelet bar at Mar a Lago. I've never been there, but I'm sure _someone_ has gotten food poisoning ... I heard about it from a guy who got it from a website. So it has to be true.

Yes there is. It's government assistance not a public good no matter how much you try to equate the two. Which means the public wants means testing applied to it instead of just giving it universally to all borrowers. Forgiveness with no income limit or debt caps was unpopular and not the political win for Dems you assume it would be.

At the same time Republicans are suing because loans are being partially forgiven AND that the forgiveness isn't a high enough dollar amount. Fucking hell.
I mean, wouldn’t that actually be pretty believable that weather patterns would send balloons off course around the same time? That doesn’t seem implausible at all.
I suppose anything is possible. We live in a very violent universe and we would almost certainly be from the same universe so a alien species capable of interstellar travel but that also has no concept of violence would be highly highly unlikely I would say.

If an alien craft is robust enough for interstellar travel and atmospheric entry/exit at will then I don't think man made explosives are taking it down. This is more spy stuff my peoples.

Also they wouldn't need to enter our airspace to learn how violent humans are therefor an alien craft that does breach our airspace that doesn't anticipate violence from humans would also be highly unlikely I would think.

I mean, if they've done any research on us there's a decent chance they'd know we tend to shoot down unidentified craft due to internal conflict with eachother, and as such that flying around without identifying themselves carries that risk. Do you think aliens would be likely to let other unknown aliens fly around in their space without identifying who they are or what they are doing? I'd assume not.

I doubt it. It would have to be an agency with a CONUS clandestine mission, and there are very few of those, because IIRC it’s not legal to spy domestically. If it was normal, like an experiment of some kind, then FAA would know.

Russia is an interesting possibility, given at least the one in AK is not sophisticated, which tracks with what we know about Russian equipment thanks to Ukraine.
For anyone playing along at home, this is more about the Tories billionaire donors. All those russian oligarchs, whose unsanctioned children have massive uk property portfolios have been in their ear telling them the way to do things, then these donors go and make demands of politicians.
This is on the tories who have been turning a blind eye for decades to all of that money stolen from the Russian people that they oligarchs keep donating to the party coffers.

Compared to the well-documented and reported actual corruption of the Tories with regard to the steady stream of Russian money and influence on the party and British politics as a whole... it's a rounding error.

Remember, Johnson was pathologically incapable of doing the right thing, and still made a large contribution in govt to Ukraine in spite of his near-direct connections to the Russian state and his glad acceptance of Russian influence in British politics for several years.

It's interesting you linked sources that support Corbyn in your denigration of him. Someone on the back benches giving ideological interviews to outside orgs isn't the same as that person leading a cabinet of (necessarily) diverse viewpoints.

It's likely he would have embarrassed us a bit by being slow to aid Ukraine, but calling him a Russian stooge is a bit much.
You don’t actually change the pronunciation, it’s just to closer transliterate the Arabic since the original word doesn’t exactly have a K sound. I explained more in another reply to the top-level comment.
So the question is, since English doesn’t even have that sound, do you “simplify” it to English speakers by writing it as a K (generally the older way of doing it), or do you go for a more “faithful” transliteration by writing it as a Q (what’s usually done nowadays)? Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language. The glottal stop is often ignored in romanization because some languages basically treat it as “not a real sound”, and I think that’s stupid, personally.).

Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language. The glottal stop is often ignored in romanization because some languages basically treat it as “not a real sound”, and I think that’s stupid, personally.).
Yes. There are exceptions to the rule, but I find the majority of Islamic centric countries are against freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom from faith. Sharia law and its implementation is a sickness that effects almost every majority Muslim country.

Quranists (those who only follow the Quran) are heavily persecuted in all Muslim-majority countries. Many don’t regard them as “true Muslims” or refer to them as apostates.

To go a step beyond this, I could also claim something else that may shock you but Muslims actually don't actually worship the prophet. Ask anyone and they will say they worship god, not Muhammad. To put Quran on an equal pedestal as Hadith and to claim all muslims value both equally is wrong too. It's a huge blanket statement. There is a huge disparity in the muslim religion when it comes to this and as I mentioned it's very much something that is personal, traditional and familial. When muslims pray together you have no idea which hadith the other believes in or does not. Religious scholars have been debating the value of many of them and trying to verify them. It's something that is actually encouraged and done daily so to say that if you don't believe in a Hadith you will be persecuted is again just another huge blanket statement.
I thought everyone was anti-slavery these days (in the first world). I don’t see anyone campaigning on bringing it back in, for example. I guess to call it a conservative position is potentially disingenuous, but I’m open to being explained why I am wrong.
Totally understand, I wasn’t trying to say anyone was wrong at all, I just didn’t see anyone publicly advocating slavery (but I definitely see what people are saying about it having evolved into something more systemic and insidious). Cheers!

I was hoping for an explanation, never asked for it to be succinct. But thanks for the short version, still helpful. I guess I just thought slavery wasn't anyone position these days, but maybe some secretly want it back (would make sense).

Sorry wasn’t trying to be rude, but there is a clear and visible correlation between the history of slavery, and Institutionalized racism. in our current climate it’s a vein that conservatives have tapped into to garner support.

Instead of using recourses to improve communities, we spend resources on imprisoning people for free labor aka slavery and guess what, the majority are black.

We still have slavery, it’s just hidden behind a corrupt system that systematically targets minorities and marginalized groups.
Congressmen and Senators should be definitely banned from trading stocks, and the ban should be taken a step further and prohibit any family members from trading in stocks related to the committees of the members they're related too.
I'm not defending it because I do think they should be banned from trading individual stocks (index funds I'm fine with and blind trusts should be mandatory), but so it's not like they're doing any of their stock investing in secret, it's quite easy to see what legislation is being debated and is going to come up for a vote, often months to years in advance of it happening. I also think the reason Congress tends to do better in the market then the average "investor" is the average investor isn't as clued into current economic trends, Congress has to be as it's part of their job. So it's not like most congresspeople are doing anything that is nefarious because it's all out in the open, more so than everyone else simply because they have more strict individual reporting requirements (well, not as strict as actual financial institutions).

That said, it's important to separate actual crimes of insider trading (which are already investigated by the SEC and FBI) and violations of the STOCK Act (which is mostly just a reporting law requiring more frequent disclosure of investments). In the case of STOCK Act violations I think they need to drastically increase the punishment, which right now is only a few hundred dollars, to instead be a sizable % of the amount they invested but didn't report on time.

It won't now because the GOP is in the majority. While a few Democrats opposed it in the last session to the point it couldn't be brought to the floor for a vote, all Republicans opposed it, any calls from the GOP now about it are disingenuous.
But that's a win for the EU and Ukraine. Russia issuing passports in Crimea in the name of another land is admitting that they don't have the authority to issue passports in Crimea's name. This is not a "sanction" against Russia, but rather the EU saying "I don't think you own Crimea, so this passport you issued in a foreign Ukrainian city doesn't make any more sense to me than if you said it was done in Barcelona or Berlin".
This is what the EU is saying: The "new Russian territories" are Ukrainian land, so Russian authorities doing anything "official" there don't have any more authority, in the eyes of the EU, than a random dude claiming his house is a country. A passport expedited by Russia in Kherson, according to the EU, hasn't been expedited by a competent authority of the city, so for all they care it's a forged one.

For Crimea Russia used to issue passports with "issuer: Krasnodarsky Krai" (a neigbouring Russian region) instead of "issuer: Republic of Crimea", that's how EU can't distinguish passports from legitimate Russian ones.

Here the passport is deemed illegitimate because the country issuing them (Russia) is giving them to people who aren't Russian. It's what I understood anyway.

I think people already understood the situation. Those legitimate Ukrainians need to get refugee status, after all, they are at war. EU cannot accept Russian passports from the region cause of national security issues should be very understandable.

Honest question here : how many times does Musk uses his private jet himself compared to the amout of times his jet would fly without him... Because the reasonable expectation would be that if he has a private jet, he would be using it himself and thus tracking his private jet would equal to tracking him.

Musk is a public figure and all jets have flight plans that are public records. Let me ask you, are you listed in a telephone directory? Even if not your residence is in a directory somewhere. Public records are just that. Public. If someone wants to attack Musk the records are out there. Even if someone knows what city Musk is in they won't know where.
2. Within a year, she began to suffer what sounded like severe domestic violence from her Sri Lankan boyfriend and the allowance from her family stopped coming. Since she can't pay for tuition, she got expelled and lost her visa status by June 2018.

Damn near happened to me in the US. Damn cop got his fingerprints all over the evidence. I had to do the cops' investigative work for them, hire a detective and public defender out of pocket (a friend who liked playing cat and mouse with the cops gave me a specific recommendation). Spent 8 months proving my innocence. The attorney almost didn't want to take my case because I was innocent, but he gave me a 50% discount. The victim, a local government official, told me I should sue the county, but I was emotionally tapped out.
Videos in the years before the invasion show Russia using western precision rifles to engage Ukrainians. Oddly enough it was funny to see how well put together that small Russian team of soldiers were compared to what we are seeing now.
Not really sure how much combat footage there is on the sub right now showing Russian SOF this well kitted or even shooting western precision rifles much at all. I frequent combatfootage as well as other subs and sources to find footage and don't see much of it at all, would be harder to find as i don't think Russian SOF teams aren't letting as much footage see the light of day at this time.

There’s plenty of Russian sabotage & recon teams out there, not sure why you think it isn’t happening just because it’s not mainstream news. Plenty of combat footage and telegram reports of these kinds of operations, even shows the sniper rifles being used.

It takes away from what Ukrainians have faced and accomplished because there’s probably a lot of conventional forces and territorial defense who had to battle Russian special forces due to their frequent use in direct action roles.

While the it's true that the Ukrainians did the actual fighting, NATO supplied anti tank weapons to Kiev before and during the first days of the invasion.

Dude your going on a guy saying there was more videos before, and then you say, there was more videos before 😁You have to look harder😁.
Ukraine wants the German Leopard 2 tank. Germany should supply it. It is better for Ukraine to get the Leopard 2 rather than the US M1 tank because the Leopard 2 uses diesel which is what the Ukrainian tanks use.
A tank company of Leopard 2s will require 3 fuel trucks to fully refuel. The exact same is needed for a company of M1 Abrams. They will refuel at the same distance, and refuel at the same interval. The fuel trucks of the Leopard 2s will have some fuel remaining, but not anything worthwhile.

The ability to run literally anything in it for fuel, from jet fuel, to gasoline, to diesel, to heating oil, to kerosine, would actually be a nice bonus to Ukraine, where tankers could simply pillage whatever fuel there is in the area to keep running, vs requiring purely diesel that may not be available in the area and leaving their supply lines vulnerable to attack.

The fuel usage is grotesquely overrated by people who don't comprehend the basic figures they're looking at. It burns through far more while idle, but the difference when actually running is only around a 30% increase.
Since this was declared a victory, their first advance in a while, I guess this throwing 500 bodies a day tactic will continue.
Throw in the Wagner vs Russian army disputes which results in an apparent lack of Russian army artillery cover/counter artillery for Wagner troops and it gets worse.

It’s seems the small town of soledar was taken by sending bodies at Ukraine’s defences until a weak point was found. This lost a lot of untrained troops, but Russia has got their bodies into Soledar and declared a victory. The Russians there are under drone surveillance and artillery fire, so it’s still a dangerous place to be.

Yeah. The Ukrainian public is not happy about the pretending to be civil, legal (ie arrest) then simply murder on the street soon after, which is obviously not justice, and not even permitted in war. They want to know if SBU has been doing this, and how often, and how many times basically got it wrong.
This bill doesn't require churches or people of faith to participate in any way, shape, or form of a same sex marriage. A same sex couple getting married has ZERO effect on these people's lives. This all about forcing their religion on the rest of the populace. Therefore why are people of faith in need of protection? Absolutely illogical and insane.
Edit: This shit just makes my blood boil. I cant stand the mental gymnastics that goes on in the heads of people on the right. They think that if other people don't conform to their religion's ideology that somehow their religious freedom is being infringed. Un-fucking-real.

In her case I think she might genuinely be afraid of the consequences of letting gay people get married. She's lived in terror of a vengeful God all her life. She probably things the USA will quite literally get sucked into hell if she allows gay marriage.
California has experienced rolling blackouts in the summer but never have i heard about blackouts in the winter and certainly not protracted ones. If thousands of people had to frequently heat their homes with cooking stoves, that would be major news. How often have your family had to do this in the last 10 years? You write as if this is a real fear, so make clear how often this need occurs.
While pipes can break from frost, this doesn’t happen to indoor pipes as easily as you suggest. Its only anecdotal but I’ve had a break in an unheated part of my house only once in 20 years. Its been 30 since I’ve experienced a blackout. And key to your comment, a gas stove in the kitchen would not provide the heat needed to keep pipes from breaking.

I had a glass top electric stove and I learned that if you have nothing on another burner just keep the other side on the temps needed.

Now, in my own house, I invested in a induction stove and am at least as happy as with gas. It reacts fast, spilled milk doesn't burn in and the glass surface is easier to clean than the gas stove. Would never accept anything else again.

I grew up with a gas stove and loved it. When I had my first own appartement with an conventional electric stovetop I wasn't even able anymore to cook spaghetti without making a mess because I was so used to the quick response of gas.
Yeah, it doesn't track even a little. Even setting aside the unconstitutionality of it, most of the high authority of sheriffs was legally gone at the end of the English Civil War (Civil administration replaced a lot of previously royal prerogatives) -- which preceded the American Revolution by 120 years.
There isnt really a tradition that should have carried over in American common law, such as precedents or case law, since England hadn't been doing it for more than a century.

The funnest part is that the power they claim they have isn't even derived from the US Consitution, which doesn't mention sheriffs or their powers once. Their whole thing is a bad reading of common law, because at one point in medieval times, sheriffs had some of these powers.

Sheriffs were used to create and enforce feudalism in early England. Rural lands were often common lands, shared amongst the egalitarian populace. Private land property was not a well flushed concept in those areas.

Yup. It's very interesting that modern Sheriffs departments are often tasked with executing evictions even still.
Well one day he said that he had won the congressional medal of honor. Well, the other regular sitting next to him snapped and was like "You've never won the CMH, only x amount of people have ever won that medal and you aren't one of them". This other regular was generally a quiet guy so we were all taken aback by his outburst. The next day he showed up with a printout of every CMH recipient but the liar never ever showed back up again and he had been going to that bar for years.
I was just telling this story the other day but I bartended in a place that had a regular. He was certainly wealthy and was good for a $100 tip no matter the amount of his bill. He was a nice enough guy but would constantly tell the most outlandish lies. Some hits of his were he was a former professional baseball player, his wife was Miss Georgia in the early 80's, he invented the palm pilot for Casio, he was a guitarist for the Eagles Etc. Etc. Etc.

Ok. So, we have established that he is a pathological liar. Can we just ignore him now? He's in congress, there is nothing we can do. Ignore him. Pointing out his lies at this point is just redundant.
This isn’t a game. It doesn’t matter at all if your neighbor who never votes reports to hate Republicans and support all sorts of wonderful progressive policies. They are part of the problem not as much a part of the problem is people who actively vote against those things, but a smaller and very tangible part of the problem of politics in the country.
They matter for political issues because they are potential voters meaning the "why" of the abstaining from voting matters. It can even be - and has been - a political goal to motivate people not to vote.

You seem to mainly wish to express your dislike of non-voters. The relative virtuousness of voting vs abstaining is not so interesting to me. I simply wish to clarify that political discussions simply have to include the general public, not just those who vote. Minors, who aren't allowed to vote, also clearly play a big role in political discussions. And that's because, again, politics and society in general are not separate entities.

In addition; and more generally, society does not exist apart from some segregated realm of politics. Both are heavily intertwined and impossible to separate. What happens in the political sphere leaks out into the cultural, social, economic etc. spheres and those in turn impact political agendas. So of course those who don't vote still have impacts and are impacted by politics.
It just struck me because I was like… “yeah, I’d just defect. Show up all white flag and hands up, be like I got fuckin sent here by that moron but he didn’t realize I’m just gonna use it as an escape, here’s some of our trash equipment”. Ukraine understands their foes are all conscripts, if someone’s immediately just like “fuck Russia, I’m out” and hasn’t done anything to them, they’re not going to hate you because “Putin forced me” is a fairly relatable problem for them. But better to make Putin think you’re dead for your family’s sake. Something Ukraine would also know, so I’m sure falsely reporting defectors as casualties would be a plan.
So while Ukraine is very likely overstating the Russian losses, 100,000 casualties isn't an accurate number either.

It's very strange and deeply sad to see Russian soldiers dying in such enormous numbers, with so many of those due to injuries the US obsessively worked to make survivable a decade ago. They've been taken by corrupt and abusive men, transformed into rapacious villains and sent to die without the most badic protections, and for fucking what?
That being said, Trump's presidential announcement couldn't have been placed at a worse time and was met with crickets. He didn't energize anybody and has exactly zero momentum. I imagine he's hoping to recreate his bullying the other candidates in the primary debate stage thing. Who knows if that works twice though.
I think we need some primary polling. DeSantis polls well against him amongst GOP voters, but are the people that want DeSantis people that will show up to primaries? IDK. I feel like the red in their bones Republicans still like Trump and they're the ones that vote in the primaries.

As for why...... it because the GOP voter base really hate the 'rinos' and are 'done' with the neo-political system. They will continue to throw Trump like a Molotov cocktail.

Yeah, autocrats also usually hate intelligent people / intellectuals and try to repress them because they pose a threat to their rule. They need people to be stupid, unmotivated sheep so they can stay in power.
This is legitimately one of the reasons why autocracies are almost always shit holes compared to democracies. Creative and talented people inevitably feel repressed and choose to leave. Also see: Einstein.

That’s how autocracies lose to democracies. Most of the smart people collectively make the smart choice en mass, which is in itself a form of democracy.
None of the things you listed were unconstitutional or illegal. Even Citizens United is a well reasoned decision that was a natural extension of our first amendment precedent/expansion. Your disagreement doesn’t make it different. The dissent is well reasoned as well. Law isn’t a hard science with only one correct result.
That doesn’t specifically grant this right. Congress actually passed a bill SPECIFICALLY for PPP at the time. Lawyers on Reddit must have nightmares reading through these comments.

Well, luckily, that will be decided by the courts and not a bunch of redditors wanting out of their debt they signed up for in order to get a foray into higher education.

Student loan forgiveness was an action by the executive branch. Student loan forgiveness was not voted on in congress. I am aware you think the HEROES Act gives them that authority. I hope you don’t get your hopes too high, for your sake. Anyway, God bless and have a great rest of your week.

He certainly has an opinion. Here’s the opinion of third in command, House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. “People think that the President of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress”.

An act of Congress already approved this. Providing assistance to borrowers after disasters was literally what the HEROES act of 2003 was written for.

Student loan debt forgiveness is being argued under the HEROES Act of 2003. It was unanimous in both Houses, as a post-9/11 response, and was made permanent in 2007. To get the relief, all a borrower has to do is fill out a form confirming that they borrowed money. There’s no requirement to show a degree, no requirement to show a career in the field of said degree. There’s no demonstration necessary that any attempt at repayment was made, and the forgiveness goes out to anyone who made less than $125k individually in 2020 or 2021. You don’t even have to demonstrate that you faced any economic hardship during the pandemic.
It's the non partisan polls that people should pay attention to. There have been too many right leaning pollsters just putting out poll after poll of Republicans in the lead only for a non partisan poll to come out showing the Democrats in the lead.
But non partisan pollsters do a better job of following George Gallop's quota system unlike right leaning pollsters. An example of this is Insider Average(?) a right leaning pollster did a poll of PA after the debate that showed Oz up by three, the problem is that only fourteen percent of respondents were young people who made up twenty-five percent of the electorate in 2018 and twenty-eight percent in 2020 in PA, and it didn't have enough black respondents as well.

Yes, because you want to make sure your team wins. If people see their guy down by five or six, people might not see the point in voting for a candidate that they don't think can win anyways.

Seriously, if even 5% of this sub got 1 person to vote, who otherwise wouldn’t have voted, then that’s over 400,000 votes, which is crazy.

Like you pointed, I also think polls became more "reactionary", in that they tend to capture people who want their opinions to be heard.

Imo even the non partisan polls are not great, and the issue is poling is becoming a lot more difficult (or not having biased polls). In the past, you could opened a phone book and randomly called people, everyone had a landline and 95% would have responded since there was no way (or a very limited way) of knowing who was calling. Having long phone conversations was a usual part of life, so you could conduct detailed surveys and a series of follow up surveys.

Yeah many top tier pollsters to a mixture of polls and blend the results using model that they predict to reflect the populace. But again the models are mostly based on past elections and the census, and could cause inaccurate weighing of the results. For example, you might be responding more to surveys at a ratio of 60% to 40%, but based on past elections and the census, the surveyor might think it would be close to 50-50 during the elections and adjust the results by weighing woman less . Well... it might turn out to be 60-40 during the election as well.
With all respect to zelensky though, it’s not necessarily even our fight against Russia at all. From my understanding too, sanctions and shit have already been in place for a while, we can tell Russia this isn’t okay but NATO and the US or whatever else is going to keep wanting to press the buttons and push it until it’s now Russia vs USA from instigating back and forth nonstop.
Yeah you're missing a lot of context but Ukraine wanted into NATO (to protect against Russian aggression) but Russia said it was a red line for them (since they were planning to take Ukraine since before 2014) so in order to placate Russia NATO denied Ukraine membership. Then Russia invaded in 2014. The world looked the other way and again tried to appease Russia until they invaded again in 2022.

As for it not being NATO's fight, I suppose it's not technically. But the last time the western world just let an adversarial European nation run roughshod over allied European nations was in the 1930s when Hitler started annexing countries left right and centre. Pacification only encouraged Hitler to take more and more. Thankfully Western countries didn't let it happen this time around.

Surely you believe that there is more the west could do that wouldn’t trigger widespread unrest. Or is it your opinion that the west is so close to widespread collapse that individuals making the personal choice to travel less and use less fuel will trigger mass rioting?

Millions of people are displaced and hundreds of thousands are dead and we are still traveling for the holidays and enjoying nice toasty homes. The West’s aid is very high, but the west’s sacrifice is very low.
Now, personally I think this is all bullshit. Prior to the last couple elections this idea of such widespread conspiracy and corruption swaying the vote is a novel concept and unprecedented. We’ve gone almost 250 years, election results used to be handwritten and delivered on horseback but now all of a sudden in the age of cameras and fingerprint scanners someone found a way to cheat the election.
They believe elections have the potential to be corrupted. So they will argue we should have as few opportunities as possible to screw with the election, that we should restrict voting to only the most secure of methods.

As others have pointed out, it’s specifically to tilt elections on republican’s favor, since more people voting means they do worse.

It's a way to limit the ability of poor people to vote, with the presumption that rich people are republicans while poor people are more likely to be democrats.

But a broader point here is that so-called “voter id laws” always include other provisions like this to suppress ways democrats tend to vote. The objection to these laws isn’t merely the use of an ID, it’s mostly the other ways these laws are designed to hurt voters.
A Nation is A People, not People. There is both a specificity and an immortality to a nation that people do not possess. This is not the counter argument you think it is. Nations are defined by the common language, heritage, and traditions of its members, not the members individually.

Question: isn't sanctioning them until they conform to our preferred norms the same thing as imposing our ideals on them? You want to claim an anti-colonial stance, but economic imperialism ultimately has the same aim and effect.

Furthermore, you are right about economic imperialism. This is a classic lose-lose situation. Ignoring human rights issues, awful. Forcing your ideals on another society also wrong and ineffective. However to say we have to keep a morality out of a moral issue is just silly. As you said trading is our prerogative and having to continue trade in order to appear to not have a moral agenda spits on that idea. Sanctions the things that give the Taliban power but not the things people need to survive such as water, food, clothes, medicine etc.
I was daydreaming about this today. Please, Donald, use that ridiculously inflated ego of yours to run as an Independent who siphons off the DeSantis vote.
You and I had the exact same thought The idea of trump running as a 3rd party candidate to pull votes away from Desantis just gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.

My big question is if DeSantis runs in the presidential race, will he garner more support than Trump? Or is he so similar that he won't have national appeal? He's currently feuding with Trump last I heard, but he also aligns with Trumpism in a lot of ways. I wonder if national voters would reject DeSantis as vehemently as they are rejecting Trumpism in the midterms.

I think many voters reject Trump specifically because he’s insane in the membrane. Even apolitical people got tired of him constantly wanting attention. DeSantis is less off the rails than Trump, and he’s got good PR/advertising people working for him, so I think he could get independent votes.

Not surprising DeSantis won by a huge margin since we’ve been getting inundated by DeSantis ads since July or August, with barely nothing from the Crist campaign. Seems like the DNC gave up in Florida.
Yeah, another one of those headlines asking a question where the answer should be "no," but this is apparently the best plan people in charge could come up with. Of course.
"Let's throw more responsibilities at an underfunded without any additional money, and make sure to get as many police involved as possible. Hey, it worked great for our public schools, right?".

Or. Or. Or. maybe we should just send the cops to take the ones who survive their first encounter with the cops off to jail so we don’t have to see them anymore. That would be on brand.

Maybe the solution is building a comprehensive welfare state with a functional public health system that can get people housed and in treatment programs that will hopefully help them stabilize, find employment, and participate in society.

100%. Could have let it fuck off in to the ocean and never worried about it. But Republicans were losing their minds over it, Biden called their bluff, and then we find out this has happened before.
I'll bet his little feels are hurt that Biden didn't telegraph to him that Biden was waiting to do it without risking any people getting hurt.

After railing against China for years, Trump told an audience there that he didn't blame them for taking advantage of the US.

The same thing happened during the Trump years, and Trump government didn't shoot down those Chinese balloons back then. Why? Do the Republicans have any explanation for that?
All the points you made certainly hurt the Republicans, but they still lost a lot of winnable seats by running super unpopular candidates. What is maybe more important is that these candidates are all in a social media pissing contest on who can get in a twitter fight with AOC and make the next news cycle. So they are incentivized to be as loud and publicly crazy as possible.
Expand the courts! The reason cases take years is that the judiciary is absurdly understaffed and backed up, so it would be practically and politically good.

The smartest political move Kemp has ever made was not going down with the Trump election denier ship and beat a strong candidate in Abrams.

Which would baffle me because Kemp obliterated Stacy Abrams in the same election. If the election was stolen, how did Kemp win over Abrams then? Wouldn't the dems want to steal the governor position too, not just a senator?

I think a very visible international trial for war crimes would do the rest of the world quite a bit of good. Shooting her in the face might be fair justice, surely, but a protracted show of international condemnation would be so much better for everyone (except Russia, of course, but they'll bitch and whine and lie like they always do anyways so who cares?).
Yep. Sometimes the best posture is defence. Ukraine has depleted a huge amount of Russia’s best troops and equipment. They aren’t coming back.

Yeah, despite Russia's propaganda to the contrary, a good chunk of the world had a very strong suspicion regarding Russia's intentions by that point. And, given his connections with western society, it would require no special insight to surmise that his holdings would be the target of sanctions. The main item I would imagine Abramovich had inside knowledge regarding was the poor state of Russia's military due to rampant corruption and this the fact that they would fall on their face in the first three days instead of performing the swift decapitation Putin intended.
Those countries also have great social safety nets that we don't here. Huge difference when you're taxing everyone to actually do good vs taxing so that the rich can have an extra mansion.
Who do you think will end up owning all the houses, if buying one for yourself costs 30% extra in tax while buying more for your rental portfolio is tax free? (And then the renter is the one paying the tax on each rent payment.).

That's the thing. Rich people don't pay taxes anyway so in order to generate revenue to cover the losses from removing income taxes, they have to tax things poor people buy-- namely gas and food.

They try to dupe people who have trouble understanding that a lower income person or a person with little property will pay much more on a per Capita basis than a wealthy person without progressive taxes like income tax which they hate so much. Property taxes in particular end up being really problematic in lots of places since low income areas end up starved for funding for schools and infrastructure even after raising their mil rates as much as possible while wealthy areas can keep those rates at a minimum to fund top of the line services.

It's very common for property taxes on a percentage/mil rate basis to be super high in lower and middle income areas than in wealthier ones since the rich folks can easily fund services if they have huge houses or a diverse tax base. They'll try to argue though that somehow this is NOT a regressive tax because they pay more on a dollar for dollar basis (just like they might with a national sales tax scheme) although that is totally misleading.

Oh, no, they know exactly what they're doing: It's not actually a universal sales tax, but a selective 30% tax on "personal consumption"... Meaning zero tax tax on people with enough extra capital to insert themselves as middlemen, retailers, speculators, or landlords.
Yeah, and that’s too bad for the energy companies, but they have to take the L - their prediction models failed, so why are we paying for that? If they bought a shitload of gas at X price, and it’s now X -60%, then they should take that hit and absorb the cost through the massive profits they’ve been scooping up for years.
It may seem disingenuous to buy gas when it’s expensive, but if you don’t, then the level of panic about your low gas reserves pushes up the gas price, so you’ll pay even more tomorrow.

The reason that the gas prices are coming down now is precisely because our gas storage is relatively full right now. Hadn’t we filled it with expensive gas in the past months, then today’s gas prices wouldn’t be coming down.

What the price trends will look like will also depend on our gas consumption levels in the coming month or so. If consumption stays as low as it it today I’d expect consumer prices to fall rapidly. If consumption picks up and gas storage levels start declining, prices may stay higher for a bit longer.

Gas storages are currently actually filling up rather than depleting due to low gas consumption for the time of the year.

It’s likely that even a year from now, some % of the gas storage still expensive gas bought last autumn. The lower this % becomes, the lower prices will become.

Let's not pretend that they're trying to lower prices as quickly as possible or at all. If competition doesn't force them to drop prices back down they will simply keep them.

It'll take about 10 years for competition to pull prices back down. Despite being a few servers and a call centre, supply companies are really difficult to get running due to the regulation and loads of the smaller ones collapsed (even if for their number of customers they had by far the most already bought off the market so should've been far more buoyant but they couldn't reach the sheer scale of credit that they needed, even though they were already the most expensive for that reason and had the wealthiest customers who always pay).
God forbid developing nations learn from advanced countries on how to develop while being cleaner and not destroying the earth.

If you want to indulge the [far] leftist theoreticians, no country achieved communism. Even the former Soviet bloc countries only declared themselves socialist and on the path to communism, but not entirely having completed it. So it's hard to say what something that never existed might be like. Of course, the theoreticians who praised this ideal communism probably would not accept that it has to be authoritarian, despite the "dictatorship of the proletariat" as a critical transitional phase. As the joke/saying goes, temporary things have a way of becoming permanent.

Now regarding China nowadays, it's even further away from Soviet (or Maoist) style socialism, let alone ideal communism. Some have compared China to fascism or at least state capitalism, the justification for either being rather tricky on a pure Marxist basis.
The law on personal jurisdiction for corporations is not minimum contacts but state of incorporation or headquarters since Daimler in 2013. These plaintiff’s attorneys need to get their shit together - you aren’t changing recent SCOTUS PJ decisions. File in the right court and prosecute a meritorious case.
The analysis is not minimum contacts. Daimler in 2013 overruled International Shoe concerning corporate entities. You have to sue corporations where they are incorporated or their headquarters are. If you are a plaintiffs attorney with a meritorious case, why are you messing it up by ignoring clear Supreme Court precedent? As a trial lawyer, I think this is borderline malpractice.

This case is about venue, not the merits of the case. The plaintiff’s lawyers filed where their office was and not where the defendant they were suing was “located.” There’s a 100+ years of case law on where you should best sue corporate entities and you ignore that at your peril.

On the other hand as the article points out, corporations do that all of the time by requiring lawsuits to be filed in specific venues even when the consumer, corporate headquarters, and the harm occurred somewhere else.
That's understating it. The budget for Russia's air force is larger than that for the _entirety_ of the Ukranian military, as in all branches, combined. And they were supposed to have a 5:1 air advantage. There's a reason why people where completely flabbergasted at them being unable to achieve air superiority with that overmatch.
As mentioned before, the weapons really only came in weeks after the Feb invasion since everyone was expecting said air force and conventional mismatch to flatten everything and it'd be a guerilla resistance. Also the West has specifically _not_ been providing any jets, and mostly land stuff the air force should be able to blowup, since that's the point of an air force.

yes, neither side is capable of gaining air superiority, and so far air power has had pretty low impact to the war overall.

it obviously wouldn't hurt for ukraine to get more jets though, since it at least then they would have the possibility to out sustain russian air force, who will have difficulties to get new jets, or spare parts for maintanence.

To be specific, what they are referring to about russian jets needing visual confirmation is that so far in this war, russia has not used things like laser guided munitions or other ground-designated guidance systems/methods, at least not nearly as much as anyone would have expected them to. They also are not equipping their aircraft with targeting/sensor pods that allow for electronic aiming.
They haven't, they were just saying how two faced the Republicans are. IF a dem even looks the wrong way the Republicans would do everything they can to ensure they hang, but if Republican tries to commit a coup they just think he's a strong politician.
As they considder that a democrat president always has stolens the election there is no such thing as a non republican president and as such the president can do what he wants /s.

The loud people in this country think a REPUBLICAN President should do whatever he wants without any recourse for asking what was done or why. That’s the message....

Well it’s less that. He has pissed off republicans and their ability to gain elected seats. He is quickly becoming persona non grata and we see that with the Kanye Nick Fuentes stuff from last week.

As soon as he breaches an unknown breaking point, the ENTIRE traditional Republican Party will turn him out and discard him for losing his usefulness. Trump will still have support from the maga crowd, but fortunately they alone are only loud and wholly incapable of governing successfully.
"I don't need God to keep me from raping and murdering people. I rape and murder exactly as many people as I want to, and that number is zero.".
Yup. There is a huge hypocrisy standard all around. I recall when the Debra Lafave case happened way back along with the Mary Kay Letourneau case, and all I remember hearing from people like Bill Maher and so many others (mostly men) was that it what they did wasn't rape because the victims in the case must have obviously wanted it, due to them being pretty, I guess.

We don't. We just point out the hypocrisy of Republicans, who claim anything LGBTQIA+ people do as wicked and evil, yet won't say anything about actual abuse. The Qanon bullshit actually hurt victims of sex abuse and sex trafficking, and despite being shown the evidence of it, they refuse to stop with their bigoted hate. It's ridiculous.

I think they're already past that. They're at mass violence against LGBTQIA+ people. With the likes of Christopher Rufo, Matt Walsh, and Chaya Raichik, they want extermination and eliminationism.
For me the core difference between legalising weed and mushrooms.. pills, etc.. vs things like heroine and cocaine is how addictive they are. Do you go full ham and not limit people’s use of it if it’s legal? That’ll go wrong - look at the opioid problem big farma caused handing out much weaker opioids like candy. Do you restrict them to certain amounts per person? Same problem but now you’re just recruiting en masse for the illegal drug trade.
The problem with the US crisis was when they cut people off and left them to seek illegal means. I don't see how the stuff is any less addictive than alcohol and tobacco, but when we cut people off alcohol it was a crisis too.

The point if I'm not mistaken is to provide clean substances so that addicts won't risk buying product cut with fent. Comes from a place of empathy & saves lives, but looks really ass backwards. Not to mention- if these drugs are freely available while deemed illegal, cartels profit off of sales instead of US businesses & US government (from taxing sales). Sounds cray but you can cut the cartel off financially somewhat w this avenue.
This is the fallacy of thinking you can better figure out how to manage resources than the rest the world working together and making independent decisions on what resources are valuable, what prices should be paid for them and how they are allocated.
Suggesting anyone who recognizes these things is just a victim of lobbying or manipulation is quite ironic — because the exact same argument could easily be levelled at anyone who believes capitalism is inherently exploitative and things would be so much better under socialism.

The more you understand the capitalist system beyond the propaganda and indoctrination of the capitalists, the more you understand it is an abomination, just like slavery, feudalism, and apartheid.

I guarantee he would. He has never consequences for anything in his entire life. Why would he think he might face consequences for something as minor as perjury now?
This is an attempt to show regret for his actions to get a softer punishment. If the jury believes he regretted what he did and was sorry they MIGHT either leave the amount owed at what it is or lessen it.

'Woke' means, 'something DeSantis disagrees with'. It can stretch and morph to include anything DeSantis or other right wing politicians want to to demonise. Needless to say, its creeping fascism.

DeSantis is just a symptom of creeping fascism, this is something that has been decades in the making. It didn't start with Trump. It goes way way back.

I do appreciate this dive you did, and I feel that what Stanford said is after-the-fact damage control spin. If you're a US citizen, you're automatically American because that's the name of the country and thus an interchangeable term. If they were truly concerned about Canadian and Mexican representation when describing residents of the continent, then just say "North Americans" because that's the name of the continent. I read it originally as saying not to use American because it might hurt the feelings of people who are present without paperwork to be so, or have paperwork but aren't citizens. North American would also include the undocumented and H1-B visa holders. Visa holders aren't Americans or US citizens, even if they live there for years as they are expected to return. They are temporary residents as are tourists.
But I agree there’s a big shift and I believe it’s not because of the Russian attacks on civilians made the allies do this. Those have been going on from the beginning of the war and only now we see these big changes.
It’s either that or ukraine is severely running out of ammo for their Soviet equipment (or spare parts) and they need to quickly change to nato stuff that the Allies can help with support and ammo.

It would have been easier on Ukraine for just one NATO ally to dump half of its military equipment into Ukraine while the rest of the alliance backfills that one country from their own stocks.

Ukraine is going to have bits and pieces of every western military, which is not great logistically and in terms of training. OTOH Russia is going the other way, digging into the Soviet-era stuff in the back of the cabinet, consistent, but woefully outdated and poorly maintained, unable to keep up production of the new stuff. Personally, as an armchair general myself, I think I would take the random assortment of modern hardware over rusted out Soviet bits.
Joe Biden himself could literally walk up to these people who claim he's senile and say the following:
That stated, there's presently no reason to seriously doubt Joe Biden will be able to serve another four year term.

I mean, yeah, ideally he'd replace her as VP for his reelection, but people act like the nation would be completely rudderless if something happens to Biden. She's a bad candidate, but she's a pretty generic Democrat and would probably be a stable hand if that happened. The fear of Biden dying in office really isn't as big of an issue as people paint, unless the VP is truly abhorrent and unqualified (Palin, for example).

I don't know what to tell you. You guys seem to be pissed when people keep voting GOP, but then don't want to accept them into your coalition at the same time. What do you want, exactly? For us to not vote Democrat?
If you go to the Serbia subreddit you will see comments like “The Americans will be in Beograd in 2 days if they take a leisurely pace”, so no Serbians are well aware and nobody wants conflict.
As for your claim of Austria invading them to stop them expanding? Maybe read about how Serbia shocked the world when they agreed to all but one point in the Austrian ultimatum and then how Austria uses the war to ethnically cleans Serbians into mass graves.

Also it wasn’t just Serbs who opposed this behaviour (Serbs were scared, rightfully, that they are next to be annexed), it was most of the people in the region and the Balkans.

Serbs weren’t this empire that tried to steal territory all over the Balkans, we were torn between two ideas. One was consolidating a Serbian nation, which included territory that today belongs to Bosnia and Croatia because Serbs used to and to some extent still live there. The other was the pan-slavic idea that was uniting all southern slavs into a single state because we are all quite similar, and a lot of people in other areas of Yugoslavia supported that.

Since the end of the 1800s (and possibly longer), Serbian nationalists have had this idea of gathering all the slavic people into one great nation ruled from Belgrade.

Serbia and its nationalist leader did really not like the dissolution and a war raged for years with a lot of ugliness (as in most wars, but worse than many) including genocidal slaughter of Bosnians in Srebenica. Eventually the war ended, but Serbian nationalism did not end.

Suppose I'm tired of the pussyfooting we've done around Russia for so many years, and think they are all complicit in their crimes. The German deathcamp convictions come to mind, everyone was following orders and they weren't even doing the actual killing. But by helping the machine function, or even just by not trying to stop it, you are partly responsible for its output.
There were plenty of passive silent people in all horrible regimes, just wanting to live their normal life.

I completely agree the jokes are tiring, however I also think we can call all passive Russians complicit, even if standing up would result in their detention or death.

In other words, even taking at face value your assertion that it's only gallows humor "when you're the one on the gallows," we are all kind of on the gallows in some sense when people like Putin run the world. What can you do besides laugh at that? And why police people who want to derive a bit of black humor out of what's otherwise a depressing situation?
Democrats are baby-killing, anarchist, transgender grooming antifa scum. Listen to talk radio for the 4 minutes between advertising and you'll think progressives are Satan incarnate. But also, many many Republicans are single issue voters on guns and abortion.
I forgot to mention that there's a healthy portion of true nutter-butters. My churchy/religion-obsessed grandmother told me in 2008 that Obama was, in fact, the antichrist (I knew then that her brain was a marshmallow). My fox News loving coworker insisted recently that, "we'll never know" the results of the 2020 or future presidential elections. So don't forget that some people are just hopelessly stupid.

Imagine being such a vile, selfish sack of shit that you'd want to decimate the overall economy and cause others to suffer a miserable existence so you can be incrementally more rich. That's the very nature of a wealthy republican voter.

That in no way matches how Republicans rule. They increase spending and reward those who are already rich. They keep hard working folk in low paying jobs in favor of CEOs.
Everything? That's hardly the case. There's also evidence that suggest it's a KH-101. Let's just wait for an investigation instead of parroting conjecture we find on twitter.
Well today we have seen US officials claim it was a Russian missile, fired from Russia, then we saw them claim it wasn't fired by Russia but still a Russian missile, then we saw that maybe it was a missile fired from Belarus, then possibly an S300.

out of their ass, since the general consensus now is it was a Ukrainian 5V55 missile from a S-300 that went off course when trying to intercept a Russian missile and landed in Poland.

I \think\ we are talking about the possibility of Russian missiles fired by the Russian military stationed in Belarus hitting Poland. This doesn't necessarily change anything, but it does add an extra layer of complexity.

If you look at a map, Belarus stands out like a sore thumb as an obvious possibility. Poland says it was definitely Russian-made, and Russia has previously fired similar missiles dangerously close to Poland from staging areas in Belarus.

He (hopefully) means as in not fired directly from Russia itself, but more likely from missile batteries from within Ukraine or possibly Belarus. Notice i said "hopefully".....
Again the people that died from the terrorist blast didn't do any of this or had anything to do with this. You need to separate the government from the victims of this atrocity. Turkey has a lot of shit to answer for and they should but has nothing to do with this terrorist activity, just ask any Armenian.
That being said i would like to know how accurate the evidence is against whatever group the government is pinning this on. Could this be from the putin Chechen playbook? If it is really the PKK or just trying to drive support to eradicate the kurds. If this is really the PKK then f them.

No, this is wrong thinking terrorists attacks against civilians is terrible and the people responsible should be tried and punished as severally as possible. This is indiscriminate killings of people and an eye for an eye is barbaric and makes whatever political statement moot. I am sorry that innocent people died living their lives.

Killing of innocents is killing of innocents. It seems they're only terrorists when standing up to the wrong people though. Hence all the US civillian support for the IRA up until they had their own terror attack to deal with.
The guy literally paid a buddy of his 20k per legal immigrant to fly them from Texas, to Florida, up to Boston or whatever. Not a single Republican I know down here asked why it cost that much to fly random ass asylum seeker on what is like… a 300 dollar ticket normally.
Because it’s corruption. Blatant corruption that’s impressively worse than anything Rick Scott pulled, and that dude tried to mandate drug testing for welfare recipients coincidentally utilizing his wife’s lab company to do said drug testing.

Dawg, these “contracts” are all being awarded without bids to his political donors. Every Republican I know down here is quiet as fuck about the migrant shipping bullshit because of how bad it looks; ain’t no one can actually justify the fact that Ronny D paid a political contributor 20k a head to fly legal asylum seekers from Texas to Boston.

Why doesn't Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, Ted Cruz & other border state officials put those resources to good use to naturalized those immigrants seeking asylum, rather than pull a cheap political stunt?

We are all immigrants, unless someone is native American. If one were to look too hard through their genealogy, they may find that some of their own ancestors may not have arrived here quite legally.
But addiction can be avoided a lot easier than cancer. You can’t get addicted if you never use or ingest the substance in the first place. There are tons of people with strong genetic tendencies who never become addicted because they never use for the first time.
Yet apart from the supply-side “keep the pills off the streets” (which is clearly unsuccessful), no one seems to be talking about this at all. WHY are so many Americans picking up pills and heroin to begin with?? And how do we stop that from happening?

How do we prevent it? Treating cancer is important, but everyone agrees avoiding it in the first place is much better. But everything regarding these overdoses is about treatment and almost nothing about preventing addiction.

Israel is the most diverse country in the Middle East, a democracy, gave up some of their own land to Palestine in pursuit of peace and Hamas’ military is considered a terrorist organization for a reason.
Beyond that, Israel has offered peace and Palestinian control over the West Bank and Gaza but the Palestinian government refused over Israel only willing to grant a limited amount of Palestinians the right to return. Israel granting a full right to return would destroy the country and lead to more bloodshed. Because although only hundreds of thousand Palestinians were ethnically cleansed/left israel, the Palestinian governments demand was that their millions of decendents be able to return to israel. Anyone who thinks a full right to return is practical either wants more conflict and death or is living in the clouds.

I also ask why so much focus is on Israel and Palestine when there are other groups in similar situations. Western Armenia was successfully ethnically cleansed during the Armenian genocide. There's an Armenian diaspora all around the world. A holy site for the Armenian people is in another country. Currently Armenians are being killed in ethnic conflicts in lands that were historically theirs before another group came.

Jews in Israel are also dealing with groups that would see them pushed into the sea and many jews are still alive who witnessed arab attempts to wipe them out. It's remarkable they were ever willing to make concessions that would put their security at risk. Especially with all the genocidal and anti-semetic rhetoric that gets preached against them.
Why is it absurd? Inconvenient or unusual I get but, absurd? Presidency is a team job - as long as the person surrounds themselves with the right people and has the character/wisdom to listen to their advice, why does it matter? Presidents have always been limited in their knowledge and have always depended on an army of experts and staff, Biden has had great success so far and someone half his age might not have been able to duplicate that.
He has the charisma of a barrel, DeSantis on the national stage is going to be a tough sell. People are hoping it’ll be him because there’s just nobody else - him and Trump are the biggest names and Trump is a general election loser so Republicans are hoping against hope that DeSantis will step up.

RNC won’t do a thing. First off, there is a serious chasm between the RNC and the primary voters and second, to eliminate Trump the candidates would have to Voltron behind someone else and none of them are humble enough to do it. That’s how Trump eeked by the first time around, too.

It will be a mistake to put too much focus on Trump over the next couple years. Trump is a proven loser, he will never win another election unless there is a military coup to put him there. DeSantis is the only other proven commodity in the GOP. He’s staying in the background because a) he’s a coward and b) he knows he has to wait for Trump’s legal trouble / self-implosion to play out before he makes a real move or Trump’s base may turn against him. When everything shakes out it will be DeSantis as the nominee and yelling about Trump on the internet will have been a waste of time. Focus on the future.

The Church has two millennia of history providing education, medical services, and poverty alleviation. It has only been in the last century or so that state provided education services have overtaken religious ones. And that's without considering the efforts of religious figures pushing the state to do more.

The religious climate tends to act as a push factor rather than as a pull factor here. Elmore City was the inspiration of Footloose, and now Republicans seem dedicated to making the whole state be like Elmore City.

Fair point. However, I argue that everyone should know the eras of history, to understand different laws related to their job, as well as things that will benefit their metacognition (higher thinking). I personally think education should be free on all levels, free college as well. Everyone should be allowed the right to further themselves educationally. There are benefits to learning various subjects, such as learning music improves various parts of the brain. I don't devalue the trades at all. We definitely need trade schools. However, I personally think that there are benefits to learning across the board. I personally don't see education as something that should ever "stop".
Obligatory I'm not a republican and I'm allowed to criticize democrats and not be called names for it.
It's so obvious that he got that position because he stepped down and endorsed Biden in the primary, and he's been a politics-first, prepare for '24 transportation secretary from the second he was nominated.

He’s been doing a fantastic job with messaging lately, so I’m hoping he does or says something similar to this. That’s really all the Democratic Party has to do at this point for the next two years to win the media messaging game. Simply say, “This is what we have tried to do and the GOP said no,” and then they can just go highlight all the bullshit they’re doing instead of what they claimed they were going to do during the mid-terms.

I’m not talking about how all the GOP wants to do is be as obstructionist as possible and try to pin all of the problems that stem from that on the Democratic Party.
Minneapolis is on my list with Chicago, Denver, the Northeast, and the west coast for places to look at.
I've been making my GTFO of Texas plan and Minneapolis is on my list with Chicago, Denver, the Northeast, and the west coast for placea to look at. My only real concern is that I've heard people are generally pretty closed off insofar as they have their established friend grounds so it's hard to make friends as a transplant.

Realistically just some of the major cities in those areas, but it's easier to just say the Northeast or the West coast instead of specifically listing them. The biggest thing I learned from living in Texas is that I don't want to live anywhere Republicans have a good amount of power.

I lived there before I moved here and spend a few weeks back there every year. Chicago + Illinois have a lot of issues and I consider it less preferable than most of the other places I would consider moving to due to that, but Texas also has serious flaws and is trying to get worse so I don't have any good reason to stay.
Ukrainian defenders destroyed a bridge over the Molochna River near Melitopol'. It was on the supply route for Russian invasion forces in Zaporizhzhya region.
Russia has already strategically lost this war, Putin just can't admit it or he'd end up like Gadaffi.

Surely by now everyone can agree that Russia has strategically lost this war? How does Russia expect to compete with a western supplied Ukraine in the long term?

It’s okay for now because Ukraine can play for time in a way that Russia can’t. Which is why I think we see the current dynamic of Russia deploying its very best and very active all up and down the line. Thousands of losses over past week. Not sustainable long-term. They needed huge momentum for the cost they are paying. These incremental gain are not enough. Ukraine can keep this up, more aid will come, and the gap between the militaries will only grow.

If the West sends F-16s then they are essentially giving Ukraine a reach that extends that of the HIMARS. What other option is there? The aircraft can fly deep into enemy territory and launch its missiles there. Even if the West gives missiles with a range of 80km, the same rules don't apply as with the HIMARS. Aircraft are more flexible.
Why does it have to be someone’s fault immediately after people get shot(other than the shooter of course). Seems like politics has gotten to the point where blaming the other side supersedes compassion for the actual victims and their families. Everyone is using tragedy as a selling point to push their agenda. The victims lives appear to be meaningless outside of helping everyone show why their side is right. It’s a shame that this is what we’ve come to.
I believe that both are possible for sure, my only point was that it seems like nowadays there’s very little acknowledgement of the victims or their families(especially in the media/social media) when things like this happen. I am sorry for your loss.

Sincerely sorry to hear of your past trauma. That definitely sucks and would influence your personal opinion.

So, 7 House Republicans who voted in favor will be out of a job in 10 days anyway, and the other two will be out of a job in two years. It blows my mind that the GOP is totally OK with crippling government operation just so they can try to make Democrats look bad. Just wait until the vote on whether to raise the debt ceiling or not.
Please explain how you think failing to raise the debt ceiling will reign in spending. Also please outline what you think the consequences of such a move will be. In detail, please.

Honestly... Ok? We know their play book for Jan 6th and we don't have a president who will sit idle hoping they succeed this time at toppling the government. We may get to find out who will really win in a battle between 2nd amendment LARPers and the military...

As we know the parties realigned from the 50s into the late 60s, so one could say this is literally the same through line effort that abolitionist Republicans were afraid of now being represented by modem day conservatives.
Because they have successfully indoctrinated their base to believe that everything bad is someone else's fault, and the donors owners of the Republican party also happen to own the major media outlets; the very same outlets who consistently and all too frequently put the onus for every single fucking thing going on in American politics on the Democrats even -- and especially -- when it's the Republicans actually causing problems.
So Republicans can burn the house down, admit to it openly, and cheer on the flames... and yet somehow it's always the fault of the Democrats for not stopping Republican arson, or not being able to put out the fire quickly, or not cleaning up quickly enough. Republicans never admit fault, and even if they did their voters wouldn't give a shit, and the donors won't care because they're there to get their tax cuts and other handouts like PPP.

The only calamity McCarthy cares about is losing the Speakership, so he probably doesn't care one way or the other if the rest of us get screwed by GOP power games.
"October 10, 1952, Harry Truman said this: Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years.".
Here’s the thing. It was already an unconditional surrender except for one minor detail. Immunity for Hirohito, as I had already mentioned. Which he already got. History just doesn’t line up with this view that it was necessary. There is to show what I said.

Honestly, I think it’s pretty clear and I err on the side of MacArthur on this one. I do understand the fog of war and why Truman chose to do what he did. That is not without doubt. But I also do think someone with more foresight, which Truman sorely lacked, would have seen how unnecessary it was in the end.

Truman was a decent enough small man put into an office he wasn't prepared for and he didn't destroy the world. But also he exemplified the qualities of what the Commander in Chief should be: a civilian. There's good reason to have the military command under the power and subject to civilian authority.
I suppose destroying weapons might have merit but then the US Navy would not be a navy at all. Would save the US a lot of money if we just stopped spending money procuring weapons for the Navy.
Seizing goods on the high seas is piracy. It being approved by national or international law does not make the piracy not be piracy. Pirates taking cargo that is considered contraband is piracy of contraband.

If they stole the weapons from a ship that was carrying them legally and then sold them, then I could see piracy but not this.

They seized illegal weapons from ships that were illegally smuggling guns. Now, instead of destroying the weapons, they want to give them to Ukraine. Now, if they are just "donating" those weapons to be included in one of the next aid packages, how is that piracy?

I'm confused.. How is it piracy for them to seize illegal weapons from gun runners and donate them to Ukraine? Serious question as I know nothing about piracy?

How can this not be piracy? Obviously if the word holds negative connotation then we can invent positive words. Maybe "high seas capture of freedom prize"?
They know the shit they propose isn't going to pass, it's all optics like most Republican bullshit. I doubt after the abortion fiasco they actually want to pass anything but they will put forward all sorts of bills for propaganda purposes and blame Biden for not passing them. All they care about is obstructing government and blocking tax reform, it's what they were paid off to do.
Honestly, even if the GOP controlled all branches of government and both levels of congress I would want them to pay our bills. This is so stupid how politics has become a sport with moronic voters trying to rack up points for doing the opposite of what the other side wants.

And like last time they won't talk about that and all the little idiots who argue that all politicians are equal will proceed to pretend like the preening and posturing is equal and without consequences.

Well, the Americans got downgraded last time they did this, making the loans they depend on more expensive. Hurtig all programs and plans, especially infrastructure, health, education.
I mean even in NYC, Republicans at the state level fuck things up. NYC has wanted to drastically expand its school zone speed camera program for years, but Republicans in Albany put a stop to it every time.
Conservatives don't even acknowledge that they're homophobic. My dad used to say things like "look at that queer, I wish I had an excuse to punch him" to my brother and I as kids if we passed someone who "looked gay" in the street. Despite this, he will to this day deny that he is or ever was a bigot. "Live and let live, that's my motto," he'll say, adding: "just as long as they don't ram it down our throats." When you ask him to clarify what "ramming it down our throats" means, he'll say "you know, holding hands and kissing in public, that sort of thing.".

Woah. Dehumanizing people and telling your followers that they’re ruining your country leads to unfavorable actions against those people? Honestly I’m amazed. I never thought words could lead to violence. It’s never happened before. Not in WWI, or WWII, or the civil rights movement, or truly any event in history.
I’m thinking that the world may have been slightly less unified against Russia when the invasion started if Biden hadn’t been so up front about what was happening.
Biden was saying for weeks before the invasion that Russia was going to invade, but Zelensky didn't believe it and it was he who dropped the ball in preparations. Even so, Zelensky still managed to protect Kyiv, destroyed Russia's elite troops and push them out of the area while he stood his ground, but the lack of preparation in the South is why Kherson and Mariupol was lost.

Why though? Financial support is just as critical as the military aid if we expect them to actually win the war, which at the rate they are going should happen in another year. I mean weapons are good, but you also have to pay your soldiers, which is sort of hard when 20% of your country is being occupied and your ports blockaded.

Also you can't supply an army in a week or two even if congress gave Biden the go-ahead to do so because of the logistics involved. As it is, Ukraine did pretty well with the minimal support we gave them over eight years given that they were total pushovers when Russia annexed Crimea.

Don't get me wrong, Russia shouldn't have invaded Ukraine, and they deserve condemnation, but the involvement now is getting a little bit silly.
You should take some time to learn about the rise of the nazi party in Germany. The republicans are on the exact same track. It’s not watered down at all.
Is it watered down though? Some of the traits of fascism are religious fanaticism and rampant sexism which is exactly what this dress code is based on. I wouldn't say the terminology has been watered down, I'd say the racists and fascists have just gotten bolder.

We literally had segregation just a few decades ago and it was never referred to as fascist. I would say that was far more fascist than not wanting trans woman in women's safe spaces. Bigoted, sure. Statistically unlikely to have an issues? Absolutely. Fascist though?

Seriously? He was the first person to think transwomen in women safe spaces could be a threat to women? That seems unlikely, but I have no idea. My wife doesn't even ride in ubers anymore because of the harassment and threats she has gotten from men. I can sympathize with the fear some women may have with the idea of places that they actually feel safe having a change like this might be threatening. Maybe he was vocal about it? But I highly doubt he started it. It seems like a very rational fear, given what women have been through and have to put up with. It isn't fair to transwomen, and I think society will eventually be accepting of the idea, but I don't think every woman who is worried right now is a fascist or nazi lol.

You guys would have hated the 90s. Skirts, hose, and heels were mandatory at tons of jobs. I don't think these old farts are quite the monsters you think, just too old fashioned for modern job market and culture.

That is wild. I had never heard that before. Wait, groomers came from Hitler too? Now I just don't believe you. I can't imagine disapproval of adults grooming kids started with Hitler. I'll look into it a little later, of course.
What precisely did you think we (if you mean the US) has ever done that hasn’t designed to be inherently it its own interests? (I use the word designed loosely here. It turns out that continually arming and training groups that you know nothing about without even a toddler’s understanding of history or culture or languages or politics turns out to NOT be in your own interest. Pretty much all the time. Oopsie).

Until the democratically elected prime minister didnt work for the agenda of the west by nationalizing the country oil, so the US and UK overthrew him in the 1953 Iranian coup.

Putin is a fool. I originally thought he was smart, now I know he is just ruthless. Saying you are going to fire a nuke is only a threat. Kind of like a criminal holding a gun to someone’s head. While the gun man can kill the hostage, he will be the next to die….so, unless he has a death wish, he can’t kill the hostage.
For less than 2% of one years worth of the US military budget, the west has aided Ukraine in fight the Russian military to a stand still. Imagine if Putin fires a nuke and US and NATO open a can of whoop ass, how many hours until Russia’s nuclear capability is degraded to zero.

Russia will not risk using nuclear weapons to defeat Ukraine because if they did they know the result is the retaliation against Russia will be the total and absolute annihilation of Russia.

Putin have threatened nuke to just about anyone he is pissed at but he knows the sole purpose of NATO is to eradicate Russia if it attack any NATO members so it is reasonably safe bet (hopefully) it is his usual bluff.

Putins saber rattling with his nukes is repetitive, but it isn’t a threat we can just dismiss, especially when you remember his probable declining health and mental state, there might come a time when he really does try to take the world out with him.

While it’s fun to joke about Russia being incompetent, we really shouldn’t be assuming that their nuclear stockpile is nonfunctional. Even if only a fraction of them are functional, that’s still more than enough to devastate the rest of the world. Even if they’re degraded and lower power (from lack of upkeep of tritium or neutron sources for yield boosting or other issues) that’s still more than enough to devastate any city they attack.
They're dirt cheap to mass produce and deploy. Yet they cost a fortune to find and "safely" recover. I say "safely" as even the real pros will still get injured or killed in cleaning up minefields. It takes a long, long time to find and recover mines compared to the ease in which they are mass manufactured and deployed.
I've also read that in some countries some of the civilians recover mines for the valuable scrap. Yet again, it's more often children who are affected the most when doing so.

On top of that, a lot of Russian people actually believe all the Kremlin propaganda. That's a double edged sword. On the one hand it helps Putin retain power and explain what's happening. But on the other hand, it prevents Putin, or anyone else, from withdrawing from the war.

The US doesn't want full scale attack on Russia proper. To stretch that out to them not wanting Ukraine to take Azov or Crimea , when the US has stated full support for the liberation of those areas, is certainly a hot take.

With you on that. It would be better for everyone, including Russians, to be ruled under smaller and democratic states. Wouldn't solve all of earth's problems but it's a good start.
You're pointing to an interesting (and quite possible) development: Both sides being unable to achieve notable offensive results but for different reasons. The Russians because they don't have the ability to fight a mobile, offensive war for a variety of reasons and Ukraine because they'll have trouble breaking through very heavy layered defenses as you describe.
Once Ukrainians deploy all new tanks and long range missiles, they will make good progress and it seems that they will aim for Crimea first, since for Russians it’s harder to supply Crimea with weapons and ammunition, especially when the bridge is down.

If the push fails they will pretty much be sitting ducks once Ukraine is able to utilize the tanks it received, which is what this general is alluding to.

The reports are conflicting because Russia just launched their much hyped mass mobilization push, but they haven’t achieved any breakthroughs.

It seems like Russia's current offensive is their last attempt at a big offensive... and its already failing. Russia won't be able to gather enough forces for other big offensives in the future. So if their current attack fails, its really just WW1 trench warfare for them until the end.

Their current actions must also be viewed within the context of current South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol having publicly stated that he wishes for the US to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, in addition to expressing a desire for South Korea to develop its own indigenous nuclear arsenal.
While it is true that North Korea is prone to acting out pettily, it has not exactly helped that America has derailed many the genuine attempts of rapprochement between the North and South. South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was livid with the Bush administration after the "axis of evil" speech which ruined years of diplomatic progress and for cancelling a summit in North Korea which President Clinton had in the works.

To add to this: The mountainous terrain in North Korea is terribly ill-suited for farming and it is simply impossible for them to be self-sufficient in terms of food production with the size of their population. North Korea are already farming on most of their arable terrain, and their crop yields are not far off the international average, meaning that they have very limited potential for increasing their food production.

North Korea is trying to feed a modern-sized population (25,000,000) using medieval farming practices in a mostly hilly/mountainous country the size of Mississippi. Some years this actually works fine, on other years like the last three or so, famine will catch up to you just like in the medieval period. Because their fertilizer and industrial logistics are so fucked up, many remote villages rely on using human waste fertilizer, which is fine if safely and thoroughly composted, but they do not have time or space to do it. Instead, they directly apply it to the fields which increases the load of intestinal parasites in your body, greatly diminishing the calories you get in hard times.
Hospice isn't in-home care. It's always been intended to be an additional layer of support and information for patients and families while they continue whatever caregiving they would have without hospice.
Ah, so this is a hospice/home health combo company or something? It's not quite fair to disparage hospice in general for things not covered as part of hospice care. This particular company offers additional paid "add-ons" that don't meet your specifications, but that's not really part of what "hospice" is.

People can also revoke hospice and leave at any time, so if there is something available they want to pursue, it's just one signature on a form and you're back on whatever insurance plan you had before and you can go for it.

At first it was just a few "tea party" weirdos, but since Trump and the storm on the Capitol there seems to be a lot of fascist tendencies in the republican party.
The "dispute" over Gibraltar is nationalistic nonsense, it's pulled out whenever populists need to grandstand, but it's not a serious political issue. Gibraltar is British and will remain so for as long as Britain exists, and Spain is fully aware of that.
As long as Spain has something to gain from having the UK in the EU, which it does, then British sovereignty over Gibraltar won't even be part of the conversation outside of the media.

... Because the reclamation of Gibraltar has always been a big part of UK-Spain relations, Spain giving up their 1 chance to have Britain by the balls and actually have the leverage to maybe get Gibraltar back isn't going to happen.

And the UK could rejoin (if everyone agreed and they gave up all the special statuses they had before) they don't mean they could just rejoin without the consent of members xd.

You seem like you literally know nothing about European relations and are just saying "but anything could happen!".

It's more than that. It's a tax haven where many British businesses are registered. Many of those businesses have undue influence on our government. The EU is making efforts to close tax loopholes; in order for the UK to rejoin, Gibraltar would need to start complying.

As a Brit I'm fine with both of those. British exceptionalism needs putting in its place and we will all be the better for it. I want to be part of a union where everyone is treated equally.
You’d be amazed at how many people really have no idea of what’s going on. I think you could find an impartial jury but I’m not sure you could find a competent jury.
As someone who recently sat through jury selection for the first time in my life, I’ve got to say I’m concerned about the chances of any competent jury for any crime.

Voir Dire is the process by which attorneys select, or perhaps more appropriately reject, certain jurors to hear a case." It also refers to the process by which expert witnesses are questioned about their backgrounds and qualifications before being allowed to present their opinion testimony in court.

I'm not sure about that not legally bar Trump from running for President again, if he were convicted of Insurrection, wouldn't the 14th Amendement apply to him?

Would the next president pardon him, assuming the trial was over by 1/2025? I guess the trial being over doesn't matter, you can be pardoned for crimes that you have yet to be charged for. Still not sure about the next president pardoning Trump, even if it is a Republican.

Other articles I've read indicate that this is what would have to happen for an indictment to be charged, but a lot of people on reddit have disagreed, saying Smith has independent authority etc.. I believe the articles like this one more than my fellow redditors, especially when it comes to indicting a former president.
We already know how far a small cheap combustion engine drone with a bomb attached to it can travel, from watching what's been happening in the Ukraine.
What happens if China or Russia sends a dormant military drone across the ocean under a balloon, then detaches the balloon and flies the drone around independently, using their own military satellite communication systems?

Since it sounds like the first balloon widely reported may have been big enough to carry an actual bus, multiple drones could travel attached to a single large balloon and gradually separate from it in stages.

A balloon that you can program in the coordinates and fly exactly to your desired destination is impressive technology. Usually balloons just fly to wherever the currents send them.

A law voted in 2020 is taking survivor benefits from the children of servicemembers killed in action. The families losing the benefits found out only a month ago that the December 2022 payment will be the last one.
They used to, but as of January 2023, only surviving spouses will get survivor benefits, even if the children have been receiving benefits for years. The only way children can get the benefit is if there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse becomes ineligible (remarries before age 55).

I see how this is a difficult law to craft because there could be times where someone remarried and died 20 years later, in which case it may be the current wife and kids who need the benefits. I'm not defending the policy, or anything, just pointing out a possible legislative difficulty on this issue.

This is unfortunate. The reason is that the father who was a service member remarried right before his death, so his kids mother was no longer the surviving spouse.

It was military spouses who fought for this, because they didn't want some of their money going to the deceased veteran's children from a prior marriage. Hopefully it will be changed back, or some compromise can be reached.
Looks like it’s the animal welfare activists saying not to. Which makes sense. People who panic buy a chicken likely don’t know how to take care of them. Plus if the only reason you buy one is because of the shortage, when the shortage is over people might abandon the chicken. And if you’re buying a chicken your probably getting it as a chick. By the time it starts producing eggs the shortage might be over.
And chickens take time to grow and start producing eggs. I suppose they could buy an adult, but still, panic buying any animal is never a good idea.

I'll admit, I am waiting to see how many people panic-buy a chicken, only to find out later they got a rooster.

And then once people who panic bought a chicken don't need it, or they realize what they got into, they'll just let it go in the neighborhood.

I think this is addressed more at people who don't know anything about chickens and have no idea how to care for one. I don't know what restrictions New Zealand has regarding livestock, but they're likely anticipating people living in apartments going out and buying a chicken.
Russia has already lost, Putin is just murdering his own people at this point. Ukraine will not give in. More and more advanced weapons will keep flowing in.
They should get all the weapons they need. Ukraine never asked for this war. But the brave courageous people of Ukraine have stood up to Dictator Putin so please give them what they need.

Giving all that money for Ukraine Is good for the fight against Russian Imperialism. Something that could help america's allies and america Itaelf In the future. For you populists anything that inolves us aid is evil. You are out of touch with the modern world. Ukraine's far right parties got only 2.5% of the vote, Ukraine Is one of the least antisemitic countries in Europe, most of Azov is dead and they needed them out of desperation and most of Azov weren't nazis anyway. Blah blah blah. We pro Ukrainians have to say stuff like this over and over again because you anti Ukrainians keep forgetting It.

Are you implying Ukraine, A country at war since 2014, has been doing too little? Do I have to remind you that it rebuilt it's army from the ground up in just 8 years? Or do you need a reminder how the west continued expanding cooperation with Russia (NS2).

The EC president is elected by the EP, but the Council nominates candidates to be voted on. This nomination could be seen as merely ceremonial, or a formality as a safety mechanism of last resort so the Council could step in to prevent a potential despot from getting elected. In this interpretation, it's analogous to how the PM is nominated by the monarch in the UK, how the German president nominates a candidate for chancellor for the Bundestag to vote on, or along the lines of how its technically the Electoral College that elects the president in the US.
The fundamental question is one about how power in the EU is balanced, between member states' governments on the one hand, and the elected parliament, as well as the EC, on the other -- the EC becomes a politically more powerful institution if its president is chosen, not just confirmed, by a representative parliament.

You can think of the Commission (EC) as the cabinet, and its president as the prime minister. The Council represents the member states, seating its heads of government/state. Very roughly, its the upper house, the senate to the EU parliament (EP), which is the lower house.).

I have one of those. One of my best friends became a qanoner during lockdown. Now whenever I visit him I have to put up with him spouting off about gender issues, LGBT people, vaccines, the Clintons and how great Putin is. It's very tiring.
Then why the flying fuck is that guy not dethroned. Oh, make no mistake, we may live in a different time in history, yet if that fucker is never unseated, & he passes his power onto family, then he is a modern day monarchy.
I hope that’s true. How do you begin to imagine your country is well when you are willing to kill your own people? No regard for human life; not even their own kin.

Yup, it's what always happens with these leaders that blame the west. They need a scapegoat for all of their problems.
I mean the chinese economy is not at all like the russian one in which you can cut loose and expect zero blowback. Its in neither the west or chinas interest to engage in a trade war, especially right now.
Their supporting them with morphine and clothes, massive difference between that and tanks, drones, and laser guided weaponry. If china really wanted to see Russia win or make progress, they definitely could be doing a lot more, and unlike Iran or North Korea, some of the weapons they have could potentially make a serious difference against Ukraine.

What's crazy to me is how governmental institutions spent a decade building a narrative to justify war with Russia. The 2016 Russian election interference narrative was almost completely false. Then the years spent rehabbing Ukraine's image certainly makes it seem that there were factions who were waiting for the moment to engage in war with Russia.

Not to mention the effects of methamphetamine and dextroamphetamine are indistinguishable in therapeutic doses. They're the same drug by any meaningful measure.
Anyway the point is drugs are inflation proof (at least at scale). And most nothing else is. For ex. a Big Mac cost $2.36 in in 1996, it’s now $5.93.

It didn’t though… Cocaine has stable inflation proof pricing. The cost of a gram has not increased since 1996. True story. The economics of narco pricing is actually fairly interesting stuff, and all relatively stable. A gram of coke was $60 in the mid 90s in most of the US. It is still the same price. Marijuana $40 an eighth in 1998 (about the same today dependent on quality and state- but almost no inflation). Heroin same story a $10 bag still has 3 shots in it 25 yrs later (though it may be fentanyl instead now).

Typically, a $10 bag of “heroin” is meant to be one “dose” but people with a tolerance are usually doing multiples at a time. I was doing 5-6 in a single shot at one point and that’s nowhere near what some people do.

Are you saying a $10 bag of heroin has three doses in it? If so, that’s inaccurate. It’s also very much based on that persons tolerance, so what’s does a dose really even mean, ya know?

While I find your point interesting, we have to consider quality/purity too. Cannabis? Quality has increased dramatically. Cocaine? Probably far more cut then when it first made its rounds decades ago.

I just meant that (at least as I understand it) there's some debate over the particulars of just how much different stages of gender transition affect athletic ability - even among people who nevertheless agree that those particulars shouldn't affect whether or not transgender kids are allowed to play sports.

Trans girls (since trans men don't exist to conservatives and TERFs) have existed and played in women's sports for years now with no issue and college and Olympic sports have allowed it even at that level based on findings from medical professionals.

Can I just note that all the trans sports bans always seem to be focused solely on "protecting our girls against competition from biological males", but never the other way, something like "keeping trans busy out of our locker rooms" or something? Edit, got downvoted so let me add that it really says it all, about the control these GOP jackasses need, the control of gender norms and such that is betrayed by their own focus and language under the guise of 'protection.".

It really is. The Republican Party is trying to force LGBTQIA+ people into the closet and later the grave. They don't care about the kids; they never have. Well, at least the kids who aren't white Christian nationalists, at least.
"Streisand filed a lawsuit against photographer Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia.com for violation of privacy after his aerial photograph of her mansion featured in the publicly available archive of 12,000 California coastline photographs. Before the $50 million lawsuit was registered, “Image 3850” had been downloaded from his website only six times, two of which were done by Streisand’s lawyers. However, if Adelman had merely jumped the fence, public knowledge of the case obliterated it altogether. The following month, more than 420,000 people visited the archive and downloaded the picture.".
True. Indians have to come out of the victimhood mindset. Look at Vietnam. Buggers were colonised by the French and then attacked by the US. I don't see them complaining a lot.

Haven't watched the documentary myself. The documentary is about the Godhra riots in the Indian state of Gujarat. The chief minister of Gujarat at that time was Narendra Modi, the current PM of India. He had been widely criticised for his role during the riots. Though many cases were filed against him, the judiciary system has largely maintained that he is not responsible for it. Now the BBC has taken a more critical take on it and Mr. Modi is worried and has sought to ban the documentary.

Not only just the fact that they are a neighboring Slavic peoples, but especially on the Western side of Russia, a lot of Russian people have family over there, too.
Yes, there was native support for Russian imperialism in Ukraine but this conflict has always been, undeniably, about how Russians see Ukraine and has had far less to do with how Ukrainians see themselves. If the Russians cared one iota about the will of the people they wouldn’t be currently occupying large portions of Ukrainian territory that have never had native separatist movements. Almost no one in Melitopol was clamoring to join Russia, but Russia needs it as a bridge to Crimea (the center of their conception of themselves as the third Rome). Russia wants Ukraine’s lands, they couldn’t give two shits what their people want. Putin cares about the citizens of Donetsk as much as he cares about the citizens of Kyiv. They’re both just lives that have to be sacrificed so he can maintain a hold of Crimea and his perception of himself as a modern day Tsar. That’s all this war has ever been about for him and Pro- War Russians as a whole.

Thing is, there's plenty of Russians that would answer the same. You don't have to sacrifice yourself and go to prison, you just need to be a decent person to understand what's right and what's wrong. And it doesn't make you a good Russian, it's just make you a compassionate human being. None of us is free of responsibility, besides kids who were to young in the times of Putin's raise to power. I was, and I still know that I have my share of responsibility.

To be clear and honest, I'm half Russian and half Tatar person and I am strongly against the war. I'm not interested in being considered good. But I want to understand your logic.

1. Yes, it was a war. 2. As a Tatar I believe that Crimea belongs to Tatars, but it's situated in Ukrainian borders. 3. Of course it's a full scale war. 4. Of course Russia is an aggressor.

A lot of Russians support the war. Even the ones who don’t are not in the “same predicament” as Ukrainians who live their daily lives in-between air raids, missile attacks and often without electricity because of Russian actions.
The non aligned movement is dead with the USSR. India is aligned with the US against China. Russia is largely politically and economically irrelevant, the Indian military is just dependent on their defense industries.
Sure, the ideology of the NAM might still be influencing decisions. But the actual purposes and reasons for that ideology have been dead for decades. There is no negotiating power India has, there is no geopolitical negative impact to picking sides anymore - there is simply a country too tied into the Russian military-industrial complex to condemn an illegal invasion.

The real reason is India is dependent on Russia arms and maintenance but this dependency is slowly reducing as India is making its own indigenous and collaborating with countries like France. India hasn't sent anything to Russia but has sent aid to Ukraine.

Yeah I know but Russia is still necessary for Indian defence forces. Joint military exercises don't mean much India has done military exercises with China as well.

When India and USA did military exercises near Chinese borders in India. China objected and followed by an attempted capture of an Indian hill. Also China doesn't like QUAD alliance getting stronger.

Here in Sweden basically all the electricity companies are paying for solar energy you don't use. Since, well, it's your property & excess power. There's even stuff like stipends to have part of the cost paid.
Sounds very strange & exploitative that you'd need to pay for the panels AND the electricity they produce.

Solar panels are not the answer. You need a lot of them. It's only sunny during the day when you are at work. You can't heat your house during winter from solar panels when it's dark from 4pm to 9am. Places that get a lot of solar energy probably don't burn gas to stay warm in winter.

Gas gets burnt during winter to heat homes. Lots of solar radiation in summer does not offset this. You still have to burn gas in winter for heat.
I mean, it's more a poem or proverb than it is a series of independent sentences. Which means the meter, rhythm, is also important. Adding the extra word disrupts the 'flow' of the proverb, right at the end.
Each line has 9 words, adding the extra word only adds clarity if you don't take the work as a whole, and the only sentences someone is likely to use independently are the first and last sentences, referencing the whole.

I do agree. To dissolve a government that has thousands of nucelar weapons would lead to absolute chaos. Russia doesnt need to be destroyed, it needs a whole new government free of the KGB era.

It's been done before, which is why the Soviet Union doesn't exist any more. I think it's just a matter of finishing the job that was started with the USSR, and if Ukraine proves it can defend itself and win against Russia even after giving away its nukes it will make the argument more persuasive to get the remains of the Russian Federation to make similar agreements towards moving away from nuclear armageddon.

I do not in any way believe that Putin can be persuaded in rational dialogue, not at all - what I’m saying is that ignoring the fact that mutually assured nuclear destruction still holds (because it is unpleasant and deeply offensive to any sense of justice that Russia cannot be stopped by force without risking the end of mankind) is the fastest way to a swift death for the lucky ones among us and unspeakable suffering before a drawn-out painful death for the rest, and thus not a course that any rational person could possibly argue for.

Whether everything that happens is Putin’s fault or not - saying “oh well, we might all die, but it’ll be Putin’s fault so that’s okay then” is a similar statement that no rational person would agree with, and comments like this should make it very clear to any rational observer of the conversations on here that a certain part of the comments on this forum are being made in bad faith and not in the true interest of a rational dialog.

How do 21 active B-2 and a small fleet of B-21 bombers that won’t be active until 2027 in any way entirely negate an arsenal of thousands of nuclear weapons spread across Russia’s nuclear triad in hundreds of locations including submarines, bombers spread over different airfields thousands of miles apart, mobile launchers spread over a whole continent, etc.? The whole point of mutually assured destruction (which is in force today just as it has been for over half a century) is that even if Russia’s conventional military strenh is tiny compared to that of NATO, there is no way that Russia could be destroyed or overpowered that would not spell pretty much the immediate end of mankind, that part had not changed, and that is precisely why Putin embarked on this war in the first place - he knows there is no way he could lose completely that would not mean the end of the world, and he is betting on this very fact.

Suggesting that it is in any way possible to take out Russia’s nuclear capabilities without an overwhelming risk of global nuclear annihilation is at best incredibly ill-informed and naive, and at worst a downright malicious lie in the attempt to derail the conversation. It is not possible without a huge and entirely irrational risk, if it were it already had been tried and/or achieved, and the complexity of the current geopolitical situation is due to a very large extent precisely the fact that it is not possible.
I don't know about the Belarussians that go to your church, but in my old job the CEO and the entire development team are Belarussian and they hate Lukashenko with a passion as a corrupt dictator. Many of our devs including the CTO were arrested and beaten during the protests of the previous election. Some of our guys fled to Ukraine to escape being shot, just in time for the invasion.
To them, Luka is Putin's lapdog who is skating on thin ice. The moment Luka pisses off the populace by sending Belarussian troops, his ass is grass and he'll be taken down. He's a dictator trying to survive, just like Putin. It's just that Putin has fewer teeth right now than his own citizens.

Just as Trump is just now finding out, no one likes a loser, Putin. But to be fair, if Western powers really did see Kyiv fall in 3 days when the invasion started, there wouldn't be so much global support for Ukraine.

When something happens they won’t do anything, but if (very much hypothetically) Russia were to be attacked they’d be screaming from the rooftops how other CSTO countries aren’t helping them.

Honestly one has to wonder what the hell was the purpose of invading Ukraine if it meant that Russia's role as a peacekeeper among CSTO was severely compromised as a result?

It gives the sense that this botched and insane invasion of Ukraine came from the utter delusions of a madman who knows he's getting old and rather than dying with Russia in a somewhat good position on the global stage he decided that he needs some bizarre, batshit insane conquest to add to his legacy as the president of Russia.
Mass imprisonment and executions have been used by Russia, China, N Korea, and other nations to effectively control their country. It looks like they're banking of the making an example approach. 15K is relatively small when it comes to government mass executions, but announcing the executions vs disappearing people is relatively uncommon. If this were China, they'd publically execute 3 people and quietly execute 100K over this protest all the while claiming they champion human rights, but I guess Iran has a different culture.
Iran has issued death sentences to a handful protestors in the past according to Human Rights Watch, however, it’s unclear if they were ever carried out.

The concern that the increases funding for the IRS will not be used to target the rich is fair, especially considering the IRS’s history of going after lower hanging fruit. However it’s painfully obvious the republicans don’t actually care about that.
You are literally commenting on a post devoted to an article showing that it is true. The 60s and 70s were 50-60 years ago, what the IRS once did is not what it currently does.

Yeah, all the nonsense about the IRS "going after" low income people is so stupid. Low income people make money in a way that their reporting is easily verifiable by a computer. They're also most likely to mess up and claim child tax credits incorrectly, etc - all of which is verifiable and issued a letter by a computer.

Exactly. It's when someone misreports a number from their W2, didn't report 1099s they received, both separated parents claim a tax credit for the same kid, etc. All stuff that's easily checked by a computer. The IRS isn't "auditing" random low to middle income people. That would be a complete waste of their time.

Rich people report all of the simple stuff correctly because someone is doing it for them. Then put pressure on the CPA to be as aggressive as possible in other areas where they're have to actually be pulled for audit or it will never be seen.
MTG seems to be implying that the money should not go to Ukraine but should be given to struggling American families. What’s crazy is that republicans would never allow the money to be given to American citizens because these same people would scream socialism.
Republicans only approve two forms of Socialism: Free Money for Them and Free Money (in the form of Corporate Bailouts and Subsidies) for the Rich (their donors).

Correct, I'm involved in a project with backers who will readily accept credits for their benefit, profit from the program, and then turnaround and demand lower taxes for the wealthy. "Conservatism" is nothing more than a dressed up ideology for selfish motherfuckers.

That’s because you don’t know any real republicans, much less talk regularly to them, asshole. You drove the sane ones out of the party years ago, which is why your dad is 0-for in elections the past six years. The only “republicans” you hang with are the Lin Woods and Madge Greens and Roger Stones and Steve Bannons, outright nazis who took over the party.
There is a rage that builds inside me every time something like this happens. Every fucking time, all you see and hear is an innocent person pleading for their life and some piece of shit cops acting like it's just another day at the office. I have no place to put the rage I feel right now. I'm going to sleep. I hope those cops get what they deserve.
Thats why people insist that all cops are bastards. because the ones that did the killing and the ones that didn't do anything to stop it.

To be completely honest i don't think the entire pakistan was in on supporting the Taliban. Most probably one of the army or ISI factions helped the Taliban and now that the US is gone, those generals are using taliban to attack pro west parts of the army in an effort to seize power.
The ISI since 2021 supported the taliban's re-occupation of afghanistan, and stopped the GHQ's attempts at a ground invasion against the TTP. In Nov 2021 the GHQ overthrew the ISI, and in April 2022 overthrew the isi's allies in the civilian government in a soft-coup, and now the GHQ has a free hand in doing what it wants, which is tackling the TTP in afghanistan's provinces adjacent to pakistan.

it's actually a difference in opinion among the elites. the ISI has ideological or even islamic links with the Haqqani Network dating to the Soviet War. The GHQ or the central pakistan army doesn't see the taliban favourably but merely as an asset. They would support the ISI in their afghanistan policy, if it was in their interests. But the GHQ would also attack the taliban if it was in their security interests.

Every Military dictatorship in Pakistan has been extremely beneficial for its economy. You are right that shifting to a civilian government is a problem, because civilian governments always mismanage the economy due to factionalism and sometimes nationalization in the case of Bhutto.

Only 2006+India's GDP recently started outpacing Pakistan. 2006 was the time the TTP was born, the War on Terror was in full swing.

Sergey Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, has/had been doing a good job at keeping his name clear of association with the War, along with keeping the war out of Moscow (i.e. keeping the city clear of anything that might indicate there was a war going on). Other than that, the guy is most known for his fondness of building projects.

Of course Putin controls who gets to run for what and he wouldn't let Moscow be ran by someone he doesn't trust implicitly and Putin benefits from his capital being kept calm and the best way to do this is let them think there isnt a war going on.
Military style weapons have been banned in Canada for decades. "Assault style" is a meaningless label.

Is it true that pretty much any skilled gun enthusiast could take lower-velocity rifle rounds, and add extra bulk propellant to the cartridge to get the same result? Yes. It would be difficult to regulate, but no more so than any of the other stupid rules they've tried to enforce.

Trying to regulate something you dont understand is impossible to do well. Look at the US congress trying to grill tech CEO's and making such giant gaffs that their misunderstanding and ignorance is clear to everyone watching. When someone says we need to ban climate change, they sound ignorant and probably dont have anything meaningful to contribute to reducing greenhouse gases and its the same with guns. If you own guns, treat them with respect and care and always follow the rules, its pretty galling to listen to people mischaracterize them, mischaracterize you and the people you know and love and make broad, generalizing statements out of ignorance.
Us doing it is different, though. All it does is in our case is enable the opposition to have opportunities to sway more people in their direction, because they can use facts to control a narrative in ways you wouldn't want or expect.
And the idea that they "like candidates that violently try to overturn peaceful election" is based on one incident with one man during a period when, yes, the MAGA crowd was completely batshit. Not a majority, but large enough to do damage.

Democrats being more intelligent through leveraging buffoon republicans (by giving republicans more rope to hang themselves with) in order to smokescreen their own areas of corruption doesn't make them innocent.

I find it so aggravating that Republicans largely want to get elected simply so they can disrupt the government from functioning and helping the people just to make Democrats look bad so hopefully voters put them back in power later.
I tried to find some points to put the power plant firing in context - I figure if I have a question about the news then others might too. I typed up a couple paragraphs but ended up not posting most of it. The Wall Street Journal has done a few good English-language reports on what's going on there, but it's still hard to keep even a few basic things straight, such as "who's the lead Ukrainian worker in charge at the actual site of the plant?" or "how many IAEA inspectors are present?".
Yep. Stopping the war now and getting back to Russia with what is left of his army would be the most he can expect to gain.

Also, does her candidacy make liberals’ heads explode? I don’t think it does. I’ll never vote for her or any Republican, but she’s unlikely to get past the primaries.
Not only isn't my head exploding, while I'd never vote for her, Haley is arguably one of the less batcrap insane members of the party. If a Republican had to win she'd be among the less-bad choices (very, very faint praise, but still).

The second she crosses Trump's path, he's going to focus his entire hate machine on her and Trump and his base will absolutely mop the floor with her. She knows this, which is why she's going to avoid anything that even mildly catches Trump's attention for as long as possible.
Not to support dailymail (Broken clocks, as you know), but the West pretty much is waging an economic war against Russia right now, and are actively supplying a side with more logisitical value than any other power could ever dream of getting. Rightfully, might I add in case anyone gets any ideas.
Demanding a surrender of some kind (Like GTFOing out of all of Ukraine) for the lifting of sanctions is technically terms of negotiation that would fit the bill.

You're fine. If you can invade Russia, even do that because I don't see Russia getting the message otherwise. The only acceptable conclusion is the repatriation of all Ukraine lands and peoples and Russia making reparations and not interfering in Ukraine politics. Maybe nukes should also be returned to Ukraine is the only point of negotiation.
They asked for a ceasefire, Ukraine declined… I see no problem here. Fucked around and found out. You can’t respect a ceasefire that only you agreed to 🤣 I mean, you CAN, it’s just not intelligent.

Just next door in Iran, 60% of all college grads are women. Look where that got them today. The people are smart and fighting for their rights. Taliban doesn't want to deal with that so they go back to the old ways.
The problem isn't "beating" the Taliban the problem is how do you defeat them. For the west that means basically ending their organisation's influence in the country.

Given Afghani culture and history, to achieve that we would have had to stay there a lot longer and meddle a lot more to provide for democratic governments, abandoning tribal culture etc. Frankly we would have had to forcefully re-engineer their society to fit what we see in the west as an ideal society.

The truth is we are still present in Iraq and not Afghanistan because Afghanistan doesn't have oil. The only major export Afghanistan has is opium poppies, which the criminal Taliban will make more money off than western governments ever would.

We're talking about medicine with regard to shrooms. Like marijuana before the recent recreational legalization, it has actual medical applications that are well supported. I don't know why you'd think they're legalizing recreational use based on this article, I can only assume you didn't bother reading it. This is about coverage for medical applications. I guess you're American so imagine it's health insurance but administered by the province, that's what we're talking about.

I don't know why you'd think they're legalizing recreational use based on this article, I can only assume you didn't bother reading it. This is about coverage for medical applications.

I can see what you mean in these pics (first link) but I guess I just wasn't in the right neighborhoods? I was visiting a friend and what I saw just looked typical American. Second and third link pix look American style to me. Granted it looks nice compared to other American cities I've been to but I don't remember ever thinking it looked European.

Wtf are you talking about Boston looks very different from typical North American cities. Look at these pictures and tell me this doesn’t look European.
Jesus thats bleak. And I would say that if we are only talking about the sheer loss, it doesn't matter. But if we're talking about how to address the issue, it is important to know how the gunshot wounds break down.
If it's mostly homicide, I would say that requires a different approach to fixing the issue than if it was even a 50/50 split between suicide and homicide. As horrible and depressing as that statistic is, just "gunshot deaths" as a data point doesn't do much in addressing what we need law makers to do to solve this issue.

Where did you find that statistic? I'm genuinely curious. Also is that just gunshot wounds or do they break it down into categories like suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury?

Do you have figures for the breakdown is for homicide vs suicide vs accidents in gun deaths of children?

I stand corrected. It looks like it is a recent development in the US. It does leave off 6 years of the original age bracket. I'm not sure if that makes a difference in the rankings , but it certainly doesn't change the scale of the problem in the US.
The more fair comparison is not OIF and OEF, but the first gulf war. OIF and OEF were mostly fought against insurgent type forces and not organized militaries. Ukraine isn't a hodgepodge of insurgents, they are a standing military nation backed by a government. Desert Storm was the US lead coalition versus the standing Iraqi army. At the time, Iraq was supposed to have the 4th largest army in the world behind the big 3 super powers of the US, Russia, and China, and they were battle hardened after wars with Iran and an invasion of Kuwait. The coalition absolutely mopped the floor with the Iraqi army. There was never a question of who had air superiority and the US defeated the elite Republican Guard in less than a day during the Battle of 73 Easting. The whole ground war was pretty much over in less than 100 hours. You can read the official details of each movement . That's the war Russia expected to conduct, but they found out very quickly that they were not the US and their allies.
We gonna have to prepare for a long haul as russians are fully ready to die by the millions for no fckin reason or simply because TV said so.

The Ukrainian half of me still believes and hopes for the best and an end to the meaningless bloodshed, but as we all know life ain't sunshine and rainbows and the number of dead will grow higher by the day.

What's even more disgusting is that russians don't give a flying fuck about the dead and are happy to see another couple hundred thousand dead.

What is it with Russians and just throwing bodies into the meat grinder and hope that the other guys can’t kill them fast enough before they lose? Furthermore, what is it with old Soviet societies and just chucking piles of people at a problem and hope it gets better? Or does having some inane “Warrior mindset” philosophy mean you also have to be dumb as pig shit, too.

Kids take years to grow up. In the meantime, they’ve imported a number of furious Ukrainian prisoners of war who, if I were them, will be holding a grudge and look for any opportunity fuck Russia up. Kind of like how Jews forced to work in Nazi factories would often sabotage bombs, guns, ammunition, etc.
It certainly is a no-brainer. Walkable cities are the way of the future. It will be especially difficult for North American folks to adjust as the auto/oil industry really has people convinced that there is no alternative but that lie is slowly being exposed.
It's more about creating infrastructure and options for folks. Cars won't go away but how we move ahead is what is important. It's a build it and they will come situation...folks should be able to make choices that don't include driving a car. That's how you start.

You can start small. Cars can still be used for the relatively rare trips from rural area to cities or between cities, while cities themselves can become virtually car free. Then there's even more incentive to build rail lines connecting cities and rural areas, and car independence is extremely achievable. It's also the most efficient solution. Nations that embrace this will have an advantage over those that don't.

So wouldn't a mobility scooter or personal mobility vehicle be better for you than a car? Otherwise you have to walk much farther, eg unless a bar has a parking lot you can't go there, which limits you in some cities.

Walkable cities are indeed the future, but the problem (in Canada at least) goes much deeper. There's no transport between cities for much of the country. If you live in a rural area without a car there is literally no way to get around, inter city buses are non existent and as for trains let's say via isn't what it used to be.

But doesn’t it make the most sense to have such massive and sprawling parking lots that you then need shuttle buses to take you to and from your destination?
But there was no need for the chancellor to hurry and be the first foreign visitor after Xi's renewal of power with the terrible removal of his predecessor. Saying this as a German.
I am German to. From my perspective waiting to not be the first to meet with China is just childish. We need them and they for now at least still need us. I really hope that over the next few years the government decides to really push for a withdrawal from China at least partly. We can’t let ourselves be blackmailed into standing by and watching all the shit they do.

I agree they are sending some mixed messages and as a German it’s very annoying but as I voted for one of the coalition members I still have hope that they will do the sensible thing.

I like how everybody is judging Olaf for this even tho it’s very normal for two countries to meet when they do so much business. The strategy for the future is changing but for now Germany still relies on China. This needs to change but until then this is what needs to be done. The coalition is Germany has more or less agreed to dealing with China differently.

That’s what they are doing isn’t it? What do you imagine the change will look like? We may see them more as an adversary and a competitor but in the end we will still do business with them. No one is going to fully pull out of China.
DeSantis is a completely different caliber from all of them. He is relatively young, but not as inexperienced as Rubio. He is charismatic, though not as batshit insane as Cruz, he is liked by the establishment, though not as dead boring as Kasich or Bush.
Bush was unenthusiastic as fuck and in a year where people had enough of political dynasties he was doa.

The worst case scenario for the RNC if they do somehow wind up with a Trump/DeSantis ticket is DeSantis taking over early enough into Trump's first term that he's only able to run for re-election once.

From anecdotes I've read on /r/army and various other military subs over the years, apparently the Soviet and then Russian military did not train at all the same way that NATO and other Western militaries did. Instead of combined arms training where various elements like infantry, armor, artillery, and aviation train together, the Russians chose to train each element separately and without integrating each other into training/planning. Like each branch behaved in a way where they thought each was the key to winning a fight or was the most important.
Though their training apparently wasn't that great in the first place owing to a reliance on conscripts. When a Marshal of the Soviet Union came to the US during the Cold War on a military exchange where we sent one of our own high-ranking military officers to the USSR, the US demonstrated one of our OPFOR units to them. Using the same tactics that the Soviets published in their own manuals and info gathered from wherever we could find it. He remarked that this was the first time he'd seen a rifle motor brigade operated perfectly to their own doctrine, despite it being American unit standing before him.

It's likely a big reason why their VDV and air assaults failed. There was little to no combined arms training with regular infantry, armor support, or CAS and aerial resupply.

The issue with them is that either their tanks are by and large low quality.or they use them by themselves without proper infantry support.

Sure the Bradley killed a lot of armored vehicles in Iraq, but The Iraqis didn't have masses of artillery though. The Bradley is still a lot more squishy than a tank on today's battlefield.

A smaller number of tanks . Ifvs and infantry combined . Can defeat a larger force if its just tanks with not enough infantry.

Oddly enough the country using human wave tactics isn't using enough troops when it comes to using their tanks.
Most Americans have never left the USA. They have little clue about foreign societies. They also think that America is superior to everywhere else. This is a big part of why American leads the world in gun violence.
Yep, and you just got a slew of down votes for stating the blindingly obvious: There is absolutely no fucking way that America could transition to a zero gun society overnight.

Yes, clearly "ban all guns" would solve this from ever happening again, but there is no way to actually get there, so it's a non-starter of a discussion.

Edit: Since some people have this going over their head, it's important to realize that when I say the gun wasn't the problem, I don't mean that if it didn't exist it wouldn't have happened. That's obviously true. The point I'm making is that there's 10 other things that went wrong that caused this to happen.

You're putting it as "No gun = nobody gets shot" vs me, taking it as "No parents = child brought a gun to school.".

True. Of course there is a bit of chicken and egg there in that the sorts of people most likely to be shot are also the sorts of people most likely to own a gun. But even with all that you're more likely to be shot by a toddler than you are to shoot a criminal with your gun.
Everytime you pay for something with the dollar, you're making a transaction under god. While it doesn't say which religion this implies, it does however imply that deification is the guiding principle by which this operates.
And then you have to look at the demographic majority in religion in this country, and connect the dots.

There is a way around all of this. A way to not have to debate these freaks because they will never relent. It is to label them correctly and start a nationwide movement against them. They are a communist cult. They are using religion to cover the fact that their 7 mountains plan to control every aspect of our lives is almost exactly the communist manifesto. Just called by another name and using religion to cover it up. They absolutely worship valdmir putin and think his jurderous war raping children blowing apart children stealing children is fighting for a pro life society against western values. Communism has always been in a Culture war with western values. The republicans want to turn this county into communist Russia. It’s time to stop being so nice before it’s too late. These are commies. That all they are. They aren’t Christian’s they aren’t religious.
Usually you tell people to vote with their wallets, but if you do that here you run the risk of death. This is literally extortion. The taxpayers funded this, why are we being forced to pay more?
Yes, taxpayers did fund it. In fact, pretty much every medicine you've ever heard of has been largely, if not fully, funded through grants paid out by various governments.

Why do you think they do public funding in the first place? It's because they don't want to risk their own money on something that may not work. They're greedy as hell, so risking 0% of their wealth is a massive incentive, even if the amount of profit they're allowed to make off of something is capped.

Better idea: anything developed with public funding can have no more than a 2% profit margin. If it's entirely privately funded, go ahead, jack the price up 10,000%, be a dickbag. Even 1% of it was funded through public funding, screw off.

They're welcome to try negotiating a better deal, but my starting position is 2% cap. And even if it was negotiated to a 200% cap, it would still ultimately be a better deal for everyone that takes medicine, because they couldn't suddenly decide the drugs they make are actually worth twenty billion times more tomorrow than they were yesterday.
Maybe having all elements of society, the majority of the nation - commoners, and the holders of much of the wealth of the nation and a long view - the Lords, is a good idea?
Hmm, perhaps the House of Lords should have power restored to it… make it an actual check on the power of the Commons.

Additionally, if the House of Lords rejects a bill passed by the Commons, the Commons can pass the same bill again in the very next session and submit it directly to the monarch, bypassing the House of Lords.

There are also a bunch of types of laws that the Lords are not allowed to reject or sit on for too long (mostly related to financing) which are not related to a law abolishing the House of Lords.

Nah, I clearly didn't. Or at least, I was under the impression that there was something different about the current generation of those missiles that the Russians have access to that the US does not, something that affects the predictability, like not needing to go outside the atmosphere or something.
The fact that the US loosened its stance on Ukraine air-striking targets within Russia seems to be a reasonable indication that retaliation from Russia, nuclear or otherwise, is no longer a big concern for the western allies.

I think Russia should worry more about the allegations it has made direct attacks on the undersea cables and pipelines in the waters of other territories as some of those could trigger a NATO response, and that is a response they would not survive.

Are we going to talk about Russian allies providing military, mechanical, and supply assistance being directly involved in the war? I hope the dude knows he has completely embarrassed himself in just about every way at this point.
The worst she can do now is split the senate 50/50. That would mean committees would have to be split and a lot of things a majority could do wouldn’t be possible. She’s still finding a way to hold the senate hostage.
2) To maintain her power in the Senate right now. With a 51 seat majority her power is MUCH less diluted unless she has a partner (like Manchin) to get what she wants. As an I she can leverage the Dem's complete control over the chamber (i.e. not needing the existing power sharing agreements) by saying "give me what I want or I caucus with the Rs taking us back to 50-50".

I mean, in and of itself this doesn't change anything. She can vote however she wants to vote once she's elected. She was already unreliable for Dems and people were accusing her of being a secret conservative and whatnot. Plenty of her voters already felt betrayed.
Not in this case. Due to another Colorado law, the shooter's records were sealed and would not have raised any 'red flags' when he bought the gun. The point OP is making has nothing to do with the recent shooting.
You get that it's not the sheriff's job to initiate one of these ERPOs, right? The sheriff said that he won't initiate the seizure paperwork without due process, but will definitely execute a seizure if a warrant is issued. No warrant was issued for the shooter, and prior charges were dismissed.

Completely agree that he should have had his guns taken away, but I don't think that should be up to the sheriff to decide. In fact in this specific example the request to seize would have been denied by a court, due to the records of this guy being sealed when the case against him was dismissed. It's a tough balance. The law doesn't want to ruin someone's future over dismissed charges, but we still need to keep a record of past behavior.

The records were sealed because the case was dismissed. The case was most likely dismissed because the standoff was initiated by a single phone call made by his mother. If she says, I was mistaken, he never threatened me, or anyone else with a bomb, plus the fact that no bomb was found, would make this an incredibly hard case to prosecute.
It's already gotten people killed and will continue to do so. They aren't doing it to seem important. It's vital to understand that harm is not an unintended side effect. The cruelty and the fear and yes the dead trans kids and adults are the whole point for them.
Yes she is which makes her even more dangerous to the trans community. She is a transmedicalists which means she believes those who don’t take HRT and don’t experience Dysphoria and don’t get gender reassignment surgery aren’t trans, and being trans herself and a conservative she can convince GOP lawmakers to put up even larger boundaries and further gatekeep trans people from accessing medical care they need.

I'm 22. Currently my legal residence is New Jersey but I'm living in Arizona. With Katie Hobbs being elected, I think AZ is safe for the time being, I'm more scared of a potential full blown government ban happening one day that overrides any protections that any blue states have for trans people.

My transphobic parents (who have been begging me to stop HRT) don’t understand when I keep telling them I can’t live in Texas in the future because the state isn’t safe for me. They think I’m overreacting and they think this is a phase and I’ll detransition but this is the reality right here.
No one said any of that. And no, money cannot buy happiness but it sure can make misery a lot more comfortable. The point is that money will never solve all your problems because some of your problems have nothing to do with money.
At least not until he got home and felt some hunger and some thirst. He suddenly realized that it was all but impossible to satisfy them: both his food and his drinks turned into gold as well, the minute they touched his mouth, his teeth, or his tongue.

Guarantee it won't. It will solve a lot of 'em but if you had enough money, you'd still find issues. They're just not the most pressing issues right now.

Remember King Midas from Greek mythology? Midas asked Dionysus that he should be able to turn into gold everything he touched. His wish granted, Midas went away trying it out. He first turned some twigs into gold and then some stones. Afterward, he did the same to an ear of corn and some apples. There was no end to his rejoicing.

Glad we can get sentiments and emotions out of the way. I don’t disagree with your observations at all. In fact I see us in a lot of alignment and also I don’t even know if there’s anything else to answer to here. Lol.
The media makes the country seem much worse than it is. Think about your everyday life and then consider what life might be like in Latin America or the Middle East.
This country has tremendous problems with greed and inequality, but hopefully your experience isn’t too terrible. Not that you need to hear this, but there are lots of places where it’s much worse (not that the US and the West didn’t help make those places that way.).

He didn’t block it. It’s against the law. They had to change the law to allow a strike or try to force what the workers wanted on the railroads. That’s what they tried and it failed because of an actual center-right dem and a bunch of fucking traitorous republicans.

If Democrats had ANY spine, they'd FORCE the Republicans to vote no on all of it together, but they didn't. Neither party cares about the working class when it comes to this sort of thing. I'm done voting for either party. When you guys are done being brainwashed as much as the Trump cult is, maybe this country will improve before I finally get the fuck out of here to a better country.

However, after industry pressure, the final measure ended up narrowly focused on the transport of crude oil and exempting trains carrying many other combustible materials, including the chemical involved in this weekend’s disaster.
Did the Biden administration take any steps to attempt to change anything? The question of whether they could have done anything is a separate one, I'm wondering if there's anything to show they even tried.

Profit seeking businesses are going to seek profits in every way we allow them to. The only way we can stop things like this happening is by creating regulations and laws that outlaw the negligence that allowed it to happen and then enforcing those laws. Trump and Biden both deserve plenty of blame for failing to do that.

With his role backs on safety regulations, yeah he is more to blame that Biden. I swear, all Republicans are doing is just rigging everything to be as dangerous as possible and when it fails blame the Democrats.

Not saying republicans aren't as much to blame here, clearly they are. But we could have stopped this. Democrats CHOSE not to. ....because the economy.
The margin is so small that I think they'll have a failed impeachment article. Any republican in swing districts won't want to collar themselves with a ridiculous impeachment effort. But McCarthy will almost certainly have to promise to bring impeachment to the floor to placate the nutjobs in his party to get their votes for speaker.
That’s what I mean, even if the impeachment vote passes in the house, the next step in the process is the senate, which wont have the required votes.

Even if they pass impeachment, it'll go to the senate, won't reach 2/3 majority required to impeach and by the rules we're playing by now, that means that Biden is innocent because Trump apparently is and that will be the end of that?

It’s political circus, the GOP will try to impeach Biden 2 (or more times) so it takes the mantle of most impeached President away from Trump/the R side, and instead they can call Biden the most impeached President ever. And since much of their base doesn’t understand impeachment it will be a “win” for them.

It’s still insane to me that they want to impeach him over something his son did while he wasn’t in office. Again if we’re playing by the same rules, that would mean we could again impeach Trump over the whole Russian “adoption” scandal his son got involved in while he was President-elect, that his son openly admitted too.
You’d have to be crazy to not consider a few plausible options, Luke Russian rigging some kind of dirty bomb that would be explained away as ‘Ukraine was planning to detonate it in Moscow and it went early’ to blowing the dam, or simply allowing Ukraine to take it and then trying to flatten it with every piece of artillery they have. Thankfully, Ukraine seem to have decent intelligence and arn’t just sailing in there.
Ukraine has the best intelligence. USA itself helping with intelligence is amazing but I bet other western countries like France, Germany, and the UK are helping too.

If this war has taught me anything, it's that Moscow is a piece of that will say anything and everything, if it means gaining an advantage against its enemies. No matter how false or ridiculous it may be.

It’s not even just unreliable, it’s always a lie. They’re not even good at misinformation - they always lie. Back to back we heard intelligence reports their special forces were digging in and placing traps, then Russia says ‘oh no, no, no, we’re leaving, honest!’.

I would think given Russia’s actions the only sensible course for ukraine would be to try and take the damn and then surround and cut off the city and push the line further back beyond Kherson before trying to take it? Tbh It seems street to street fighting through the city rigged for defence would be exactly what Russia would want them to do, and we’ve seen again and again the Russian boots in the ground fall into disorganised panic as soon as it looks like they might get surrounded.

of course…Ukraine has not been this successful because they were lucky…Russia may leave the troops where they are, start retreating some in a fake out move or even go on an offensive or any combination but that’s at their peril and thus far Russia has considered their troops to be quite expendable. Ukraine has been consistently better and I hope that don’t change.
I really want them to vote on the 30% consumption tax now because the CBO would have to score it, and show (once again) how stupid the Republican think tanks are.
Given the shit show that was the election of the Speaker there's more than one Republican dumb enough to cause a default simply because they want to be the center of attention.

the thing is if you let them reap the consequences and republicans are at fault, they will never admit it and you know damn well their propaganda right wing media machine will tell their bad faith viewers it was the democrats fault entirely and all they wanted to do is be fiscally responsible.

then despite hundreds of articles proving it was republicans who let us default, that won’t change the minds of the idiots who take the lies from fox at face value and continue to parrot the talking point even if every single real news organization in the world will point that it was republicans who let us default.

At this point, I doubt it; you'd want the media to be blaming the GOP for this pointless game and threatening to shut down the government and take money away from workers, crash the economy, and wipe out everyone's 401k and retirement, but the media focuses on "debt ceiling showdown', like it's entertainment.

Advertisements in the newspaper/magazines they read? Commercials during shows they are known to watch? Basically, wherever their eyes go, they should see negative coverage of the GOP debt ceiling debacle. Put it right outside their local office, their home, and their DC office.

Honestly, if want to get the message out and move past it, probably people need to just group up and pool money for billboards across DC, government employee heavy districts, and competitive districts (especially republican held). If all McCarthy and his ilk see everywhere they go, are billboards bashing them, they will likely cave.
The Chinese have few allies... what?? North Korea, a depleted and embarrassed Russia, a dangerous Iran, but those allies alone are nothing compared to the alliances the west have with NATO, and Oceania countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Malaysia and even India..
3rd.. the Chinese military would be crippled for a decade(s)... Like Russia's path right now.. because the United States and our NATO Alliance would choke and strangle Chinese military, industry, trade routes.

Lets hope it NEVER comes to this... there has been peace on the Chinese mainland since it's Civil War ended in 1949, where the defeated Chiang Kai-shek escaped to Taiwan and founding of that independent nation island.

Fun fact, from 1949-1971, Republic of China (Taiwan) was the sole representative of China in United of Nation, while PRC was established in 1949.

It's the matter between ROC and PRC from the beginning. And ROC was also responsible for PRC's birth by exerting too much McCarthyism internally to Chinese people during post WW2 era, furthermore people just revolted against ROC (with that to one of the biggest issue, along with poverty, inflations, corruptions...etc).
The 18% was unsustainable and frankly unfair to the rest of the country. So it was both out of practicality (lower interest rate is still better than none in the case of bankrupting the funds) and making public servant benefits a little more in line with broader society.
But taking a step back and looking at reality, the alternative would’ve been the funds go bankrupt and don’t get paid out. “It should be honored,” sure, but how? A restructuring was long overdue, and though unpopular, I’d argue it was very necessary.

It’s a somewhat understandable but also really irrational sentiment. I also have family members affected by this policy.

I have family members affected by this (or another policy change similar to this). Retired teachers. Pensions almost cut in half AFTER retirement, and as their only source of income after retirement. One of them thinks it’s injustice to drastically change their pensions after having worked 30+ years as a public school teacher. Thinks something that’s written down on paper shouldn’t be changed. They now have a fervent hatred for the tw government and sometimes jokes about welcoming ccp rule since they believe the ccp won’t fuq with their pensions. Says if tw falls to the ccp it would be its own government’s fault.
The Czechs, Poles, and Lithuanians (not to mention a few others) know what it is like to be under Russia's oppression. They don't want to ever be back there again.
They don't want to see it. It's just kind of a bummer that even younger generation tends to believe state news and TV even though you can imagine they are spreading straight fake news there.

It's not putin blasting houses with MLRS', I suppose? Not putin flying in strategic bombers targeting electric power grids and malls, right? Get this point out of your head - ruzzian nation wants to destroy Ukrainians. It doesn't matter who rules, ruzzians always wanted to suppress and eliminate Ukraine.

I am not asking questions about Germans and British, 'cause they are not the people raping and killing my people. I am asking questions about and most important TO ruzzians, and the answers are not great. So, yeah, people bred on Soviet Union and ruzzian Empire glory cannot be in any case adequate, because their history includes killing of Ukrainians and the thesis of "brotherly nation - one nation", which is complete bullshit.

Yep. And in 1917 it was the cossacks turning against the police and joining the people that made the difference. It's really hard to imagine something similar happening in putin's russia.
Personally I can't imagine Russia is going to be demilitarized like the axis powers. It would take multiple significant changes - not least regime change, culture, voluntary de-nuclearlisation (I don't believe this will happen anywhere following several examples including Ukraine itself).

They will be on their own to deal with these issues and even their pre-war thinking and practices toward mental health and law enforcement were hardly progressive. Things will only get worse for Russia.

But why is wishing Russia would "cease to exist" that bad? I mean, personally I don't see what the alternative is, as in it's not gonna be annexed by another country, and it splitting up into multiple countries isn't any help either. But Russia as it is today -should- collapse. Just hope there will be a better Russia to take its place...
I mean we will see how much influence Belarus actually has over it's army. Considering there is a Belarusian military unit in Ukraine fighting Russian that can always return home I doubt they actually deploy or it lasts long than Belarus government. Also a civil war in Belarus would force Russia to divert military power to Belarus.
I think now we can see the Russians have an attrition based strategy, they must want to pull the Belarusians into this.

In fact, the very prospect of a Russian lead push from Belarus must make UKR high command salivate when the alternative is the ongoing attritional slugfest in the Donbas.

I personally think Luka should stay out until he sees if the new western equipment leads to a Russian defeat, if the Russians are still fighting then Belarus should join the Russian side.

Well Ukraine will have a large number of troops near the border with Belarus, because that's where Russia launched the original attempt to take Kyiv from last year.

At the end of the day it will only take a few more of these cases and India can forget ever exporting drugs to the west.

And similarly US needs to better enforce it's drug controls. Do remember that when Pfizer was told to validate their vaccine before usage in India, they pulled out. As much as I want export controls in India to be improved, the US and any other country for that matter has to put in quality checks to ensure that they are not importing garbage especially when it comes to medicines and other important goods.

In this specific case, the onus of enforcement was on FDA in US as the company in question only had an export license and did not produce in the Indian market, leading to it not being checked by Indian authorities (medical ones especially).

Literally everyone with a functioning brain already knows how corrupt, traitorous, and bigoted the GOP is.
Aside from that, there must be a following of those constituents that truly lack any moral fiber in their being, and are instead emboldened by corrupt, hateful Republican values.

Democrats should take advantage of these moments to show Americans how Republicans are still very much a clear and present danger to our democracy, let alone that they don’t have any actual solutions for our issues.

The real danger in all of this isn't that so many Republicans are showing themselves to be weak misguided and cowards. The real danger is the more that Trump stretches the boundaries the more these ideas become mainstream and normalize. It's like the parent who tells their child to be home by 10:00pm and then the child says 11 and then 12 and then 1am and then 2 and then 3 and at first you're shocked but then the new norm becomes 2:00 a.m. because nobody stuck to 9pm. Look at how far we've come where people can openly admire and praise Adolf Hitler and nobody speaks up and condemned Jews and Blacks and attack LGBTQ people and Hispanics etc. The last seven years have been absolutely horrific and are only getting worse. Amazing how the originalists that revere the Constitution and the Founding Father's intention are now silent when one of their own advocates shredding the document.
When will the africans apologize for selling all their own race off? The tribes would sell of slaves (Spoils of war) for guns, food, etc. Since currency wasn't a huge thing there.
Because there wasn't any, countries at the time. More large tribal and nomadic of the African continent. But these tribes traded away most of their slaves (spoils of war) to Europeans for weapons, food and other luxuries.

So sorry that they’ll find a way to turn some of those riches into reparations for the survivors of those whose lives were stolen during the slave trade?

It a good thing that apologies are being made, slavery is an unethical, immoral and evil practice that dehumanises people to tools/ cattle. The fact that slavery excised under law in the Dutch colonies demands an apology and quite some inward reflection about our history. However….

When will white people stop deflecting when other people push colonizing nations to make amends for the injustices they perpetuated? Some Africans participated in the slave trade, yes, but by no means was it all African peoples. Some Africans actively fought it. The Christian king of Kongo even petitioned a European power to end it. Not to mention, I don’t think any of the enslaved people were fond of the institution. Nor were their descendants. On top of all this, let’s remember who it was that maintained slavery over the centuries and who “refined” it into a particularly brutal and race-based caste system. It wasn’t Africans, who were also brutally colonized and genocided, but white people. So let’s stop repeating these racist gotchas, and move towards a more equitable and just world together.

So you think Africans and the African diaspora are better off today after centuries of enslavement, racial profiling, redlining, lynching, race riots, economic extraction, and so forth than if slavery never occurred, Africa was never colonized, and Black people developed according to their own terms? I’m sorry but that’s hard to believe, and I’m afraid most other people of African descent do not feel the same.

But even if it somehow did end up better for Africans, that still doesn’t make white people’s actions justified or any less deserving of apology. That’s like if someone took a bullet for you and saved your life and you said to their family, “Stop crying over them, cuz at least I’m alive.” Like, yeah, it’s cool that they saved your life, but the fact the other person is dead is still a tragedy and the shooter needs to be reprimanded.
>Secondly, Belarusian society is overwhelmingly against the country’s participation in the war – more than 90 per cent reject the idea of joining on the side of Russia. Sending Belarusians to war could therefore provoke a serious wave of discontent within the country, even more so than Putin’s mobilisation has in Russia. The Belarusian democratic forces in exile would likely use this to overthrow the Lukashenka regime.
So, the way I see it Lukashenko will not risk sending belorussians to this was. He does however serve a purpose. The ambiguity around the situation forces the Ukrainians to keep significant forces in reserve, because they cannot risk being invaded from Belorussia, thus making it a bit easier on the Russians. I think Lukashenko will periodically do things like speak of possible actions, or move forces around and such, just to keep the facade. But, I don’t think he’ll risk it.

I don't think they could kill Lukashenko. It's too high of a risk for Putin since he couldn't guarantee the next person ruling the country would bend the knee. Furthermore he wouldn't be in able to quell an uprising due to his military being tied up in Ukraine. If Putin tried to take the country by force he would be met with a serious insurgency from Belarusians and again wouldn't have the military for it. The only way would be to incorporate Belarusian military into the Russian military, but there would likely be decent.

I'd add that Belarus are also helping to train Russian soldiers, and to equipment from their own stocks.

I'd also add that even if the war were popular in Belarus. Why would they attack? They will lose troops, lose equipment, lose money, potentially lose stuff on their side of the border. And for what? They won't get any territory. They won't receive anything. There is nothing to be gained.

I think pretty similar to what you are thinking. Lukashenko is hoping to take Belarus as close to fighting with Russia as he can, without actually going to war. That way he gets to be pro-Russia and get support from Russia, without the downsides of sending people into war.
It is absolutely possible and has been done in previous wars. Just put a stiff pressure plate or vibration trigger under a track sleeper and buried explosives next to it. Sometimes such devices are even equipped with counters to give the sabotage team more time to escape and obfuscate, when the explosives were placed. 1 train, wait, 2 trains wait, 3rd train explode. Given one can set arbitrary counter, it is impossible to tell when the explosives were placed.
Ofcourse these days with FLIR cameras and drones it is little bit tricky prospect. Burying a mine to be waiting under the rails takes time and one might not have time. With one sticking out like a sore thumb on a FLIR image while on exposed position at the rail tracks.

If possible they should mine the tracks to cause derailement. It takes alot more effort to repair and clear the tracks.

It seems risky to stay near the track long enough to mine it. It might take several days and the trips back and fourth might be suspicious. I'd like to think the resistance made the most of their resources.

no, slavery is the practice of compelling someone to work without proper compensation. What you're referring to is chattel slavery, the most common type practiced in the US at least, whereby the slaves exist as a form of transferable property that legally belong to whoever has bought them.

Obviously it's not "kidnap African people and force them into slavery on a plantation", but it's 'modern' slavery. And it is constitutionally slavery. Even the people back when the 13th amendment was being written considered it slavery enough to include it in the Constitution as an exception.

Prisoners should have a right to be able to choose to find jobs, in fact in an ideal world that could even be good (helping prisoners reintegrate back into society, find work after their imprisonment, and just make money while in-prison). But forced prison labor for no payment or very little payment is horrible and should be considered slavery.
And the 2nd part, 'Chinese' can mean many things. In fact, I just used "Chinese threat' but I did not mean Chinese people but instead China's government. But 'Chinese' can also mean people from China and adhering to China's values or it can mean people of Chinese race which can be Chinese-Canadians or Chinese-Americans or Taiwanese or Chinese Malaysians etc.
I 100% agree in the two major points you made. In trying to avoid being seen as racist, Canada and many others turn a blind eye to the Chinese threat.

The compulsion that leads Canadians to say, "oh but I'm not racist though," is also leading Canadians to turn a blind eye to Chinese threats.

And not everything is about race, or ranking people's humanity by their physical form or ethnic roots. Sometimes "Chinese" means "originating from the Chinese state and adhering to its values.".

It's probably downvoted because there's no explanation about what Trudeau had to do with it. He's not great but please be specific if you want to educate people about this.
Yeah, we've been gifted the gutting of the Russian military for pennies on the dollar. We're getting to test logistical and weapons systems as well as tactics in drone warfare. At least for drones, we're also building the muscle for doing extremely rapid weapons development and procurement outside the normally stultifying pentagon processes. It's like a war game to prep us for an eventual conflict with China.
I think China has very close eyes on how this is going and is really thinking about if it's worth it to invade Taiwan. I wouldn't want to go to war with China but would support it if they invade Taiwan like Russia is trying with Ukraine.

2025-2027 is what’s being predicted when China will invade Taiwan. They are making preparations at an alarming rate and in 4-5 yrs they will be ready. It’s scary to think about.

I agree. We are trying to deplete the Russian military so they can’t launch an invasion like this in the near future. It’s a war of attrition at this point and Russia is losing tons of equipment. They can’t product computer chips either so all those new aged tanks and rocket systems can’t be replaced. A drawn out war is bad for Russia and that’s what we’re doing. Sending enough aid to keep Ukraine fighting but not enough to win in the near term.

In the meantime supplying Ukraine with equipment, weapons and training helps them defend themselves.

This is a very poor take. The US and the rest of NATO have not gotten directly involved in an effort to avoid nuclear escalation. Ukraine might be putting serious hurt on Russian forces but Russia isn't facing an imminent threat to their territory from Ukraine and at least this far has felt threatened enough to employ nuclear weapons, US/NATO involvement would change that.
If enough people lie and cheat there way into congress as Republicans, take committee appointments and then consistently vote liberally, we might have an ethics dept again. And also get shit done.
Republicans want power and don’t care about morals, national security, etc. so fuck them at their own game. Run everyone as a Republican.

If you care about the country do it. If republicans don’t care about who you really are then why not lie all the way to office before voting for voting rights, abortion rights, universal healthcare. Show the GOP that lying to get elected can backfire tremendously on them.

The fact that anybody in America can lie to become an elected lawmaker and then hold that position is an absolute contradiction. It shows up the total immoral hypocrisy that has now become the ideology of the Republican party.
Sort of sure it took me a minute to see it and that's with everyone saying that the crossword having one in it. I mean they could have made it look a lot more like one if that was the intention.
He has been using calling people anti-Semitic when they criticize him or Israel for years now. So at this point I would argue that he almost doesn't have to say it to say it.

I'm not going to argue about this. You will believe what you believe. I choose to look at the data and the facts, and base my belief on it. Long live the people of Israel. All of them. May a path of peace be found, and healing slowly come to those who have been wronged by the perversion of a noble idea.

I have been to Auschwitz and Dachau. I am deeply invested in the history and plight of the tribes, and the modern Jewish people. The way you presented your interpretation of Zionism, however, is a perfect example of how a bias has been engendered into its discussion that makes it difficult to talk about the exploitations, violence and oppression that Zionism empowered under corrupt Israeli officials. And to say the Zionism is "literally just" one thing, the hope for a homeland, you are either unaware of choosing willful ignorance because of your bias.

Seem your problem is not with the ethnostate part but with the Jewish part , I don't see you condem the actual ethnostates in the middle east just the Jewish country.

Maybe don't refer to the one Jewish nation as "demonic," considering the historical tropes of Jews as inherently evil/having horns/being the "synagogue of Satan.".

Yeah it was such a privilege to be genocided, made to be second-class citizens, and kept out of educational institutions with Jew quotas. What a privilege /s.
And I don't think that after Putin's death next leader would be someone who loves West. BTW nuclear disarmament should be 1st condition before ending sanctions.
It was not very kind answer. You should realise that if we won't completely destroy Russian economy than after few years they will start this shit all over again. In my opinion Putin is our guarantee that Russia will fall to the very bottom.

I agree 100% but after total bancruptcy of Russia. It will be much more painful for him to die knowing that he won't be remembered as new Peter the Great but pathetic destructor of Russia.

It will be much better if Putin will stay as a ruler of Russia. It is in fact the worst scenario for Russia's military power, economy and prestige. They will suffer so much losses in any field that they won't be threat for any neighbour country for at least two decades. Long live Putin. His death could give Russia chance to undo this stupid falling into chasm.

But, when Putin dies, they will use him as a scape goat and reason to stop the bleeding, and try to fix their economy.

Railroad owners knew Congress and Biden had their back. They knew they never had to negotiate in good faith. Why give Rail workers time off when they didn't have too? If Rail companies knew Congress would prevent a strike, then the union never had any leverage and the Rail companies counted on it.
The law putting the rail workers union under the power of the government is what needs to be addressed. That power forces the hand of all in government to sacrifice the few for the good of the many. Democrats were never going to have the votes for additional sick days, even without a filibuster, as was seen by the sick day votes. They made the call to get them what they could before the house switches parties and the rail workers would get less after the economy suffered. The Rail Bosses and Republicans would happily let Americans suffer for a month while pressure mounted on Biden to fix it. Until the power is taken out of governments hands to intervene rail workers are at a severe disadvantage unless Dems hold a super majority.
Frankly, I prefer the parliamentary approach of the party selecting the executive nominee. We (the US) place way too much emphasis on selecting the executive who has relatively little power in our government.
I didn’t call it a stronghold. There is a big difference between having a foothold - somewhere that they’ve established some level of influence- and a stronghold. There is no progressive foothold in SC. I said Biden wants to start somewhere he (or his chosen successor, probably Harris) will win.

But you are right it's probably about the payback and, since Biden will likely run unopposed, mostly for show.

Ahs besides even if Trump ran independent that's still no reason for Biden to run again. Biden has been privatizing Medicare, siding against unions and paid sick leave, and raising inflation through massive increases in medicare premiums instead of using March in rights to lower prescription drug costs.

Regardless of the occasion I feel like anyone flying a Russian flag at the moment can fuck off. Flying a Russian flag can only mean one thing right now, and that is war support.
There are athletes competing in esports that choose to not be represented by the russian flag due to their stance against the war so u know, they could do that.

The Russian people do need to feel consequences and having no sports would be something that’s not actually something that effects their lives but remind how their country has been shamed on world stage. Instead for being able to live in a bubble where Russian athletes get treated the same on world stage. Also they Russian athletes commonly use doping anyway, so not a loss from the sports perspective.

Majority of nations would not have voted to condemn USA (and plenty were it’s allies), Russia literally has been condemned by most countries in UN. I would not have an issue with countries condemned by majority of UN causing restrictions for its athletes anyway, and if same had happened for US why would that have been bad in your view anyway? The athletes are there to represent the country. If they really need careers in sports they can move elsewhere and get another citizenship. That would solve the unfairness on a individual level.
More like Russia being cut off like North Korea. For this to be a proper cold war, Russia would need to be a near peer adversary, which suggssting nowadays would rightly get you laughed out of a room.
Yeah but arms control agreements between DC and Moscow were in some ways characteristic of the Cold War. What we have now is Moscow trying to rearm, gambling that the West has no appetite to do the same, and won’t reciprocate with an arms race.

And Russia isn't going to be able to crank out the nearly 4,000 missiles required to throw everything they have any time soon. I'd be surprised if most of their arsenal, which is liquid fuelled and takes a lot more to maintain, credibly works given that our Minutemen III are roughly the same age, we take impeccable care of them, and are solid fuel, still occasionally have issues.

That's fine, they have no way to build the launch systems en masse again to take advantage of their stockpiled warhead advantage over us for the very foreseeable future. They've already been trying to circumvent MAD and treaties associated to contain it by getting strategic hypersonics to work, which luckily are still a long long ways off too.

They have a far larger arsenal on paper, but START made sure they don't have the launch systems active to take advantage of that.
Also forgetting to mention, instigating the world's largest and most effective military alliance isn't exactly the best idea when their military is getting embarrassed in ukraine.
I have no doubt that Poland doesn’t want war, but your government has always been a great ally as far as standing with NATO and Ukraine against Russian aggression. And there are polish volunteers in Ukraine are there not?

Honestly a part of it stems a lot from our (American) relatively common feeling of protectiveness over our Eastern European allies compared to the wealthier nations to your west. Some of us really appreciate how outspoken Poland and the Baltic states have been during this conflict, and the fact that your country actually meets the NATO GDP to defense requirements is not lost on those of us who stay informed.

Even though they're not talking about Poland at all (read the article), Poland is a member of NATO and thus the accusation would be accurate, even if false.

See, I'm teaching by example so he will learn. I also never said that ALL americans want war and says those things. However the people that do say these things here are almost always americans, thats just an observation.

I see this narrative about Poland a lot here, guessing it's mostly from americans. I swear they get hard while they're thinking of it.
This is about allowing a country to defend itself from a nuclear armed government breaking all international laws and straight up annexing and trying to take over another territory that is not theirs. We have the largest military of any other nation in the planet, so much so that all we have to send these guys are old shit we don't need anymore to stop Russia from gaining territory and bordering other nato countries and you want to argue that's a bad thing and we should just let Russia do whatever it wants? Fuck you.
Because they are correct on this issue. It's really that simple. And the right wing bad faith audit is what's being pushed for and what you are defending in this thread.

I actually think you might not know enough about theory to understand what you are implying, but what happened in maidan doesn't change what needs to be done here. You might be a communist for it's aesthetics, but by propping up Russian you kill off any argument you may have against supplying defensive weaponry to Ukraine. Propping up Russian would be infinitely worse for geopolitics in this era.

This itself is Russian propaganda. Russia's little prop boy was forced out by the Ukrainians who then held a perfectly legal and democratic vote where they elected zelensky entirely democratically. It was the will of the people. Putin's little puppet boy was ousted and ran away of his own accord to avoid being prosecuted and jailed by the people of Ukraine after ramping up violence against protesters. You are falling for Russian talking points my friend. The people of Ukraine have had incredibly strong opinions about being attacked and annexed by Russia and it is clear as crystal which side they take. You may not care about the people of Ukraine enough and want to completely disregard what they want and voted for, but good thing the world doesn't side with you and your fascist opinions. Ukraine is not on your side. The Ukrainian people are not on your side. May sunflowers grow from your corpse one day.

By literally disregarding any understanding of legal standing. A 1L from a half-decent program could explain why none of the plaintiffs should be able to present a case.
I want to believe this, but they also don't feel bound in any meaningful way by precedent. They could allow this argument to pass muster (despite it having been knocked down in a taxpayer context already), then just refuse to hear cases that carry the argument to its logical endpoint.

It's harder to argue (the already weak argument) that you were arbitrarily excluded on that distiction, and it feels much closer to a "general greivance"/taxpayer standing which has been excluded.

And the arbitrary exclusion part comes from Biden initally saying FFEL loans would be eligible and then, when some of those lenders sued, they overnight without any notice announced FFEL loans are ineligble to avoid standing from those lenders. It's hard to argue that decision is not arbitrary considering the only motivation was to avoid a plaintiff having standing. Especially in the context of administrative procedure where you kind of have a presumption of arbitrariness if you don't go through the proper notice and comment process (which did not happen here for the initial forgiveness or for the overnight exclusion of FFEL loans).

Not to burst your bubble, but there are already studies on this 😅 According to the studies, happiness does increase with more money, BUT only up to about $70k-$100k per year in the developed world (depends on the country). When you have money to save, invest, vacation, and to meet all your needs with ease like food, Healthcare, shelter, etc. happiness increases dramatically. Beyond that, it is just the addition of zeros. Conclusion: Money doesn't buy happiness, but being poor causes misery 😕.
These "leaders" see increases year after year with out fail they get bonuses that would be life changing for regular people and yet money doesn't buy happiness.

IMO after financial security there are some pretty harsh diminishing returns on the happiness additional money on its own will bring. However, money can enable you to pursue other interests that might make you much happier, if you have such interests in the first place.

Just as a silly one-off example, when I finally bought a nice electric guitar after playing the same Squier Strat for half my life it absolutely breathed new life into that hobby. That's a (relatively) cheap one but I could see there being more expensive examples if you like to climb mountains around the world or something.
We should also count ammunition from Belarus, from which Russia has taken more than 20,000 tons of ammunition. We don’t know how large stocks are in Belarus, but by transferring its armored equipment and ammunition to Russia, Belarus remains a major resource.
Russia is running out of ammunition was a logistic issue due to overextension and lack of preparation in push model of Russian army. News reporters run with the first part without understanding.

I don't think Russia can easily run out of ammo either, but it can run out of soldiers if the war continues for a long time. What's the latest count on Russian casualties? Well over 100K? Who in their right mind would voluntarily want to fight for Russia?

I've seen videos of conscripts trying to run away - it's hilarious and sad at the same time. Can you imagine being forced to have to fight and die for your country, a country that is not worth fighting for. I mean, Russia could be a great country, but its governance for centuries has been abysmal.
Interestingly, the American born Spinal Tap actor Christopher Guest is/was part of the UK’s House of Lord’s and holds the title of The Right Honorable Lord Haden-Guest, a title inherited from his late father who was a British United Nations diplomat.
"There's no question that the old system was unfair. I mean, why should you be born to this? But now it's all just sheer cronyism. The prime minister can put in whoever he wants and bus them in to vote. The Upper House should be an elected body, it's that simple.".

It's more a reflection on the fact that movement to remove the House of Lords is almost purely symbolic and will waste political capital that could be better spent improving the output of the real source of power, the House of Commons.
Just remember, he could be removed from the House anytime, if the DOJ did their fucking jobs and enforced the 14th Amendment. Hell, the Dems had 2 years in Congress to do it themselves.
The rules are not the same for Dems and Republicans. Dems have to walk the fine line of civility. They're not all the best people. There are wealthy democrats too that fuck around. But when it comes down to the policies that are put forth, Democrats are significantly better. Many of them actually reflect on past positions, learn from their mistakes, apologize, and move forward to better represent what we want.

In the end, the story becomes about how Dems shouldn't label the establishment GOP what they are: fascist bigots keen on establishing an authoritarian gov't. This leads to people being able to hide behind the excuse of "politics is so tribal and dysfunctional" as a reason not to vote. And round and round we go.

It's not a major news story anymore. And if Democrats get aggressive when responding to the GOP's bullshit everyone will clutch their pearls about how sad the state of politics is or "Look at how terrible the Democrats are for calling Republicans fascists." Which is out of context because it's not necessarily the electorate, but the GOP politicians that are fascists. I'm pretty sure that a good chunk of their base just doesn't get it that they're supporting fascism. The ones that do are complicit (most likely the wealthy) are just looking to exploit whatever pro rich asshole policies the GOP passes.

And if Democrats get aggressive when responding to the GOP's bullshit everyone will clutch their pearls about how sad the state of politics is or "Look at how terrible the Democrats are for calling Republicans fascists." Which is out of context because it's not necessarily the electorate, but the GOP politicians that are fascists. I'm pretty sure that a good chunk of their base just doesn't get it that they're supporting fascism. The ones that do are complicit (most likely the wealthy) are just looking to exploit whatever pro rich asshole policies the GOP passes.
At this point anything on right wing media or that comes out of the mouth of a Republican politician, I assume is a lie. “Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.”.
I saw the video, just another imagine of why war is terrible for all people regardless if you have your hands up in surrender or not.
It sucks to be taken out while laying on the ground with your arms up but it sucks a whole lot more to accept a false surrender and be ambushed.

I mean when a group of soldiers signal their surrender but then one of them pops out a gun and starts shooting... no one surrendered... there were no prisoners of war... the people killed were, willing or not, active combatants in a war their country started and the guy who shot decided to actively continue.

I would be able to agree with you IF they had all been searched and were all restrained. As it was, any one of these men could have still been armed and all of them were still potentially dangerous as the surrender was being violated.

Accepting surrender is a life or death situation especially when restraining a force larger than your own. If the situation degrades you need to eliminate the threat and secure the area, and it looks like this is what the Ukrainian/machine gunner did. You cannot be certain especially in the moment that the Russian soldiers didn't have grenades or pistols hidden. We will never know the plan the Russians had, if this was perfidy gone wrong. Most likely this was a lone Russian who got the rest of his mates killed by committing perfidy.
Tetra Bio-Pharma has cannabis clinical trials currently underway against morphine, oxycodone and Hydromorphone. Will be a huge boost to them. They also have a separate partnership with Dr. Lance LIOTTA at George Mason University for cannabis based ARDS-003 which has shown promise against sepsis and immunomodulatory effects and halting the cytokine storm of covid. Bargain basement prices for the stock now but not for long methinks. They will be receiving a DIN from Health Canada in near future for Dronabinol and just won an international award in Malta for best cannabis medical device. Plus have patnerships everywhere including with DanCanna Pharma who just won the EU GMP designation . They have a ton of intellectual property, multiple patents and five Orphan Drug Designations.
Lets not forget the clinical work Tetra Bio-pharma is doing with Dr. Sue SISLEY for the treatment of PTSDin veterans. People tend to mistakenly treat this as a weed stock but it is a biopharma stock using clinical research to push cannabis forward as an opioid replacement.

The only reason you’re starting to think he doesn’t want to take any real action on cannabis is just because he doesn’t want to take any real action on cannabis.

I'm starting to think he doesn't want to take any real action on cannabis. I wonder if any of his friends or family are making money from the incarcerated, non-violent drug offenders who get thrown in cages while we spend all that money to "research" shit that we already know. This is dumb.

And before any "its a step in the right direction", tell that to the disproportionately affected minorities who get their lives ruined over a plant that god created.
Two things - Russia didn’t attain air superiority even before western weapons poured into Ukrainian; Russia bombed civilian targets from the very beginning of the war.
So Russia didn't have air superiority over the whole Ukraine, but they were actively blocking Ukrainian air force from doing anything. There were days Ukraine could send 5 sorties and Russia were able to send over 300 that day. Russia could even send T-95s with iron bombs to Mariupol and Ukraine could do nothing about it.

For me this translates into the point, that if we want Ukraine to win this war (quickly), the west should send more AntiAirDefence. It is the least aggressive step, which yields the best results.

Just like the US did in the korean war, where they pretty much leveled the korean peninsula with sheer air power without smart bombs. The only thing that stops them from doing so, are a few SAMs.

They still should be considered capable in air-to-air combat, also if they manage to empty the ukrainian Air Defences, they might have a real shot at stoping the Ukraine from winning this war indefinitely by disrupting supply lines. Because Russia still has very effective ways of "dumb" Air-to-Ground attacks.

But Russia didn't lose their planes to air-to-air kills but to SAMs and Manpads, so their advantage wasn't worth much.

They didn't say modern aircraft, they said more modern aircraft than Ukraine and that is undoubtedly true. Ukraine largely has older variants of Russian/Soviet planes. The main differences being that Russian planes have more effective counter measures vs AA missiles and longer weapon range.
1. Primary targets are substations that power military installations, not generation, so unless civilians are on the same grid, they're mostly not affected (grid failure due to suddenly lost of load on the system triggering safety shutdowns not withstanding).
There's really no "military infrastructure" in relation to Ukraine war on Moscow. Hitting Belgorod? Yes, and Ukraine had been doing that. There's really no reason to hit Moscow unless you intend to take out Kremlin.

I am not sure why you took my comment as hitting Moscow. There is infrastructure critical for the Russian military to function. Take those out. School buildings are not critical infrastructure.

But more importantly, cutting off Russian supply lines originating in Russia is more important for Ukraine.

Striking targets inside Russia can be defensive as well. Ukrainian troops need not cross the border. But they can use long range weapons to take out missile batteries and other critical military infrastructure.

Because the US supplied the long range weapons with strings attached... no strikes inside Russia using their weapons, for fear of escalating the conflict.

As the article said, "draw a line in the sand so to speak and tell Russia if they import and use Iranian SRBMs, the U.S. would supply Ukraine with ATACMS.".
China is by far the largest polluter on Earth. They have 5x as many coal fire power plants than the next closest country (India) with plans to open a few hundred more in ‘23.
Oh I was previously unaware that global warming and climate change or whatever the new terminology is gives two fucks about per capita numbers.

Beyond that they remain the largest polluter and it’s cute no one bothered to address their 1200+ coal fire power plants.

China is the worlds largest carbon emissions emitter TODAY, historically the US has emitted over 20% of it making it the top contributor. The emissions china puts out today aren’t warming the climate as much as the gas USA put out over 200+ years has. Yeah china needs to cut emissions but it isn’t the only (or even biggest) reason it’s getting hot here. Also didn’t USA move like all of its manufacturing over there? Easy to export emissions then blame the import country lol.
FFS please stop comparing student loan forgiveness to PPP loan forgiveness. Regardless of your opinion on student loan forgiveness, it's intellectually vaccuous to compare it to the PPP program. PPP loan forgiveness was not about "relief" -- these were loans in name only, taken out with the in-advance knowledge they were to be forgiven. It was basically a grant program borrowing the accounting/legal structure of a loan program.
This program is supposed to help out someone with student loan debt. That's why someone with no student loan debt doesn't get helped by this program. Not every single government program is for every single person in the country. I don't qualify for food stamps or reduced internet prices. I don't complain about that because I understand that not every government program is for every person. And that's okay.

You are confusing failing with necessary, Amazon is too big to fail, it does not make it necessary, you could use other sites or go back to the local stores, but the corruption and power abuse by Amazon prevents it from failing, the same applies to FIFA.
It is too big to fail, most big names are attached to it in one way or another, you need the leagues to attract the people, the people bring money, money goes back to FIFA, it is a perfect corrupt circle of garbage.

If you're trying to argue it from a human rights angle then it's still wrong as Russia hosted it in 2018 which is far worse than Qatar ever will be.

Women's rights in Qatar are almost non-existent in Qatar too, comparatively Russia while slightly worse as most of the West their women are reasonably free and equal.

Russia is terrible but to say 'far worse' than Qatar is bit of a stretch, at least in terms of human rights. In Qatar they don't even have the pretence of democracy like in Russia(they are a damn absolute monarchy). As bad as LGBT stuff is in Russia, in Qatar homosexuality is illegal entirely.

You know because while it isn't illegal for gay people to exist in Russia, it is in Qatar... See how that\s worse ?

That was one of the biggest Fifa scandals up until Qatar.... Russia had recently annexed Crimea.. Russia was discriminating LGBT, but still not as much as Qatar where Homosexuals get either prison or death sentences. Nevertheless :
When drugs can be used for profit due to scarcity and illegality, nobody is safe. There are 2 solutions, legalization and government production of all drugs which removes incentive for any cartel by killing profitability, or extreme and anonymous violence designed to eliminate them, and the option to implicate rival cartel against each other. But neither will happen, drugs are part of the justification for the police state, without drugs, the only reason for crime is the poverty capitalism creates by exploitation.
But we were already on the topic of cartels… besides, as I’ve now learned, drug trafficking is a big part of the corruption there anyways. Maybe not in this case, but still.

I mean if you look at the casualties on both sides of the Mexican drug war it certainly seems like they aren’t in bed together like what’s being implied. Cartels have been a huge problem all over South America for decades, it’s not like it’s just Mexico. I don’t know, I mean I’m the type of guy to be inclined to believe that 9/11 and JFK were conspiracies, I certainly don’t think it’s natural for any government to really care about its citizens, but still these cartels have held so much power for so long, it seems like it would be hard to deal with. I don’t really know shit though.

I didn’t read the article until now, I retract my statements. Still though as a layman I think the only clear solution to all of this Mexico nonsense lies in the actions of the US who enables the drug trade in the first place. There’s only a couple clear ways to do to cut them off, legalizing all drugs or strenhening the border. Pick your poison, because this problem ain’t going nowhere.
It also speeds up the permitting process for renewable projects and grid enhancements (needed for more renewables).
In addition, and this is the single most important point -- it'll accelerate the development of zero carbon energy projects by largely fast tracking them through the approval process. It's terrible (and this is a self own on behalf of progressives when they decided to ally themselves with fossil fuel saboteurs looking to kneecap nuclear energy) that our energy projects take 6 years of review before anything can even start construction.

If the 369B for clean energy projects passed in the IRA are going to do anything in a meaningful timeframe, Manchin's deal needs to pass. We can't allow for zero carbon energy projects to stall out in regulatory limbo for 6 years before even a single shovel hits the ground.

Like it or not, we will still be dependent on fossil fuels for a while, but a gas pipeline isn't as bad as coal or oil. Even if we stopped all fossil fuels now, energy needs of the world are too high. Small steps are better than no steps.

Energy infrastructure isn't capable of providing the energy needs with renewables alone yet. Plus, cars and trucks are still manufactured to use petrol and getting everyone to be able to swap to electric cars will take decades. Battery tech is still not quite there yet, plus cost is prohibitive for many who can only afford older cars.

Electricity generation, buses, trains, planes, and yes cars do count because they are vital to the economy, be they trucks carrying loads cross country or cars people need to use to get to work/everyday tasks because there is no viable form of public transportation in their areas.
The basics: ‘sex’ is your biological features of penis, vagina, etc and determined by genetics of XX for female and XY for male. Generally male and female, but genetics are weird and you can have genes move around and get intersex people who have various combinations of sex organs.
We have bimodal sexes (mostly male or female with some variation due to genetic anomalies), this is important for sexual reproductive.
We have bimodal sexes (mostly male or female with some variation due to genetic anomalies), this is important for sexual reproductive.
Intersex has to do with chromosomes and the genitalia and other sexual dimorphism features that develop after birth. Intersex is not a gender identity it is a biologic sexual assignment. In rare cases, a person with XY chromosomes develops as a female because a male determining factor gene was incorrectly copied (not copied at all) onto the Y chromosome during crossover at fertilization. This happens Vice versa too where an XX people as well, where the Y determine allele gets incorrectly copied onto the X chromosome.

It’s not really a separate sex so much as a genetic coding error. If it was a separate, third sex there would be some reproductive or evolutionarily adaptive value to it, but that’s not the case. Everything is some combo of X and/or Y, but 99% of the time it conforms to the binary.

Because the straight between Honshu and Hokkaido is the only direction they can fire a missile long distance without the missile flying over land, especially over South Korea, China, or Russia.
With all the military material they are sending to Russia and the constant missle launches, my hope is that North Korea will actually have no weapons to fight with if they decide to invade South Korea.

North Korea most likely put out some form of advance notice of this test, specifically so it did not result in a response that involved an Ohio-class submarine opening missile tubes.

I seriously doubt that it was carrying a nuclear warhead. ICBM testing is one thing. ICBM testing that includes nuclear warheads, falling near other countries, is a recipe for escalation that North Korea wants no part of.

Errr, they have nuclear warheads, and now they’re demonstrating that they have ICBM capabilities. What they’re working on now is combining the two: mounting those warheads onto the right missiles. They are way beyond firecrackers.

Who provides the tech? We all do. They buy through all sorts of shell companies. For example, Iran was using Siemens controllers for their centrifuges which is how we targeted them with Stuxnet. So basically they are importing things illegally via the black market.

Nuclear weapons are a defence for the Kim regime. It’s a 100% guaranteed protection from invasion or any attempts to overthrow them. Basically it’s an insurance policy. That’s what I said a few posts ago when I said they’ll become untouchable.
SCOTUS justices should never be allowed to receive gifts from people or groups that have a vested interest in their rulings, regardless of whether the justices disclose it. Although federal employees are not justices, federal employees are not allowed to receive any gifts from people or groups that could affect their decisions regarding federal contracts. There is no reason that this rule should not also apply to SCOTUS justices, and the potential impact of any biased rulings can be far more consequential.

The Code of Conduct for United States Judges (those ethics standards you're referring to) is merely advisory. It has no enforcement mechanism, and is not binding to be used as the basis for civil or criminal action; so at the end of the day the fact that it doesn't apply to Supreme Court justices is entirely meaningless. It's basically just a worthless piece of paper even for the judges it does apply to.
I don’t think she was always a Republican in D clothing. Keith Olbermann - whose podcast I follow - has talked about her several times, how close they were, and during that time, he describes her as rather farther left than him. This would have been through at least fall of 2010 - it was her outreach on behalf of 2 AZ Representatives who needed help paying for security after death threats that got him suspended from MSNBC.
So she was likely still actually liberal as of 10 years ago, as she voted pretty hard left in the House, probably getting bought out in the run-up to her running for Senate in 2018.

So, since this proves that anyone can get elected as a Republican, regardless of background, what's to stop someone on the far left from running as a Republican and then siding with Democrats on all issues after getting in?

It's too bad bc the next AZ senate race will be Ruban Giallego (who got his ass handed to him when he ran for governor 2 years ago) vs Kari lake (super MAGA). Ruban called for open borders. You can't say stuff like that and win a general election in Arizona. He might have learned that while running for gov, but it's all on tape. Independents don't like him and they decide the election.

Excellent news. The only other thing I wish they would add is a limitation on Chinese investment in the US real-estate market too. If you don't live in the country or don't have dual citizenship you shouldn't be able to buy up property.

I've never had a corporate landlord after being forced to fix or replace an appliance then attempt to illegally bill me for the repair or replacement. I've never had a corporate landlord illegally put 8 migrant workers in the 1br suite next to mine. I've never had a corporate landlord attempt to prevent me from inviting friends to visit me. I've never had a corporate landlord attempt to illegally increase my rent higher than the law allows.
Renting any should become landlord territory, in a legal view. They should be treated as a business.
ugh, you couldn't be more wrong. Lukashenko has been overpromising Putin and underdelivering for 20 years. French media refers to him as the most shrewd politician in east europe for a good reason. What's with Redditors thinking Lukashenko is some kind of idiot when he's Europe's longest-serving ruler, before Putin was in power.
I also have doubts about Lukashenko currently wanting any of this in fear of losing power or his life, now that oligarchs have been falling out of windows lately. His own personal state keeps a nice buffer between him and any loose windows.

At a quick search I found a Belarussian poll from 1999 in which roughly 35% of belarusians opposed a union state while 47% supported it.

And I believe that the same unpopularity of the current regime along with belarusian nationalism will prevent any moves towards a union state.

The idea kinda soured with Putin's rise to power, but the treaty's still around and Putin's been using it and the increasingly unstable situation in Belarus to leverage Lukashenko into signing away more and more sovereignty to Russia.

The negotiations started and agreements were signed in preparation for a Union State between Russia and Belarus in the 1990s, well before Putin came to power.

tl;dr: Back in the 90s Russia and Belarus tentatively agreed to a long-term goal of unification. At this point Belarus was actually in a better position economically than Russia and Lukashenko figured he stood to eventually become leader of this theoretical post-Soviet union.
If you could prove that it's a clear and present danger, you could make the argument that it's too harmful to be permitted. One can't prove that, because it's not true, but Republicans are no longer even pretending to participate in good faith governance.
The average Republican voter has been completely immersed in Murdoch propaganda for over 20 years now and many of them have moved on to more insidious outlets. Their critical thinking skills have been, to put it mildly, blunted. This doesn't mean they're not culpable for their shitty voting choices, but it does mean that society as a whole needs to do something about virulent propaganda.

Of course they would still preach it just like they preach that dems are really the party trying to disenfranchise black voters, but in the case of guns, they're at least partly right.

I am almost at the point of willing to believe that gun control is a Republican plot to retain power by scaring their base. I’ve said it for years and will continue to say it until something changes: if dems kept every single policy position but stopped with the gun control and actually embraced the 2nd amendment, they would probably never lose another national election, and could actually enact all of the other great stuff they want with little trouble. Legalize weed too, and their dominance would be assured. But nooooo.

No. Not even then. Reagan is the one that passed most of the gun laws in California when black people started to arm themselves for protection.
In the 90s they were really planting all their seeds for a lot of this shit. Gotta sneak Jesus in everywhere you possibly can. Science class? "Teach both sides!" History/Civics? "What about all the Christian member of/parts to the Founding Fathers/the US?".
That's the thing. I don't expect The Church writ large to condemn this nonsense because the majority subscribe to it. (And so I understand the cynicism of most commentators here) But there are small congregations and individuals who can and must speak out against it immediately. And I hope that the cynics will give them a bit of credit if/when they do because that minority of sane, Christ-following Christians are much-needed allies against this brand of fascism wrapping itself in the trappings of Christianity.

Any Christian that considers themselves Christian nationalist, or any other flavor of theocrat, should picture that happening to books of the Bible that don't fit the needs of the state at any given time, and remember that's what Christian nationalism looks like in the long run.

I'm Gnostic, so other Christians disown me, and my whole religion is centered around opposition to religious dogma, all the way up to and including our views of the creator himself, so I don't know if I really count... but I denounce Christian nationalism and all forms of nationalism in the strongest terms.

I am a Christian and I denounce nationalism and any other form of hatred against other humans. I fight this fight with love every day and on Sunday at church. There are many in my church that support trump as if it is in line with their Christian belief, that you have to support him. It is extremely odd at best and more likely very dangerous at worst. I am making progress on some though, and helping them to see the error in their ways. It might just be my experience, but I find empathy and focus on forgiveness and restoration is the best way to get their heads out of their ass.

That all said, there are more than just a few that feel the same way I do at my church. I felt I was the only one at first and it made me feel like an enemy at my own church and treat them that way until I took the time to really dig deep and be vulnerable about the issues with trump/maga stuff. It’s hard to see past the crazy beliefs of maga and see the human behind those beliefs, but it is necessary to restore them.

It's a great joke because it absolutely is what happened -- the money he made from this fraud bankrolled both of his governorships and his Senate campaign. He never admitted fault for the fraud even though he was the CEO when it happened, the company took all of the blame, therefore nobody went to jail, and Scott kept all of the proceeds he "earned" while the fraud was being committed. He then has had three successive campaigns where he won by less than 1%. The guy stole federal money, barely won thrice, and now he's pulling up the ladder (Medicare and Social Security cuts) because he believes the federal government is misappropriating money. Isn't that just classic?
I'm a German and my strong gut instincts tell me that these are only stalling tactic and Scholz ultimately will say 'No'. Maybe Scholz tries to stall the process only until our new secretary of defense has taken his oath and afterwards Scholz will blame him for saying 'No'. Or maybe he thinks the war will stop soon or any other nonsense, I don't know. I really hate this rat on the throne!
Yeah, they may be a good alternative for Ukraine concerning the tank-question, but they surely are not a good option for Germany.

Poland sent Ukraine tanks over 6 months ago, and Germany said it wouldn't because it didn't want to escalate things or upset Russia. Germany was asked then, and said no -- you see how what you are saying isn't correct?

it wasn't otherwise we would have produced tanks 24/7 since last february. I absolutly hate how we treat our bundeswehr and our nato partners by letting it all rot away. this is all so dishonest and I bet there comes a day when it will cost us.
There have been protests against the invasion when it started but were shut down and there were protests against the mobilization but they got shut down too so the only resort for Russians is to flee the country their home which is really difficult as some neighboring countries won’t allow them to and civilians are saying they aren’t welcome I feel so horrible for people of both Ukraine and Russia who pay the price of what one person is doing.
Also there’s a new wave a protests in Russia from angry and distraught families who are upset that they were forced into war for nothing so yes protests are happening.

You would think with all the troops dying and coming home injured, and these women seeing what is happening first hand, it would start to change what Russians think about this war. I would think at some point they would come to the realization that Russia is at fault. From being in the US, I do realize that cultish behavior and gaslighting people can be hard to overcome.

Someone over there is going to have to take out Putin, or it won't end. It's going to have to be military. It will be labeled a massive heart attack. Closed casket.
The very well paid software dev money in the UK is in Finance, especially as a Freelancer (aka a Contractor) or even better a Quant (though that is more Maths than software dev and requires a hard science or Mathematics Degree or better).
However the path to that in the UK is near non-existent - how are young people entering the profession supposed to make their career up to the more senior levels were the good pay is, when the junior and mid-level work is either outsourced to places like India or doesn't pay enough to afford a place to live near were the work is?!

That’s where I’ve been looking! I work in health care, and the NHS seems better there. The recent nursing pay situation kind of has me reconsidering but we will see how it goes.

Crazy because I’m in the US and looking to move to the UK. My salary would be about half but the chances of armed revolution are pretty low in the UK.

Chances of an armed revolution in the US is pretty low too. Most people just want to go to work and go home.
20%-25% is where you start possible change in social convention. That is to say, it's enough to get the majority to move to "we're ok with this.".

Idaho is 92% white. While Montana is 88% white. They don't need to do anybring about diversity in their state, because there is pretty much no one but white people' living there. And I bet the population of LBGTQ is very low as well.

Not in the slightest. The only constitutional freedom they’ve ever championed is gun ownership. Aside from that, they’ve as of late tried to paint themselves as pro free speech but that’s very deceptive. They don’t like when people experience consequences from saying things many others find offensive(aka cancel culture), but they are all for using the power of government to limit or block the exercise of speech in the first place. This library is a prime example.
I used to work for a Library system. Before I worked there, I was told of the dark days when the "Crazies" were up in arms about a local newspaper we carried and had available called the Blade, which was aimed at the Gay community. It had ads for hookups in the back. They showed up to Library meetings, picketed a few Libraries, made a spectacle for about a year.

In the end, they lost steam and burned out, stopped doing what they were doing. I see now, they are back. Its cyclical. These people get bent out of shape over anything gay and think its Satan taking over. Ride it out, they'll lose steam.
Well, it's a mess specifically because the Serbs tried to butcher everyone to create an ethnostate and now refuse to admit that was ever the case and have tried to rewrite history as to make themselves out to be a victim because they were stopped. Serbs in Kosovo don't want to secede from Kosovo, they want it to not exist at all.
Frankly, it's amazing almost every issue in the Balkans involves Serbia. Serbia and Kosovo, Serbia and Albania, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina... Almost like the issue in the Balkans is near enough 100% due to the mentality of Serbia... If Serbs as a collective could simply accept the existence of others in the Balkans (I know, asking a lot here), that would pretty much solve everything there...

Or they could just go live in Serbia if they love that system so much, instead of constantly trying to undermine the transition to an independent country.

Absolutely agree. It's messy and not straightforward, but at this point both the Serb minority and Albanian majority need to just go with it and integrate together.

An independent and mixed Kosovo with its own national identity outside of Albanian/Serb is what I think everyone should hope for. It's an opportunity to bridge the peace and live together as a new nation. Any Albanians or Serbs that cling to their old national identities should indeed just go live in said nations.

The Serbs would argue the ethnic Albanians should just go live in Albania. See how that won’t get anyone anywhere?
Exactly. It behooves Russia to also know he’s going to be there because one missile too close and we’re all in for a mess. And all Russia can do is sit there and basically go “okay we won’t attack while he’s there.” And it plays great for Ukraine and allies.
Putin's remaining hope is that the world tires of the war and loses it's taste for supporting Ukraine. This is typically not an unreasonable hope. Countries often lose interest as these conflicts drag on.

By showing up and reinforcing the support of the U.S. Biden sends the message that this isn't one of those times. And it strenhens the resolve of the other countries who have been supporting Ukraine. Putin surely isn't happy today.

Putin has had a few staged photo ops of him standing with some troops. However, people have noticed that some of the same "soldiers" are in different shots taken at different times.

Yes, but he also knows those pictures make him look like a paranoid weakling. So he occasionally stages some artificial photo op to trick his people into thinking he's not hiding in a fortress.
Mills, who was endorsed by former president Donald Trump, could not be more different. He is among several new House members who denies that President Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election. A veteran, Mills also bragged in his campaign that he “sold tear gas used on Black Lives Matter protesters.”.
“Per the letter, the grenades are inert, and were cleared through all security metrics,” Mills spokesman Juan Ayala said in an email. “I just wish they tagged our official account.”.

Mills won election to represent Florida’s 7th Congressional District in November, flipping the seat that was formerly held by Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), a member of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.

Why be mad about it ? Taking money out of crooks pockets to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction sounds good to me. (It would be especially ironic and savory if the crook in question turns out to be a Russian oligarch).
No thanks, no need to just act like Z is the only person in Ukraine deserving thanks and create new oligarchs to worship.

Hmm. Let's say 15% of the build cost as total annual operating expenses, so $15m. At 15 passengers, and let's say operating at an average 50% capacity... and assuming you'd like some actual net earnings to fund Ukraine's recovery... call it a ticket price of $7k per person per day?

That would net you $5m per year. Doesn't seem like much... but I guess if you service the ship exclusively at Ukraine's Black Sea ports and staff it exclusively with Ukrainians, then a lot of your annual costs are actually going to be plowed back into Ukraine's economy. So you could count that as an extra win.
Drive to your nearest inner city and ask yourself why Biden chooses to send $37 billion to Ukraine instead of fix the city you’re driving through. Ask yourself how long has that city looked that way. Ask yourself what $37 billion could do for that city. It’s mind-boggling that none of you see how bad the Democrats manipulate you for a vote and do nothing for you.
Wild to think without gerrymandering, republicans would have lost the house…they cheated and even then they barely won. It’s sad to see everybody getting mad at dems for losing the house but in reality, republicans should never have control of it in the first place….

But at the end of the day, the Republican majority will be so small that it’s going to be essentially irrelevant. The GOP can’t agree on anything, it’s just going to be 2 years of chaos and inactivity in the House.

Two.. Russia gave a stupid reason to invade its neighbor.. Russia doesn't own the people who speak russian.
And dont talk to me about the pathetic attempt at russian protests. In a country of 140M about 100k (and i am being generous with the number) ppl in total protested in March for a couple of days (then there were no protests). Of all those people about 4.3k were detained but not arrested. They faced fines and some kind of community service. The only people jailed for 3 to 5 years are a handful of bloggers/youtubers/artists that spread some form of antiwar content online. That is a fraction of a percent of the people wjo protested. A FRACTION OF A PERCENT. That is pathetic. Allow me to reiterate, they protested for a few days with basically no form or persecution weighing on them and then stopped.

No it doesn't take courage to protest 2x and then forget about it. And yes I have protested in my country.

But have you protested? Thats my question. Would you protest knowing you be in jail for 5 years? And please don’t take credits away from those who protested in Russia. It takes good courage to do it.

The Republican party would merely look like they heeled behind another elitist white collar criminal politician instead of an anti-democratic and existentially dangerous one. While still providing the break from Trump that this election may have shown they needed.

Without looking at which judges voted which way, I'm guessing the Republican controlled Supreme court is doing this to sink Trump's chances of getting the party nomination.

This is just the supreme court throwing a bone at liberals before they give Republicans the power to legally overthrow the voters. Then they can point to this ruling and say "see, we are impartial.".
So… blaming the Jews for everything is fine (and gets you a Republican “free speech” endorsement??) but saying you like Hitler is too far? Do I have all of this in the right order?
I guess what I was trying to highlight was Republicans saying “we didn’t care about this guy before but now we stand by his right to say Jews are running a global conspiracy and ruining his life” and then backtracking when he went from 99% to 100% on the antisemitism.

I'm saying for the time being, right wing figures like Tucker Carlson prefer to engage in dog whistles where they can feign ignorance about their bigotry if confronted, as opposed to just saying "I hate Jews" or yelling the N word. Tucker Carlson took the interview with Kanye and edited out the stuff where he thought Kanye went too far, or said things that wouldn't support Carlson's narrative, and used that cut down version to push his own views, rather than just presenting Kanye as he really is.

Yep. Tucker Carlson even out the most egregious antisemitism from his two hour interview with Kanye in October (along with other crazy statements, and even Kanye just saying he was vaccinated) to make him more palatable to his right wing audience. The people on the right know full well how crazy and offensive he is, but they see him as a fig leaf to hide their racism behind simply because he's Black. It's the same thing they're doing with Herschel Walker.

Yep. People need to remember that Hitler was inspired by American treatment of Black people and Jim Crow laws as a blueprint for what he did with respect to Jews in Europe before the Holocaust truly began in the 1940s.

Check out the applause that Dave Chappelle was getting on SNL last month for his to Kanye and Kyrie on how to "properly" engage in antisemitism. It's extremely mainstream nowadays.

Of course it's going mainstream. Antisemitism is never far behind fascism, although the fascists try to make it all a bit milder and more milquetoast... at first.

It is mainstream with Conservatives who are after all Christian white nationalist scum and fascists. So yes. Hate is on the rise in conservative America and the violent attacks against us will continue.
See. That wasn't so hard. Now, queue everyone telling me why this won't work by focusing on exceptions and outliers. These same people will also not mention a better strategy because that involves sticking their neck out.
Stop getting mad at people coming up with real solutions to real problems. If the Iranians current strategy is working, then time will prove me wrong. If it's not, then maybe you should think about what could be done differently instead of advocating for doing nothing.

please do enlighten us about your "real solutions" that work. in fact the the Iranian people just want you to be the leader since you just know so much about their country.

They “claim” (and you can never trust what the Iranian state media says. They still claim Mahsa Jina Amini died of a heart attack at age 22) he was blocking a street to protect protestors and he injured a guard.
Hate to disappoint folks, but using a robot to deliver deadly force has been an option for law enforcement, nationwide, for years now.
The San Francisco Police Department said it does not have pre-armed robots and has no plans to arm robots with guns. But the department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges “to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect” when lives are at stake, SFPD spokesperson Allison Maxie said in a statement.

Putting an explosive charge on a robot and blowing up the barricaded Dallas subject was the only way to kill him without putting additional police in extreme danger, given the unique and exigent circumstances of that particular case.
Putting an explosive charge on a robot and blowing up the barricaded Dallas subject was the only way to kill him without putting additional police in extreme danger, given the unique and exigent circumstances of that particular case.
The precedent for a robot to to deliver deadly force was created in 2016 with the Dallas shooter, who had killed 5 cops, and barricaded himself in a parking garage where he could not be safely approached by police or reached with an armored vehicle. He was on the phone with negotiators saying "come and get me, so I can kill more of you".
You do know that in order to detonate a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb and create the temperatures and pressures necessary for fusion you have to build it inside of a fission bomb with traditional radioactive material like plutonium or uranium right? Hydrogen bombs still have radiation, though I’ll be honest I don’t know the difference in radiation levels between a straight up fission bomb or a fusion bomb detonated by fission.
Modern hydrogen bombs don't irradiate, they just vaporize and create shock waves. If that were to happen, I'd rather be in the center than be a survivor.

Air allows the energy to spread quickly. The closer to the ground the more you are wasting energy in pushing all that excess matter, and all the nasty isotopes of uranium, cesium, thorium, iodine, etc.

Modern hydrogen bombs detonate a half a mile or so above ground level. It creates way less radioactive isotopes than the older cold war bombs. They are typically three stage, which uses fusion triggers to create fission, hence higher yield of energy given the amount of fuel source.
I'm not too sure about that. I remember in the opening days of the war when the Ukrainians realized that Russian tanks were coming to kill them all. All the men went away to war, then I saw a video of local musicians that had gathered in the park to entertain a large crowd of women, children, and the elderly, who were all preparing food and singing songs as they all worked together to prepare thousands of Molotov cocktails for their unwelcome guests. It was then that I knew that Ukraine could never be defeated.
Russia cant defeat the WEST on the battlefield. Just dont forget who kept you alive Zelenskyy. Without that massive amount of support Ukraine would be Putins puppet state by now.

If Russia takes all of Ukraine. The next one would be a nato county and I am willing to see what happens. You can’t say the west didn’t do some provoking. Well here we are. Nato and the west broke a lot of agreements made and the current Russia is not the old USSR. Russia tried to join NATO a few times and they wouldn’t let them. Christianity is exploding in Russia and the west is mad they overthrew their control gained during the Bolshevik Revolution. Also, I don’t think there is any government worth fighting for on the planet so yea. I mean Putin is so bad they are making money hand over fist, Have a strong currency, and have Christian values. They are so terrible. My point is ever country has done really bad things and justified it. I don’t think Russia is the demon everyone makes them out to. Let’s talk. Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan. I guess China can’t do any wrong. A US Russia Alliance would basically control the world and support Christian values. That’s what I would do. Peace through strenh.

Right, unfortunately life isn’t fair. I don’t want to give any more arms or money to Ukraine. I don’t want to get nuked because of Ukraine. Ukraine pretty much started it by committing crimes against Russian speaking people. It’s messy both sides are at fault. Why would Russia let Ukraine on its border join NATO. That is a violation on the Minsk agreement by the west and one of Russias red lines. Hence the situation we are in. Ukraine will be losing land it’s just a matter of how much will be left.

And the UK and US bombed the pipelines going to Germany. I don’t support that either. The US and Nato bombed Iraq to the dark ages and killed millions of civilians. What is so special about Ukraine? Why do they have to have every inch back. I don’t support Russia but it’s the civilians that suffer. I mean the Current Ukraine govern is and has been very corrupt. My point is both sides won’t get everything they want but it needs to stop.

If you look at it Ukraine is not ready for winter combat. Russia has taken the gloves off when Ukraine hit the bridge. That was civilian infrastructure. I am not taking sides. I would like both of them to sit down and hash it out to end the war. Russia is probably the better equipped for military action in the winter. All civilians lose in war. We should had our politicians weapons and tell them to go fight it out.
There’s no excuse for them other than the dems are outnumbered at the polls. I live in Ohio and the state of politics here is simply awful. But there’s still plenty of dems and non-idiot voters in Ohio. Admittedly, there also a ton of idiot democrats that didn’t show up to vote this past election. If those people freaking showed up, we might not have DeWine or Vance.
Can we please not paint all “these people” with the same brush? A friendly reminder that Ohio is gerrymandered to hell and there’s many democrats in this region too.

That part of Ohio is by Youngstown, it was big time democrat country for as long as I can remember, until recently. You’re not finding people opposed to infrastructure out there. Weak.

I realize that the person I’m responding to is being a jerk. He is blaming the people of east palestine for this, by assuming they vote this way or that. When really it’s union country.

Wtf are you talking about? There is no evidence this has anything to do with an infrastructure problem. It’s an Ohio town that has a railroad going through it, there’s towns like this all over the USA.
This is an attempt to frogmarch public schoolchildren into Christianity and taxpayer money into the hands of private donors who'll donate generously to the Republicans.
Don't kid yourself. In their view, a child that doesn't believe in Jesus is as unwanted and unwelcomed as a trans child or a gay child. So is the kid who is gutsy enough to speak up for those kids. The kids that don't conform would kicked from school to school and it would be part of their permanent record that they're "troublemakers.".

Yes. That's really it. those meet at the flag pole things were scary to me, growing up in the Bible Belt. Everyone knew who wasn't there, and they tried to make those kids' lives hell for it. It's scary Christian nationalist shit.

They'll be stripping the public schools of all the money eventually, and the public school kids will be left out of their Christian nationalist schools.

Once public schools are destroyed, they'll end vouchers and charters, leaving only expensive private schools most of the public won't be able to afford, and the public will just be SOL. In the meantime, it's a huge transfer of wealth from the public into private hands, and eventually, education will only go to the most privileged.
It's hilarious when they call her just a dumb bartender. Like.. she graduated cum laude from Boston University with a double major in economics and international relations. But sure, go off. Totally dumb.
They hate her bc she's a strong, beautiful, capable woman and they would absolutely do her but she would never touch them 🤣.

AOC’s representation in the right wing media however is a sexist, racist distortion of someone who is actually competent. They’re afraid of her because of that competency. She’s progressive and popular and there isn’t one Republican in the House who can stand against her rhetorically. And I’m not talking about the average Fox News viewer. I’m talking about the establishment. They know she’s a threat to them so they have to smear her.

All this “they’re afraid of her” nonsense is just tough talk. If she had appeal to centrists, she would have appeal to centrists.
It has been available for men also for a time, but there was a masculine taboo about using it for a whils,so a very good look when our defence minister takes the leave also!
Also, another quirk here is that he must formally resign as defense minister, but not as MP, as the law doesn´t recognize ministerial leave as such. He will be reappointed to the position by his party, although this is by convention and not required.

Minister Kaikkonen is using his maximum allowed paternity leave, as his child was born before september 2022.
Minister Kaikkonen is using his maximum allowed paternity leave, as his child was born before september 2022.
For anyone wondering, fathers in finland are for children born before september 2022, entitled to 54 days of paid paternity leave, with maximum of 18 days at the same time as the mother. Mothers were entitled to 105 days of maternity leave, which could start 30 days before the due date. This was followed by 154 days of care leave, which could be used by either father or mother, to be used before the child is 2.

Starting for children born from September 2022 onwards, there is 30 days of pregnancy leave, followed by paid parenting leave for both parents of 160 days. Either parent can shift 63 of those days to the other parent.

Also also, during this parliament, our finance minister, education minister, environment minister and basic services minister have all used maximum amount of paid leave allowed, but as they are women it didnt make the news. (Why yes, this government is lead by women under 40, why do you ask?).

Yes. I’m an expecting first-time-mother, and this is all I will be offered after birthing my baby. 12 weeks unpaid leave “job security” under FMLA. Came here to add that many people don’t take all 12 weeks because we simply can’t afford it.
True. A horrible political decision. They should have done their own search of documents, turned them over and then let the DOJ investigate.
Because, per the article, the Biden team halted the initial search upon finding the documents and requested the DOJ help in completing the search. True it’s embarrassing however the “how it happened” is pretty clear in the article. There were documents, a few were found, bidens team involved professionals to help search for the rest, the media reports each instance separately to make for a better story. People can and should take from that as they will.

Don’t disagree. It’s been commented everywhere that on the hill if you want anyone to read anything it has to be marked classified otherwise no one has time for it. I suspect there is rampant issues with this in quite a few people in government. But to your point the system needs to be improved.

I’d be ok with that. Course… if we DO do that seems reasonable to do a search of all politicians residences to make sure no one running has any documents either though.

I think it’s reasonable to ask if this isn’t a little to convenient finding the classified documents. I suspect that Garland could be asking the same questions. Just speculating.
"I've met with scientists, some of the top people in the world, that tell me that we have extraterrestrial craft in our airspace on a regular basis,” Burchett added.".

Some certainly are. But these reports are apparently in areas that would not be likely test areas for experimental aircraft. Out in the ocean for instance. Not a good place to test a prototype if something goes wrong.

Skimmed it. That article presupposes as its axiom that these phenomenon are in fact physical crafts and thus calculate the forces and accelerations necessary to explain the observed path of these "objects". Its a flawed assumption.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. New physics is an extraordinary claim. We have nothing approaching extraordinary evidence to support such a claim.

That's powerful evidence that these craft are not extraterrestrial. We must acknowledge that, given the local laws of physics, anything that is possible is possible independent of who's creating it (provided they have the requisite knowledge to make it), that we have no evidence of technologically superior civilizations that would have the knowledge where we don't, and that these craft are appearing here, where the only civilization we have any evidence of is us.

If the laws of physics allow one civilization to gain that knowledge and manufacture X, and the laws are invariant across the universe, then the laws of physics do not prevent any particular civilization from manufacturing X.

Non Muslims aren’t allowed to pray on the Temple Mount. The Israeli police will kick you out if you do anything resembling prayer to say nothing of the Waqf.
Israeli police do so because the Wakf demands it. It's part of the agreement Israel has with Jordan to prevent the Palestinians from rioting. The threat of Palestinian riots are the reason we have this situation. Israel is essentially caving to fascists and religious fundamentalists due to the threat of violence. Nobody should cave to those lunatics. That's appeasement and it only makes things worse.

The fight against bigotry and anti-Semitism is political, so there is nothing wrong with making a political statement in this case. More people should be making political statements against the bigotry and apartheid policies being implemented by Arab nations.
There was no way the Democrats would have won no matter who they nominated. No one was beating DeSantis. And the national party knew that. That's why they didn't give any money to Florida governor race. The national party abandoned Florida.
But Florida is also the state that may not be a swing state anymore. It's been trending to the right since 2010. And it took a big step right in this election. It's going to be quite some time before the Democrats win a state-wide race again in Florida. Losing the Hispanic vote by 57%? Yeah, Democrats in Florida are toast until that statistic changes.

The problem is that "Florida voters" means two different things. In the premise, it refers only to those Florida voters who lived in Judge Smith's jurisdiction. In the conclusion, she wants the reader to read it as all Florida voters; because why would it matter if a governor making a statewide appointment defied the electoral choices of a single district? Every governor necessarily makes decisions which many districts or municipalities would oppose if they got to vote on it, but that doesn't make for a pithy title and essay.

From what little I've read of this judge he seems abhorrent and there can absolutely be valid criticism of his appointment. My issue is with the idea that DeSantis is somehow defying the will of the people who voted for him by appointing the judge.The comment I responded to says:

DeSantis appointing that same judge to a state-wide position, objectively a much higher responsibility and higher level position, but then saying in not so many words "it's not the same as the jurisdiction of voters"...is pretty backwards logic. In what world do voters not have confidence in an official to perform a local-level job, but simultaneously that person would be adequate for a higher level state-wide position? It's terrible (or more likely biased) judgement on DeSantis' part to purposefully fail someone upwards simply because he has the power to do so.
Originally, yes, but not so much at this point. The post-war treaties have all been replaced with various mutual defense treaties with the US (among other nations). Japan could choose to build an offensive military at this point, but it would require changing their constitution.
Incidentally, the US actually WANTS the Japanese to amend their constitution to allow a standing army, and they have been lobbying them to do exactly that since 1948. The US sees Japan as a valuable ally and a more armed Japan would be seen as a strategic asset to the US, particularly with Russia and China posing such significant threats to the region.

With how poorly they executed the Ukrainian invasion, and Japan having America's backing (as well as potential help from South Korea), I see a chance that if Russia ttacks Japan, Japan will make Russia its "Special Region".

Or could have just been "Bring me plans for 5 different countries that we could take land from" and some schmuck had to get some generals together to make rudimentary battle plans for Finland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Japan, with hypothetical triggers that wouldn't make Russia look like an idiot.

Declaring war on a major country is stupid idea, but being able to plan a war against any country is probably a good exercice to learn/understand how your own military works, how a country is built (politics, logistics, energy countries and armies work and which weaknesses at every level need to be addressed.

I wouldn't be surprised if the most militaries or intelligence agencies had vague plans about everything you can think of - from helping a country suffering a country-wide disaster to their own allies turning against them like the US did post-WW2.

I suppose I'd rather they spent this much effort into plans to boost up their economy or prevent a pandemic but we often look wholly unprepared !
what's true is that Biden did way bigger progress in fighting unemployment in his first 2 years than Trump did in 4 and Obama did in 8.
If the question is whether there's inflation, and the overall economy is shit, there's no question, but it becomes more nuanced when you ask whether it'd be way worse without the actions the Biden admin has taken.

The fact that the midterms weren’t a referendum on Biden with inflation at historic highs is a sign of Biden’s meeting the moment, not of his inadequacy.

And if his actions were influential I think that would've been reflective in his approval-ratings. The midterms went on and we won in spite of him if anything, not really because of him in my view. Exit-polls show this that people voted on the issues even though they consciously did not approve of Biden's job. Now I personally think Biden did pretty well given the circumstances, but I also think most other average Presidents could've done the same... Good Presidents perhaps could've wielded the bully pulpit even more effectively.

Biden has been the most impressive and progressive president, and in my opinion, the best president we've had so far.

I agree generally with your framing - but the neutral enthusiasm for Biden is part of his genius in this moment. It’s why he beat Bernie. And trump. And held the senate.

Yes. Leave made a mistake by working secretly as paid assets of the Kremlin to undermine the UK. Remain made a mistake by not arresting them for literal treason. The EU made a mistake by not arresting them abroad and deporting them back home.

It's not the EUs fault and that was my argument. They do however make it possible to happen again. Imagine an almost limitless supply of cheap labour and if a worker is unhappy you're breaking the law, then they can be sacked immediately. No government is going to care about the locals if a company is making insane profits lol. I always wondered what the advantage was for the rich people who benefitted off cheap labour, but I imagine a lot of it was because they were power hungry parasites like Farage.

Also just checked, can't find proper statistics but more than 60% of people (that's the highest the map says) of the town voted leave. I am more than happy for anyone to give me good arguments I can make with the local people because I still work there often. My main one was if they didn't get cheap labour from Europe they'd just get it from somewhere else which was probably the most successful tactic.

It wasn't just the people in charge of leave that caused the Brexit issue. Near where I live, there's a town that has a big factory, and because of cheap labour from Eastern European countries the factory employed 1000s of them. There are like 12 people living in a small 2 bed house. The people who live in that town have seen a normal town suddenly overwhelmed by 10 times the population growth with no extra facilities, doctors clinics etc. I spoke to people there, and some of them didn't even know who Farage was, they just hated the fact that because of the EU, this factory could import insane amounts of workers on terrible wages and basically ruin their neighbourhood.

According to sources, Bannon owes “significant” sums of money to attorneys M. Evan Corcoran of Baltimore and Robert Costello of New York City. They—along with David Schoen of Montgomery, Alabama—spent months battling the Department of Justice in 2021 and 2022, and they represented him at a trial in Washinon, D.C., last summer when he was eventually convicted of contempt of Congress.

Steve Bannon—the nativist American media personality who’s backed by a Chinese billionaire—hasn’t paid the lawyers who spent years defending him against an onslaught of criminal charges, according to three sources who spoke exclusively to The Daily Beast.
I think there’s people in leadership positions, within world governments that also have this mentality. Which leads me to believe many of these warmonger keyboard warriors are probably paid shills or bots, echoing thoughts of these pundits.
I would be unsurprised if this actually was a Russian missile. Their low-tech equipment would allow this margin of error.. Although, there could be debris with a Russian flag and video footage seconds before blowing up, and I’d hope world leaders would still deny Russian origin. I’m not saying it is absolutely a Russian missile, just that, what has been stated is literally the only sane and reasonable answer.

It makes sense that Ukraine is using these missiles, considering Russia is technically Ukraines largesr international supplier of weapons, by capturing them.

It blew up on the ground, so it wasn't fragments. I believe it was fired, and either another missile took the russian one out, or equally as likely, it just missed. Another user on this comment thread said Ukranian made missiles self destruct if they miss, Russian made ones only blow up on impact, target or not.

The older patriot missiles are an example, they weren't meant to impact the target intact, rather they detonate into a cloud of fragments disabling aircraft.

This is why investigations matter, many air defense systems were designed primarily for anti aircraft so will detonate near incoming threats.

So it is possible these rockets were damaged and sent off course. Two together seems a bit odd, I would suspect electronic countermeasures, but my knowledge of Russian systems and Ukraine's systems besides the lent stingers is far too limited.

It could also be a fuck up, with so many new systems being rushed into service without direct support Ukraine is bound to make mistakes.
Russia was always painted as like the final boss of a video game. I'm in my thirties, so growing up in the immediate post-Cold War world, I always saw Russia framed as our utmost existential threat. And for valid reasons.
This makes a lot of sense, thanks for the well-thought-out reply! I hope that if Russia does split that there is a minimum of bloodshed and border disputes.

Out of curiosity, what parts of Russia do you think should be split into smaller nations, what would it achieve, and do you see any potential drawbacks to splitting Russia up?

So... this is a tough question because the long history of Russia has involved deliberate subjugation of groups and areas that have designs on independence. It's also involved deliberate prevention of any one area being self sufficient.

I would imagine there are numerous communities across the world where this kind of thing takes place. Not just religions of course but any strong tribalism that takes root. It can and does exist at varying levels throughout society and it is undesirable in all of them imo.

I dont know that it would even be a correct ruling. Being gay isnt different than being black. If you cant discriminate on one, you cant on the either regardless of your personal religious doctrine. Those things are interchangeable here.

Your freedom of religion means you get to be free of persecution and discrimination based on your religion. Gay people getting married doesnt infringe on anything. It does not mean you can discriminate because of your religion.

The man was fond of his booze, but the amount he was drinking daily is often exaggerated, not least by people who seek to "spend a day drinking like Churchill" and get the amounts wrong. By, for instance, drinking straight whisky instead of one of his watered-down highballs,, or enjoying the wrong size bottle of champagne with their meals.

Yes. That was the news and some expert opinions of the audio. Still it won't make it "true" since there was actually nothing visible etc. I ain't supporter of her party but we should stick to criticizing her politics instead of digging dirt to make her look bad. She definitely has now fucked up couple times but they have been blown bit out of proportions.
Trump isn’t the only one that needs to go. The Extreme Right currently has a stranglehold on the Republican Party. DeSantis which is supposedly his successor is just as unfit for office. When you transport immigrants from another state to Martha’s Vineyard as a pure political stunt or you retaliate against Disney just because they spoke out about your LGBT policies then you are unfit for office. These are just bit a few examples. If you think it’s just Trump, your poorly mistaken.
Trump has never been presidential. He's not off the rails now because he was never on them. He was mildly tempered by people in his administration who thought they could prop him up to be presidential, yet they all failed miserably.

The Trump moving forward is only going to be less trusting of the GOP, less trusting of those who understand politics, and more fly by the seat of his pants. Any control the GOP had over Trump is dwindling to the point of non-existence. Spite and anger are just going to be his wheelhouse from here forward.
this is a situation where the libs actually need to be owned though and letting congresspeople to continue to use “democracy” as a casino to “own the republicans” is much worse, actually.
Besides, democrats are not as petty as the republicans and actually have some ideological scruples— so a bill introduced by republicans is much more likely to pass anyway.

The republicans can actually be trusted to support a bill sponsored by a republican, and the democrats will look at the bill on its merits. Several of them may be willing eschew party lines and vote with the republicans, so really it made sense to table it until this session. Let the republicans waste their legislative time bickering over the details of it— they ought to do some of the work for once.

Well not really. In my high school students got sent home or otherwise punished for wearing shirts with alcohol products depicted, references to drugs, etc. Hell in my middle school they cracked down on kids wearing pajama pants (I've always thought that was ridiculous). Then of course there are the standard dress code rules about skirt lenhs etc. But yeah, historically schools do control what kids can wear.

Don't most PUBLIC schools have dress restrictions with respect to disruptive attire? Whether this T-shirt should be considered such is a judgment call, and I could see reasons to believe banning it would be, er, overkill.
One part of this is the decline of native plant species. Between expansion of suburban areas filled with lawns and introduced plant species, agricultural land, and introduced species escaping into the wild and crowding out natives, many insects are losing their food sources. The insects that eat those insects then also lose their food sources. Add in the careless use of pesticides and other air pollutants, and yeah..
Edit: everyone should plant an oak tree in their yard if you have the chance. They are immensely important keystone species that provides food and shelter for a wide variety of insects. Also going to plug “the nature of oaks” by Doug Tallamy.

Yes that’s true. Unfortunately it can be hard to find a wide variety of native species. If you’re in the Midwest, there is Prairie Nursery that ships plants. Also Prairie Moon nursery. You can always search for native nurseries in your area. I’m also lucky to have a farmer at our local farmers market who sells wildflower seeds that he collects from his property. And thankfully, the trend has been moving toward people wanting more native plants, and growers and nurseries are realizing the trends. I’d welcome others adding any native plant sources they know if.

Plant native plants in your garden. Specifically keystone species like Native oak trees. Remove a section of your lawn. which is a monoculture anyway. Dead zone for insects. Stop spraying pesticides, Add native pollinator plants! We all can make a difference. I live in an urban area with less than .2 of an acre. However, I have bees, butterflies ,birds flying around. Eating the seeds, berries, insects. My neighbors who only have a few non native foundation plants and who maintain a lawn. Have barely any life in there yards. Be proud of your area, and incorporate life. By planting native plant species. Even if all you have is a balcony. Add a few native plants in pots and see what happens. Like milkweed. The only host plant for the monarch butterfly.

Reading one of Doug Tallamy books will blow your mind. And make you realize just how important native plants truly are. You’ll start to see all the plants in your community that do not add to the local ecosystem.

It's a lot of fun, I even had a huge "size of my hand" paper wasp nest built into the crook of my rabbit fence. All of those insects are predatory as adults, and I had a hundred. There must have been plenty of food and no pesticides in my suburban neighborhood.

I mean, you've seen equal amounts of proof of both sides at this point. You've heard that he's released NSA files that show that the public is being spied upon, and nobody is debating that point. You've now heard that a majority of the millions of documents that he released are focused on military capabilities and operations and not just domestic espionage, and nobody has officially debated this point, either. Yet, because it puts him in a bad light, and despite the fact that we can both doubt that Snowden had personally read through the millions of documents that he has released, you immediately get defensive when you are told that he's not some paragon of light and that he released a bunch of data en masse rather than only releasing what was related.
So Edward Snowden leaks documents explicitly proving that the NSA and military have long documented histories of outright lying to the American public.

The Arizona GOP just emphasizes the fact that the GOP are a bunch of radical losers that are so extreme voters (the ones that matter) are no longer aligning with them.

I’ve lived in AZ for 40 years and this is my theory. I believe that AZ is not a purple state, but a red leaning state. I base this on the high Mormon & Hispanic populations here. Maricopa County is very suburban and somewhat diverse. It’s very hard to live here without having at least one POC or LGBTQ person in your neighborhood, school, or office. As such we have a polite suburban culture. You can have all of the bigoted feelings you want, but open, unapologetic bigotry is a no-go. Arizonans need the quiet part to stay quiet or else that nice black family my kid hangs out with are going to associate Me with bigotry. AZ’s culture calls for a John McCain type - shitty conservative policies, no open bigotry.

The fact that they were in a position where they realised they could commit suicide right there and then made more people commit suicide than if they didn't have an opportunity like that. So if we extrapolate that to this situation, more people might commit suicide, even though their condition is oftentimes treatable.

I would never vote for her because she has shown that she is willing to flip on a position and sell out her constituents if it benefits her personally. The next time it could involve first or second Amendment protections or an appointment of a judge. I wouldn’t trust that to her.
Since that time she has been heard walking back that decision by stating that she knows most people in the state who have that flag are just good decent people who only see the flag as a symbol of being Southern.

Here’s the point. I have no doubt that there isn’t a single person in this sub who has a problem with a removal of any Confederate flag, but setting aside anyone’s feelings on that subject for or against, it still shows that Niki Haley is just another politician who is willing to sell the influence of her office for personal gain.

Yeah, I think Haley is lining herself up for a 2024 run or trying to sap support away from Trump towards DeSantis to be DeSantis' VP. A DeSantis/Haley team could tout:
That's just the beginning ... it's important to report anything that references the Bible and its religious teachings. That means anyone who wears a cross is on the list. Or anyone who goes to a church because many Christian denominations have been repeatedly exposed as havens and providing protections for pedophile priests and ministers. And it's going to kind of suck for any town with a name like "Saint" or any community that exists in a "parish" (instead of a "county," which is the proper term used in the United States . ).

Like it is the most likely explanation. I would assume something like orders coming down from high "we have public pressure and spotlight on us, do not allow any unauthorized entities into airspace". Well military does job as ordered. Obviously the hobby balloon is not going to answer to hailing and most likely as hobby project they didn't spend the money to put a ADS-B beacon on it.

Also I think you haven't been paying attention if you think the balloons were discreet considering they were all spotted and shot down.

Assuming they are being deployed from a mothership or something within our atmosphere- how TF are they able to hide the mothership but not the balloons? The logic just does not make sense.
Age was the real discriminant here. White women under 45 were majority Democratic, over 45 is where it flips over to Republican. The latter group just ends up dominating the overall category because, surprise, older people are more likely to vote.
If anything I've gotten more liberal as I've gotten older and more successful, I don't believe in the old "If you're not a liberal when you're [young age] you have no heart, if you're not a conservative when you're [middle age] you have no brain" adage at all lol.

I read earlier that younger generations aren't Republican because, if you're under like thirty five, you've never seen the Republican party do absolutely anything positive for you.

I'm guessing the older white women that still voted against their interests just don't understand the link between the Republican party and the death of Roe?

It’s because white republican women are pick-mes deep down and they prove it every time they’re at the ballot box and vote against their womanhood for white male proximity.

Don't forget that brain dead lazy white women are are all for pro-choice but are too fucking lazy to go out and vote. They think bitching on twitter is the same thing as doing something to change.

It's like in 2016 when they were all like "Trump won?! How?1" and people asked if they voted and they go of course not.
You're not wrong, the anti labor laws and regulations that bought and paid for politicians have put in place over the last 30 or so years have decimated labor and worker rights while keeping the wages low enough that there isn't even hope of fighting back.
Blaming unions for not being appealing enough instead of the oligarchs who’ve devoted unlimited dark money to politicians to bust unions is kinda gross.

If a large union only facilitated collective bargaining, they’ll find themselves chipped away by the legislature, since the company they’re bargaining against has no such qualms paying off the state.

Dems literally should've passed 1 bill being forcing the corporation to accept the unions reasonable demands.

The second Republicans made it apparent they wouldn't support basically anything but the absolute bare minimum? They should've simply used republican talking points against them "this isnt an appropriate use of government power, especially to pass along a partisan line. it's between the union and corporation" or something along those lines.
Having reached center stage Trump attracted a host of enablers and deflectors who ran interference for him in the right wing sphere. Now his political aura is not so potent he is expected to just gracefully fade away. Not going to happen. He will not just go quietly. He will tarnish any Republican opponents who dare to try to elbow him off the stage. Kinda wish he was back on twitter to loudly toxify the whole right wing political process.
Hopefully anger toward the GOP will translate into the 2024 race. Hopefully democrats can do a good job show casing how batshit desantis’s policies and focus are.hopefully trumps infighting damages him enough. And hopefully Moore v Harper doesn’t automatically doom democracy by then anyway.

Yeah it’s a weird and horrifying set of circumstances to consider. DeSantis did well. But he really hasn’t done anything that differently from the rest of the GOP. He’s big on culture war bullshit he literally signed don’t say gay and an anti-“woke” law. He pushed a ton of anti-trans bullshit and so on. And that crap didn’t fly in other states.

Florida is a perfect storm of GOP insanity. Endemic regular GOPers, furious Cuban voters who view everyone left of dick Cheney as Castro, and a never ending tide of boomer retirees. It sucks we are going to have to deal with a deep red Florida until boomers die off because they will have a lot of free electoral votes from it. Floridas gain has bee be the GOP elsewhere loss though.
that doesnt sound like the biggest problem, until you take a population of 1 billion, and factor in the gap of 50 million people, and the gap is likely wider with younger generations than smaller ones, and selection pressure makes it more likely that men have more partners than the other way around.
In America men are also increasingly not finding partners for the reasons you listed, that women are more educated and working now and expect more equality in the household, and men aren't keeping up.

also you cannot actually be serious that “men expect women to do more housework” is the single, let alone the largest reason young men are lonely and single. do you realize how narrow-minded you have to be to believe some bullshit like that? i will put money down on a bet that i can google “why are young men in the usa lonely and single” and i don’t find that “data” until maybe page 3 on an unrelated incel page.

and i knew a lot more women that cheated on their spouses in the military but i’m not out here saying it’s because “women can’t stay monogamous”.

it sounds like you personally just haven’t been lucky with the men you choose to date or surround yourself with if a generalization like that is your actual conclusion.

I see this as a subsidy for American industry. The government doesn’t necessarily have to turn a profit on projects and, in theory, the economic growth generated should come back in revenues.
And in this case we're not talking about a private corporation, we're talking about the federal government, the dollars they're spending isn't private profit, it's public tax revenues. We're talking about spending taxpayers dollars here, not Elon Musk's.

My preferred political subreddit is quick to get their panties in a bunch about Joe Biden's protectionism. Protectionism is, technically, an unforced and avoidable economic inefficiency, giving preference to a contractor besides the lowest bidder is a good way to spend more money, and in the case of the government it's the taxpayers who cover the costs....

Sure, except in this case protectionism would mean keeping money here in the United States (which is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the world) rather than buying from poorer nations where the money could do more good.

The whole point I was making was simply this: It's not black and white, there are benefits to free trade and there are drawbacks, there are benefits to protectionism and there are drawbacks.

And I think most of the countries that benefit from our free trade policy, it doesn’t really help their poor that much because their governments are so corrupt. The only country I can think of that actually, the whole country benefited and isn’t totally fucked is Vietnam.
So are you going to quit voting? Wasting it on a right-wing Libertarian nut? Vote for Christo-fascists who tried a coup? Lots of angry talk here. Better to try to improve the Dems than give the country to autocratic, gun-loving, hateful, racists and theocrats.
It's unfortunate the old guard and "centrist" bullshit still has such a stranglehold on the Dem party. They can win if they stop their bizarre obsession with white male voters - white voters in general. They aren't coming back for whatever reason. Continuing to be fascist light won't change that. Americans are progressive. Start fighting for progressive ideas and give the people something to vote for. That will never happen because the status quo benefits the Dem assholes as much as the republican assholes. They don't want anything to change and this guy Jeffries proves it. Just a minority face on the same old horse shit liberal policies.

If pfizer is printing money hand over foot for a live saving drug, why would they not be out performing the market? It's because the business isn't actually as risk free as people want to believe.
It's an indicator of profits and company growth potential. Pfizer has good profits but has bad growth potential because pharma is not a great field for growth because there is a ton of risk with developing new drugs.

Pfizer "risked" two billion dollars on the , Comirnaty vaccine, and with a 300 million dose order of COVID Vaccine already secure in their back pockets, then closed out 2022 with a revenue record, of over 100 Billion dollars. I will say, being middle aged, I've religiously had three Pfizer COVID shots now from the start of this pandemic virus, never got sick once, and If there's even a hint of covid-19 in the future, I'll get.

another shot. I sold health insurance for many years, but even in my little insurance office, I'd often feel like a crook: why? The U.S. is the only country out of the top 36 nations on earth, that does not have universal health care for all.

Let's be clear, when Republicans talk about mental health bills, they mean evaluation of things they perceive as abnormal to protect them from those things. See: start throwing LGBTQ+ people in asylums, removing their rights to things as well as putting them on a federal list that shows up in job background checks.

We can't make it illegal for domestic abusers to own guns, but calling their victims mentally ill would be their first step after a law about mental illness is created.

This isn't to say that investing in good mental health policies (there's a lot of bad ones) would help with a lot of things, just not person on person gun violence.

Nothing good can possibly come from Republicans trying to redirect the gun conversation into mental health. How about not letting domestic abusers have guns? Oh, wait, those are their people though...
Thats the thing though- India doesn’t need to anything that is not directly in line with its geopolitical interests and in the interests of its citizens. Same goes with Ukraine. India has already sent a shitton if humanitarian aid to Ukraine - which is a reasonable contribution from a country which has constantly put forth the narrative on global stage that “this is not our war”.
Regarding the Russian military imports- that is a failure of historical US diplomacy which pushed india into Russian hands since the cold war. India cannot just stop buying Russian weaponry now when 70% of its army uses it. And let me remind you that India IS and HAS BEEN DIVERSIFYING away from Russian armament- not because of any ill-placed moral policing by Western armchair redditors- but because , again, doing so is better for its diversification .

Of course, India has been diversifying since then, because it's pragmatic and knows depending on a single country for national defence is not a great plan. France has always been a reliable partner in terms of defence because it doesn't dictate heavy-handed terms like the US does.

I don't think India has ever shown unreliable in its cooperations with France in the past. They're reputed to take some time to decide things, but to stick to what's agreed after contracts are signed.
It's also done this way, so people can't try to coerce Ukraine to just giving in. Russia has decided it will throw as many bodies at the war as needed to win, because losing is not an option for a narsacist like Putin. If Ukraine's losses were reported in the same manner, the narrative would shift to them just giving up for the sake of the people. They just don't take in to account that Ukrainian people would rather fight to the last breath, than give in to Putin.
Zelensky knows he has full US and NATO support. Russia will lose no matter what, just how long they drag it out is up to them. We just need to repeat the same line, no peace until Ukraine, ALL of Ukraine, is free from Russian control.

So you think Ukraine should invade russia in order to win the war? Would that satiate your victim complex? I do not think they should do that. As much as my opinion on russia and Russian people has hit the floor recently I still don't approve of making innocent people suffer. I guess we have a different view on the worth of human lives.
The special district had allowed Disney to act as its own government for over five decades, controlling everything from land use to running its own fire department, and saving itself millions in taxes annually.
If approved, the board will garner the power to manage the special district’s infrastructure, services, taxing authority and more. DeSantis suggested Monday that the board might push for a say in Disney’s content if the corporation wants its tax-friendly home base to remain as is.

We need to stop demonizing people who we have tensions with and trying to appeal to their more accommodating section of their population and let them lead the change. These people are willing to act as a shield. When the incidence of outrage reaches it's absolute point, it will reflect what kind of change they are willing to fight for. When young jews are ordered to shoot other jews in protest, how will the nationalists deny they haven't murdered their own. The schism is real there and obviously being on the correct side of history feels much more appealing. Let's stamp out all forms of organized fascist conspiracies.
"They want to kick out their own families from their own homes" is like saying "the bad guys always wear purple, now shoot those random purple shirt wearers. I'm not even trying anymore WHEEEEEE!" I don't think you understand the fascism of Israel and how based on insular loyalty it is.

The Israeli right, in my experience, is emotionally built by those with a deep, volatile distrust. Or at least, the cynical, self serving netanyahu uses their paranoia of the rest of mankind to keep a strangle hold of power.

your mistake is assuming the Israeli right is made up the ancestors of Holocaust victims. Israel was founded as essentially a version of a socialist paradise (the Bund, the kibbutz movement) by Ashkenazim. But, most Mizrahim are right wing. Shas is a Mizrahi party. Likud has huge Mizrahi support. Ben Gvir is Mizrahi. The speaker of the Knesset is a gay Mizrahi. Israeli politics is a patchwork of tribal parties.

The Israeli electorate is very polarized. The vote counts from last election stood at almost exactly 50%-50% for and against to current coalition, which, if all votes were counted would have led to a political deadlock (the same one that led to 5 elections in the last 4 years).
Wouldn't this essentially give the clearing agencies (CIA, NSA, FBI, etc) the power to veto any candidate? It sounds good in theory, but in practice I think it could open the door to significant abuse.
There is a potential for abuse. Unfortunately I think that’s always the case. Not having any background checks or security clearances strikes me as the greater evil, however.

Security clearance is notably more complex. A security clearance level for lawmakers would need to be established. And the process of awarding clearance would need to be insulated from political interference.

I live on a dirt road so unfortunately… not a chance. They grate the roads and spray them with a sodium mixture. I’m pretty convinced that it’s a state wide conspiracy to make us all have to buy cars all of the time given our auto industry here.

I live a bit more south in the Midwest and we've had maybe two snowfalls all year? Aside from one bad cold snap, this just has to be a record for the warmest winter we've ever had. It's rained far more than it's snowed. Seems like the temperatures average in the high 30s, maybe low 40s. We've had several days in the mid and high 40s and even high up in the 50s. Usually the temperature here would rarely reach the high 30s.

Dozens on just ONE route There are over 233,000 routes in the US. If this is how the post office does things- and it must be because here's the proof right in the side of the road- that means over 5 million ballots At least!
Yeah. "Dozens" in a mail bag mixed with everything else. However this went missing, the ballots likely have nothing to do with the motive and are incidental.

I found three news reports of postal carriers dumping ballots (and other mail) in the past few years. New Jersey, Boston, and Kentucky. In all 3 cases, the ballots had not yet been filled out. The person requesting the ballot wouldn’t receive it, and would hopefully go vote in person.

I might be slightly happier if we stopped changing the clocks, but I find myself with literally the “young kids going to school in the morning” consideration. They walk about a quarter mile, and I pass families walking their kids up to half a mile. If we didn’t change the clocks back to standard, they’d be walking before sunrise part of the year. And if we didn’t switch back to daylight savings, I wouldn’t get to enjoy long evenings in the summer. So I deal with walking around my house for a few minutes updating clocks, and feeling a bit out of sorts for a day or two.
Firstly, you mean NATO. Ukraine has always been part of the UN, even when it was part of the Soviet Union.
Thirdly, even if Ukraine was joining NATO, it is a wholly illogical reason for Russia to invade the country. NATO is a defensive alliance that deters Russian invasions. By this very logic: Russia only has invaded Ukraine to ensure that it can maintain potential control over the country, and not lose the ability to invade at a later date.

In every way you look at it, Russia’s NATO expansion excuse only makes sense if you interpret it as “We have wanted to control Ukraine and we only invaded because we were afraid we would lose our ability to do so.”.

Didn't Ukraine want that for themselves after previous Russian aggression, including annexing Crimea several years earlier? Russia has been a threat to Ukraine for some time, especially after moving to a democracy very recently, with Russia having a fear it would be successful and hurt the influence Russia has on the region, and especially what Russians would think about a successful democracy in their neighbor. The US may have supported their joining the UN, and ultimately NATO, but the reasons for Ukraine to do so are entirely based upon Russian aggression. Even the primary reason for the US to really get involved, beyond the humanitarian reasons, is because Russian has actively been working on undermining democracies in the western world.
They haven't been at war for a very long time, that much is for sure. The last time was in 1979 and even that was just 3 weeks of war that was mostly just meant to demonstrate that the Soviet Union would not help Vietnam.
Holy economics101 Batman. First off, the US is extremely prosperous right now. The rich-poor split is by design, not by accident. Secondly, you don't get to a higher level of prosperity by bringing back jobs that add less value. To increase prosperity, you need to add jobs that add more value than the average job does currently.

Not gonna happen. We don't even have full sanctions on Russia yet. Plenty of trade is still happening. But Russia is nowhere near as important as China for Western economies. If we ban trade with China, we mostly hurt ourselves, not China.

China can sanction US and EU too, like stop buying anything from US and EU, or stop selling ? Both are good.

That was pretty good. I’d add that China will pretty much have to write off Taiwan as a to-do item for this century if Russia is soundly defeated in Ukraine. So if the Taiwan issue ‘’ they pretty much have to support Russia with lethal aid. But you are correct, you’d think they’d be a little nuts to jack up their current economic clout.
Being allowed to show up Trump and get away with it, is going to encourage all the rest of them to lie outrageously. Oh, what am I saying? They all lie outrageously.
At this point, him telling the truth should make the news because his incessant lying seems to be the norm.

What I’ve seen is “we believe in ‘innocent until proven guilty’.” So even the stuff he’s admitted he lied about, as far as the House GOP is concerned, is not a lie until he’s been convicted of it. This is how low their bar is these days. I mean, there are multiple members of their caucus under criminal investigation as we speak. That the party of law and order, the party of personal responsibility, the party of the adults in the room would pretend this is OK says a whole lot about how hollow their franchise is.

Of course, once people like Sarah Palin and Trump showed the path, it became clear to the broader public that most Republican voters really only care that you say what they’re all thinking, they don’t care at all about your character or even basic facts about your identity.

Seriously, I’d be patting myself on the back so hard if I managed to win a seat in Congress on a bet, with the lone stipulation being that 95% of my candidacy had to be a lie. That’s a tremendously successful grift.
If you're gullible and put faith in the reported numbers from Russia then, yeah. It's not as if they're caught lying on a daily basis.
And much in the same way the economic effects of the pandemic hasn't been felt until now Russia won't feel the full effects of their war until next year.

Half of the world treats them like nothing happens, so unless we have world war where we actively tackle India and China together, I'd be rather realistic and knowing that Russia won't be beaten economically anytime soon. Just look how long cold war took before Russia collapsed.

This is why helping Ukraine is so important, Russia is willing to have decade or two of recession just to secure this land for centuries. As a Polish person I realize how much people must suffer to revert it later and how fragile freedom is when you are between two imperialistic powerhouses.

Russia has a lot of gold reserves, it's richest people own big chunk of the world in real estate and stocks and stuff, which is covered by Switzerland and tax havens, plus it sits on biggest reserves of almost all resources available on this planet.

Russians are fine cuz they used reserves to rebuild their currency. Russia can hold cuz its fucking rich, but it costs them a lot and when the war is finished it will only get worse for them, regardless if they win or lose. The longer it goes the worse for an average Russian.

The Russian economy has been hit hard and will suffer even more. But this will not change their behavior.

Spoiler they usually only collapse due to internal political ambitions that highjack the "people". E.g Sudan, Mali, Zimbabwe, Nigeria etc... After decades.
how ‘bout vaccinated donate for vaccinated, and unvaccinated patients can only get blood from unvaccinated donors, and let’s just fuckin’ see how that plays out...
Yeah I mean wouldn’t not giving vaccinated blood to unvaccinated people solve the same problem that that guy is presenting in that, they don’t know if the blood is safe? If you don’t know if the blood is safe don’t take it I guess.

Why would you lie to give blood? That seems insanely wrong to do ethically. It's not worth it to society to do that. The personal details help determine if your blood is safe to use. If you don't want to share personal details, regardless of sexual orientation, you shouldn't be donating blood. Also.

Sure. My guess is that will quickly exacerbate our national blood supply shortage past critical and right on into, sorry, we don't have any more blood at all. Why? Because the type of people who donate blood give a shit about their fellow humans and as such probably got the vaccine because, you know, they give a shit about their fellow humans. Anyway, fuck fascists.

Perhaps they are doing this to ally with Russia TO GET NUKES. They aren’t idiots who think they can beat NATO. But Russia needs money and support and has the one thing Iran is really looking for.
Until Russia, as repayment for their help, starts providing Iran tech support for their military. Israel is not going to let Iran strenhen itself sufficiently to be an actual threat.

I find it really hard to come up with a scenario that the majority of Western populations will agree with a brutal invasion of a weaker opponent. But Iran getting nukes is one of them.

No they are not or else they would have shut down Iran selling Russians missiles. To be honest they have done almost nothing lately. Their silence is deafening.
One Danish right-wing loonie does something dumb, and now somehow Sweden is attacking Turkey and Islam.
He couldve burned anything else to annoy Erdoğan and not be racist to the immigrants in Sweden. Everyone can get behind his right to free speech. Holding his actions to be equilevant to free speech is wrong however. His motives werent "free speech". Im criticising his actions, not his right to do them. And that false equilevance is quite bothersome. Its how you get away with supporting blatant racism.

People cant support racism but they can support freedom of speech, so thats what he does. Thats how people can support his right to "burn a book". People cant openly say muslim bad and support the dude. But everyone can support freedom of expression.

More like a reversed brexit yeah, scotts only wnated to remain in EU and they got dragged of it because the rest of the kingdom voted to exit.
Still, the idea of idependance was here way before brexit, it just conforted scotts they want to be autonomous even more.

No issue with self determination in principle, although the idea that the UK is just a ‘union’ that you can leave, rather than a nation state, will always underplay the complexities of independence.

An independence referendum is really a case of dividing a country into two pieces. Except that one of the two pieces is unfairly not allowed to vote, even though they are affected by the event. So one half of the divided country gets to practice "self determination", but the other half does not. Actually even the losing half of the vote doesn't really get self determination unless they are allowed to vote to secede from the seceders. Follow this to the ultimate conclusion of everybody seceding from everybody else and you end up with a bunch of people just deciding which laws they feel like following.
If no one holds them accountable, it's effectively legal. Too many of our laws have no real teeth, except for the ones involving loss of life or property crimes. The punishements for stealing property are are far greater than those of stealing elections or swindling average people of millions of dollars. I know which one affecrs society more. Yet the serious crimes related to safe and legal elections are not punished.
So are they notified that if they vote, they will be committing a felony? Because at that point, the only recourse is to let them vote after election day. This is an absolute constitutional disaster. You obviously can't let Ricochet Rabbit here and a handful of anarchists just say, "no black people can vote unless under threat of imprisonment". Kemp should be impeached and the anarchists imprisoned for election fraud.

It's too late. You are missing what this is. These people were notified that their right to vote was being challenged by the state and that voting MAY cause them to be imprisoned with felony voter fraud.

Don’t forget the courts saying, “Well, yes, that is illegal voter suppression but it’s too late to do anything about it this election. Better luck next time.”.
Yes, on a personal level it sucks for the athletes but Russia deserves no such international platform to pretend they're still part of the rules based international order of nations.
IIRC I remember seeing that the official Russian federation team are banned but Russian athletes could still compete as a russian team of some form.

Could be made quite simple that Russian athletes that don't support the war could be allowed to compete under the Olympic organisations flag. Afterall, the actions of the state does not speak for the view of everyone from that state. This isn't going to bat for Russia, just stating an option that exists with the International Olympic Commitee which could be used for a select number of athletes if they meet criteria. I'm not particularly interested in making it an ethnic thing, I'm more interested in the Russian state being repulsed and punished.

Zelensky is always going to go for the maximalist position, naturally (as has, tbf, Putin). The rest of the world can take what it views as reasonable. I personally agree wirh the IOC, but some others won't. Meh. Is what it is, I'm not particularly interested in bashing Zelensky even where I disagree with him. That's just politics, he's playing to the Ukrainian audience, who have understandably very strong feelings on this.

Just noting the mechanism that exists for those who can't compete as their nations representatives. It happened to some Russian athletes before, as well as some stateless people from Syria and Somalia iirc.

But don't underplay the sheer size and organisation that has happened with Russia athletes. To the point where it was organised and sponsored from the top down.
I'm not a socialist, but 1% of the people in America owning 30% of the wealth, or whatever the latest number is, is ridiculous and fucks over the 99%. What rich people, sorry, I mean job creators, don't understand is that if there's no middle class, nobody can buy your stuff. Greed is evil.
I believe the paradigm of socialism, or one of them, is wealth distribution. Saying I'm not a socialist reinforces to me, that the the wealthy are pushing this kind of government tilt and even non-socialists agree it is warranted.

I would argue that we're at a point right now where things are about to break, in part, because we spent decades convincing ourselves that the choice was somehow not between socialism or barbarism.

I got news for you. The system we live under right now could confiscate anyone's wealth at will in a host of ways. But the people who are pestered with IRS audits, civil forfeitures, debt collectors, social security liens, medical debt, fees from being chewed up and spat out of our criminal justice system, etc. are the working class first and foremost.

There is no USSR to go back to. Also, it's a foolish comment for the reason that rather than discuss with me about the kind of society we ought to be fighting for and working towards, you just want to deflect to an entirely different country - and one that no longer exists at that.

I think we ought to lean into the fact that it is socialism vs. capitalism and get ourselves knowledgeable, organized, serious, and mobilized.

I particularly enjoy it, as a non-American, when republicans (both the politicians and voters) handwring and fearmonger about the American "extreme left".

Here's the thing. Symbology is literally literature. I'm using symbology (which spell check says I'm spelling wrong ffs) to communicate with you, and you with me. Did I steal the word symbology? No, I'm communicating something. Same thing when I play you a melody. Like John Lennon said, paraphrasing... it comes from the universe and goes back into the universe, and I'm just a vessel. So are you. So is everyone.

Well, Christ feeding the masses is a pivotal part of the tale, fish and loaves. I never really look at anything as being "stealing from" in history, because everything is built on the past, every single thing about us. Fish was important to the ancient Greeks for sure, given their geography of course, but it was just as important to people eating it centuries later.

The fish most obviously represents Jesus' whole deal, really. That's probably why they suppressed it once it was no longer a movement of the poor but instead a government over them.
Correct me if I'm wrong : only the melting of LAND ice would raise the sea level. The SEA ice (floating iceberg) however, regardless of melting or forming, does NOT affect sea level.
Yes, an iceberg is partially submerged and partially above the water. That is because ice is less dense than water.
Yes, an iceberg is partially submerged and partially above the water. That is because ice is less dense than water.
Unfortunately, you are also incorrect. I stand by my statement, melting sea ice makes no change to sea level. First to make a quick correction, most of the iceberg is below the surface. The density of ice is less than but close to the density of water.

How do we get the ice to float? Displace the equivalent mass in water. How much volume should that be? From above, at the density of water, it needs to displace 100 volume units. That leaves 10 volume units of the ice remaining visible above the surface.

Ice is less dense, so takes up a larger volume, it displaces its weight and then the rest is above the waterline.

Plus the whole bit of the iceberg (most of it) which is above the water, and will become water, adding to you know, the general amount of water. Far outweighing any water displacement. This is why boats don't make sea levels rise by any significant, measurable factor. Adding lots of melted ice (water) does indeed however, increase the amount of water.
But Ukraine isn't going to honor the land grab of it's own soil. It's idiotic to " NO this our land now. You can't have. It's Russia now and you can't attack us directly. yep yep yep. That's how it works".
Russia is Trying to use the fact Ukraine doesn't want to strike sovereign Russian soil (they do but it may escalated the conflict).

Yes, there needs to be accountability for content like illegal content (CP) or offensive content (hate speech) which is why we reports and moderation. There is a form of this accountability already in place. not perfect, but it's there.

It's not always perfect, of course not. But it's not being done to any measure of effective degree currently, so I propose we start where we are and get a bill going in the Senate with committee meetings and discussions to hash out exactly what kind of standards to de-platform far right extremist hate content and lies can we implement today on social media and web hosting companies.

Similarly, there are certain web hosting domains and social media platforms that purposely advertise themselves as a safe haven for "free speech" And when you pull back the curtain you discover that a alarming percentage of far-right extremist content is hosted on a few key social media and web hosting services.
This is how our current era will end. Individual selfish politicians looking to increase their power at the expense of the system, and thinking that it couldn't possibly collapse or even worse, just not caring.
I think those people realize that it doesn't matter if everyone else is poorer, as long as they themselves get richer.

Money up top isn't just about living a comfortable lifestyle or having decently nice things, it's about the ability to wield influence and holding power, a social structure based on being more or less wealthy than the other guy, and not just having "nice" things but rare things. The social structure varies depending on how much money you have. Just having the money itself really isn't what matters, because everyone in your circle has that money. At that point, you need other ways to put yourself up top. Networking and power.
If he replies then Putin is running around trying to show that he is alive and his actions are being manipulated by Zelensky.
I hope he is alive and stays alive because if something happens to Putin there is a chance that Medveded might take control and he is worse than Putin.

Putin is scared as fuck to go public, becase of the current situation, if he is still alive. Btw he was an entitled coward for like 15 years at least, when it became clear that his politics is shit and majority of population despise him.

If you check out, he has the same background actors in every public appearance for like a decade.

So by me choosing not to align as a Democrat then I must be a Republican? What kind of ass backward logic is that? I am a moderate and I'll vote for whichever candidate reflects my values most. Sometimes that is a Democrat and sometimes that is a Republican.
I would agree that the only right choice at the state and national level are Democrats. Local politicians I had two Republicans I backed for council positions.

Don't even look at it tonight. It'll look like the GOP ran away with it but early and mail in votes won't be counted until after midnight so the numbers will be massively skewed before those actually get counted.

Common sense would say that early voting and mail in ends before election day, giving straggler ballots a few days to trickle in. Election day then becomes your last chance.

Early voting ends before election day. All mail in ballots should need to be posted/post marked by that same day. There's then time for mail in ballots to trickle in before election day. Election day becomes everyone's last chance. There's no logical reason for all the stupid problems we seem to have in the USA. We need and should be allowed to expect a functional system.
Oh no.What pisses me off most is the fact that the rainbow has been stolen by gay activists.nothing against gays btw.wearing multi colours now means your lgbtq.why take all the colours,greedy.
All I see is Dave Chappelle still being correct on how the LGBTQ community gets more done for whites than for gays. It's more white privilege nowadays than it is about true Inclusivity. That's why we're voting on articles about priviliged whites feeling that they let migrants die in the thousands for their hats to be the most accepted article of discussion. Oh the poor rainbow hats on those alive walking over the dead and in front of the workers never paid. Oh woe is the privileged Oh sob Oh decry this unwavering sense of oppression on my rights...only now when I am on vacation I can afford over the serfs. Next week we want to see Notre Dame, The Vatican, and all the sundown towns slave towers where Blacks and Indigenous were sold in America...then they cry over us choosing to remove our oppression. Europeans are the worst.
The problem is, this GOP clown show is sucking all the attention away from serious issues. Take the current healthcare collapse, for example (I’m an ER nurse). While McCarthy, Santos, MTG and the other crazies scream at the Dems and plot their revenge, the country is going to shit. Where is the “better” Republican healthcare plan they promised OVER TEN YEARS AGO? And from this shit show we’ve seen in their first month, I don’t expect this Republican majority House to get any work done for the next 2 years. Everyone please take care of yourself, the wait for care in the ER gets longer every day.
Yes, their malfeasance/criminality absolutely should be exposed in the media. But despite him being out of office for 2 years, Trump’s MAGA cult of personality continues to dominate the news—on both conservative and liberal outlets. It’s like a reality freak show that even MSNBC can’t resist. I’ve had to go on a news fast ever since the marathon McCarthy circus. I also quit twitter after that megalomaniac Musk took over. And now he’s brining back Trump, ffs! It’s like being trapped in an episode of Black Mirror on a loop. I’m depending on you fine people at reddit to post breaking news if and when any of them are indicted. 🤯.

Since the (compromised by Republicans) ACA was passed in 2010, the Democrats have spent most of the intervening years defending against further cuts to healthcare by Republicans. Wins for Democrats have been small, but significant: Such as drug pricing reform, supporting State Medicaid Expansion, and providing billions in pandemic relief. (The later vitally important considering Trump spent the critical first year of the pandemic denying COVID was even a serious health threat.).

2. Santos at this point is starting to show something that might be as bad as an total health care collapse, if not worse. Which might be a lot broader then just Santos, namely how much the GOP and perhaps even America democracy in total has been infiltrated by foreign money.

And as it turns out that the FBI counter intelligence was bought by the Russians, and his girlfriend was staying with Giuliani. Showing that the Russians might have been more influential then known so far in 2016 .
Your take amuses me a little. Do you not see that your position precisely plays exactly into the divisive narrative that China and Russia play up? How is this irony lost on you?
Their quick and dirty playbook is simple- foment discord within domestic groups; promote an “us vs them” mentality and get the domestic population to start mistrusting those who it perceived as having power - and if you can get more than one group to dislike and mistrust another than more power to you.

Focusing solely on perceived enemies and false equivalencies (conservative MP’s ≠ QAnon nutters) not only suggests your personal bias (hence my disengagement), but is used by bad state actors to foment civil strife as a secondary goal.

It also distracts from evidence that we have that the Chinese are very much attempting to influence all parties. In the last election we had disturbing allegations of electoral interference against conservative candidates, including who proposed a registry to track foreign influence in election campaigns. O’Toole also alleged interference which initially seemed like sour grapes until CSIS confirmed that there were indeed significant attempts to influence certain ridings.

I don’t like these QAnon nutters either, and it’s been widely suggested that these folks are being unwittingly influenced by foreign actors - but if you let your personal bias blind you to how widespread this is, it hurts the country.
And now there is a huge push against public education. They're defunding libraries and attacking colleges. They argue that's colleges are 'woke', but in reality (according to statistics) people who are Democrats tend to be more educated and more empathetic, as well as visa versa.
They're deliberately trying to make a less educated population because less educated people make better wage workers and people won't fight it if they don't have the critical thinking to realize they're getting a raw deal. It's always been about pulling the wool over our eyes so the elite class can rule without government intervention. Most of the actual politics the right wing are pushing are targeted to limit the government's ability to function and sow doubt about facts that 99% of the scientific community agree on. It's become the party of misinformation and subterfuge. There's very little that the entire right wing party actually agrees on, and the things they do agree on are regressive as well as detrimental to our whole society.

The whole point was an attempt to explain to the public just how much the Overton window has shifted right and how there isn’t a real left anymore, contrary to those that talk about the non-existent “extreme left”.

I know its frustrating. I have family that I can just no longer deal with on these sorts of issues. They got mad at me saying “It’s just politics!” completely ignoring that beliefs beliefs are what form their actions.

There was a comparison done on MSNBC of some major policies between Reagan and Obama. Many policies were actually identical while on others, surprisingly, Obama was further right than Reagan was.
The Republicans have been confirming their judges for DECADES, while refusing to confirm Democratic appointees. This really became apparent during the Obama years. And the Democrats just wrung their hands in dismay. So yeah, I guess you're right.
That's your opinion. Whether I agree or not doesn't matter; religion is a big part of the lives of a lot of people, and for that matter, a lot of good people. Many people give to charity because of how they believe; their religion forms the backbone of their moral code. The day we start telling people what beliefs we don't accept as valid we begin the slippery slope to an authoritarian government.

Despite her being in a cultish church, I don't think there's actually much there for her personally though. I don't know of any allegations against her, and she hasn't lied about anything I'm aware of. I don't agree with her positions on things, but beyond that, I don't think there's much of a story.

I think she's pretty clear that she doesn't consider it a settled law. She clearly defined what settled law was and explained why she didn't believe Roe qualified. Late justice Ginsburg expressed similar concerns, and, frankly, if you actually read about Roe, it's a very weird case. There are other cases that actually establish women's rights in respect to abortion much more strongly than Roe. (For example we have several cases here in NC that still serve as precedent in the absence of Roe.).

TIL about NXIVM. I don’t really consider myself misinformed about the news, but I swear I never heard about this. Sadly it was because I was sucked into a post about Brett Kavanaugh. 😡.
Actually it had very important military consequences. Before that raid Japanese army was opposed to navy plan of taking Midway, considering it too risky and poorly planned. But after raid army felt humiliated and agreed to follow that plan to restore its honour. And we know how it ended.
The problem is that you cannot destroy those sites instantly, and as soon as mass missile launch is detected, all nukes will fly from their silos. If USA could destroy nuclear arsenal of its main enemy with zero consequences, it would have done so a long time ago.

There aren't anywhere near as many sub nukes as other nukes, so if you could take out most ground nukes you'd still wipe out most of their nukes.

Well,... unfortunately it doesn't take all the nukes to do irreversible damage. Imagine that just 2 missiles get through. One for Europe one for the East Coast of the US. I can't remember if it were six or eight warheads per missile, but ultimately if the 8 largest cities per destination are destroyed, the economy, political landscape and quite frankly the environment, would be irreversible destroyed.
Rammed both of them into massive storms. It's such a shame. Zeppelins could see submarines at periscope depth, so not one ship was ever attacked by a sub while in sight of an airship or balloon. A couple of those flying aircraft carriers would have been real useful in the Atlantic during the early stages of World War II. And you know that airships would have gotten tons of investment over the 30s and 40s. Don't know if they would have survived jets and radar, but I am sad that I'm not in the timeline with badass flying aircraft carriers in World War II.
In the 1920s the US experimented with flying aircraft carriers. They built two Zeppelins that could launch and land fighter planes. They were called the USS Macon and the USS Akron.

There's no "gatcha" for them to be had here, unless they want to scuttle the first serious diplomatic visit aimed at deescalating tensions in years. I mean, what political capital would they get? The official statement form the Chinese side was that the thing was out of control and deep inside restricted American air space, the sort of air space that would see a commercial air liner intercepted by fighter jets and forced to land/shot down if it refuses. Of course it'll get shot down. During the Cold War the US floated dozens of those balloons over China and had a few of them shot down so it's not unprecedented.

we shot down a chinese spy balloon, that's all 98% of anyone will ever remember about this event, no matter what unfolds down the line.
A 30% price hike on essential goods, which will include utilities, will shut the lights off on probably about a fifth of American households. That means the elderly and sick are going to freeze or cook in extreme weather, there will be no way for many of them to cook or bathe, and no food storage. I think that's where you're going to see the country fold in on itself.
I think a 30% sales tax -- which would effectively be 40-45% after state and local taxes -- could actually tip the scales and lead to true riots.

They want people to pay 30% on every purchase ($30 for every $100 spent) but are trying to pass it off as a 23% tax because $30 tax divided by $130 is 23%.

Yea. People forget WV was/is the last bastion of the old southern democrats. Senator Byrd voted against the civil rights act and he was in office until 2010.
It is completely accurate to say that Democrats got the tax returns, because basically only Democrats are trying to get his tax returns.
Why would you say “Democrats Are Now In Possession…” By law the tax returns are being handed over to Congress. You make it sound like they are being given exclusively to the Democrats. Not true. This is all about government, not party specific (except that Republicans will probably at least pretend that they don’t want to see them).

Part of the problem is dems/Republicans only work together to prevent third parties from getting on ballots. Andrew Yang had a pod episode talking about it, it’s wild the shot they do.

If you want to run for President your whole life becomes an open book. The public should have access to at least 10 years worth of your actual tax returns maybe even all your tax returns. No bullshit short BS form. EVERYTHING. How can we elect anyone who will be the most powerful figure in the world and not demand to know them inside and out. It’s fing preposterous.

Seriously it’s ridiculous. If anything was there, it would have come out a decade ago. We all know Big Tech billionaires pay very little taxes, percentage-wise. Why would another billionaire be any different. They’re all just playing their game.
That’s crazy I will say that at least you have a public transportation system, we only have busses in major cities the biggest have limited rapid trains - very limited. If I want to go to to a city 6-7 hours away from where I live I have to drive, there is no transit of any kind that will take me there, possibly I could fly IF that city has an airport…. We did have greyhound bus lines which you could buy a ticket to drive between city’s on but they were a private company that shut down.
We have a large country with a small population so public transportation is not good, there are so many places even in the city that you can’t even catch a bus. A monthly transit pass in Edmonton is $100. I live in a suburb of Edmonton you can get a bus into Edmonton from one area of my town a few times a day but it’s not practical and costly.

Before with standard fuel prices it cost me $180, so $20 less than the train fares, and I still had to pay for petrol to get to the train since buses don’t operate early enough to get me there in the morning.

Yes there is wear and tear on my car, I have a 120km round trip commute. It costs me about $240 a month for fuel with the high prices as they are now.

I thought this was amazing, and that australia needs to get in on something like that again. Except for the recent fuel inflation, it was cheaper to drive to work than catch the train.
edit: reading further into it, i shouldnt have commented based on assumptions i dont know anything about, they did have a deal.
with the difference being that germany has settled their debts in treaties and such, i think japan never aknowledged their crimes?

I feel like Japan can learn from Germany on how to deal with its shameful WW2 actions. Stuff like banning organizations like Nippon Kaigi, removing the names of war criminals from Yasukuni Shrine, banning Imperial Japan symbols, etc.. The Germans have done all of this. Japan hasn't.

You shouldn't combine Germany and Japan together. The Japanese would do well by doing what the Germans did. Most Germans today will have no problems with condemning the Nazis. German politicians don't go to memorials that include Nazis, like the Japanese politicians do.

Where is the German equivalent? Where is the German equivalent for organizations like Nippon Kaigi which include major Japanese politicians as members?

Saying a lot of the Japanese government are members and the group has influence is dangerously close to things like "Illuminati/Jewish people/insert any group, rule the world". There just isn't anythung concrete to say it's true at all.
Russia breaks by May 2023. Russia is losing equipment, man-power, training, ammunition. Ukraine has 4x more equipment, man-power, training and ammunition as they did at the start of the war.
A squad of Russians finds a random Ukrainian guy, makes him put on a Russian uniform, and hands him a broken rifle.

that's what I was meaning they would send these kids into the ukrainian lines to soak of gunfire and expose ukrainian positions or at least exhaust there ammo. It would be hard to tell that their not russians if these kids are forced into russian uniforms.
What kind of “stinking thinking” is this??? How did this asshole get elected?? I feel for Alaska. Having this as a public official. Republican, of course.
It’s gotten to the point for me that I just have no clue what the fuck the Republican Party is, certainly not policy wise. The only things I observe as constants for them is hate and ignorance, with their words and actions a smoke screen so they can act like the shit bags they are.

I wish it weren’t so. It’s healthy to have debates by two or more honest parties, and I’d love to have a government made of people and parties that vehemently argued about how to assist society to be happy, healthy, and whole. Alas, cheating and what not is a trait of organisms, and unfortunately for us, institutions of power are natural paths of least resistant for those who lie, cheat, and steal. What’s also unfortunate is the opposite type of person doesn’t have time to police such a large institution, and apparently the safeguards are never adequate. Thus history repeats. Anyways, I’ve found myself rambling again!
Gets better, I looked it up because my recollection was fuzzy. Turns out they are using old nuke cruise missiles with the warhead replaced with ballast. They are running seriously low on missiles. Fuck Russia.
Interesting that you bring up the wave/echelon attacks. A Reddit comment lead me to this really interesting video that shows how a culture of lying and papering over short comings is what leads to this lemming like behavior. And, even though top leadership knows they are being bullshitted they go along with it, because Russian doctrine depends on mathematical models that are only as good as the information they plug in. And as long as your math shows your call is the correct one, and you have the receipts to show that the information you got is what you plugged in, you aren't held responsible. It is hard baked into their military culture to send men into meat grinders...

It's possible that they don't have warheads to place on them. No clue if they were designed to convert to conventional munitions. My best guess is at the very least they might help real munitions reach their target by overwhelming defense systems, but even then it shows that they need as many to connect as possible, if they had enough to spare they'd use live ones since some of thier inert ones are getting through and doing minimal damage.

I heard on NPR yesterday that in the latest barrages there were rockets with inert warheads on them mixed in. Russia is (l think) claiming its to throw off defensive systems by overwhelming them...but it could also be indicative of them running low on warheads to attach to rocket bodies.

Non-precision weapons are battlefield weapons, not the kind that fly hundreds of miles to attack power plants and substations far behind the front lines.

It doesn't matter how many rockets they toss at targets, they won't destroy power plants and substations in worrying numbers away from the frontlines which is what they've been trying to do.
I don't think these people read the article and realize it was a PI and not a tracker installed by the government. I assumed it was a government car with a tracker too until I actually clicked the link.
If you’re going to put a tracking device on a elected official vehicle maybe don’t make it easy to track you down? Now his life is fucked because he’s going to lose that Cabelas job and he’s going to lose his PI license.

I would guess the guy just lost his PI license, at the least. Probably a lot engage in this sort of stuff and don't get caught, although I'm not sure how someone would actually be able to use the info in a civil or criminal case since to do so would, in some places, effectively be an admission to a crime.

I get that. I'm sure that there are plenty of ways to incorporate illegally-obtained info without directly tying-in to how the info was gathered, if ethics are thrown out the window.

The point of parallel construction is that they you'll never know the illegally obtained information exists. It's never presented as evidence.

Example: illegal warrantless GPS tracker on your car shows you going to a storage unit in the middle of the night several times a week. Police now spend the resources to do a perfectly legal stake out at the times you normally go to that storage unit. They follow you and get enough probable cause to get a legal warrant to search the storage unit and find evidence of a crime.

Without the illegal tracker they never would have found the storage unit without spending way more resources to keep surveillance on you 24/7. But the courts will never know about that tracker.
It's all part of the ongoing right wing scheme to delegitimize the entire concept of governance and set us back to the Gilded Age.
Their entire messaging machine is built around the idea that the government is incapable of getting anything done, which they then make self-fulfilling prophecy by refusing to do anything when they're in office.

They have spent so much time being obstructionist and critical of the Dems that they have completely forgotten how to govern, and the people they have gotten elected are completely incapable of governing (e.g. Boebert, Gaetz, MTG, etc.).

2. Uninformed Older voters who don't know what's going on in the world at all b/c they have no real source of truth in their lives. All of their pain meds probably don't help their critical thinking.

It seems plainly obvious that the GOP has no interest in leading and are only interested in the perks and privileges allotted to them for being in charge.

I really wish that the older generations were more inclined to critical thinking and could see through all of the lies and stories they're told by conservative media sources.
We're moving out of state in a few weeks. Our son came out to us as trans at the end of last year. He's still only thinking in terms of going by another name, using he/him, having a shorter haircut, and wearing more masculine clothing. He isn't considering hormone therapy or other treatments. Even though this particular bill doesn't immediately impact him, I can only imagine that things will continue to escalate, with the way that things are going. I shouldn't be surprised at where our state is heading, but it seems like a new bill is introduced daily restricting the rights of Tennessee's citizens.
It's really sad. I wish I could remember where I saw it, but I recall reading language in a bill about restricting therapy services, particularly virtual therapy, for transgender individuals in Tennessee. They clearly don't want LGBT+ individuals to exist.

This will not stop with Trans people. They already hate kids and young voters. They will find more and more to hate. They are addicted to it. It is who they are.

That's true. I'm a Jew living in Los Angeles, where many Jews have already been attacked (including shot) and nazis are posting hate signs in many places. It's only a matter of time before the Republican party includes hatred of Jews as part of their official platform, like they have done with LGBT people.

The language the right wing is increasingly using in their attacks on the LGBTQ+ community (trans in particular) is the language of genocide, full stop.

That horrifying rhetoric will be followed by horrifying laws and horrifying violence by Republican mobs against trans people. Once they're done with that, they'll probably go after Muslims or Jews.
And for added context: Russia was in process of a missile strike campaign targeting most if not all major Ukrainian cities. So, he probably had good reason to believe so.
Yes it does. That's the simple truth. It sucks and I hate it but I'm saying even without that she's kind of a long shot. We need something more of a sure thing if Biden doesn't run.

Won't Biden be 82 by 2024? Even if he's mentally fit by then, does anyone really want to take the chance he'd last four more years being just as sharp between 2024 to 2028? Or to even live that long? "Four years" of health is a big difference between someone in their 40s and someone in their 80s.

IIRC, it was specifically Donald Trump who wanted to make the transition as difficult as possible because he's unbelievably petty. If it had been anyone else, it would have worked. But Biden and his team already had eight years of experience working as 2 that it was no issue.

The problem is if Biden doesn't run then Usually the VP ends up being the pick. And I don't mean to inject any negatives here but there is just no way Harris would win a national election like that. I mean even ignoring the racism and sexism in this country she just isn't that well liked by middle of the road swing voters. If Trump really is running again then we absolutely need a candidate that can win.
I was under the understanding that he took shit when he was allowed to with his position. They politely asked for it back and he lied saying he gave it all back. Too dumb to realize there's records. And the cops are using the fisher price route to get our shit back.
I've seen multiple people reiterate this on every trump news this week..i know it doesn't make sense I'm essentially quoting some magidiots.

How the fuck can't a billionaire hide paperwork any better than a supply closet at a low rent golf club and a rent a shed? I mean i know the juiciest stuff has sailed the 7 seas already 1st class, but goddamn if my hero was that fucking dumb I'd jump ship.

So what you’re saying is that every president until trump has followed the rules and that due to trumps obvious criminal activities the government will have to change their rules.
And then I ended up in the Deep South in the 7th grade and witnessed--easily--the majority of my public school class in rural Mississippi completely NOT understand sex. They were vulgarly open about the gossip and salaciousness of it, but pig fucking ignorant about it.
Absurd things like how women get pregnant or not. How fetuses develop and when. What even IS menstruation (I recall it wasn't until 9th grade when I found out that none of my male friends had any idea what was actually happening there--zero clue, just "women bleed monthly because of puberty"). What erections are and aren't. How they happen. De-mystified basic stuff.

I knew what periods were before the girls in my class would start having them. How humans procreated before I was biologically able to. It made the transition to puberty something I was pretty informed of by the time it hit.

I started puberty and my period at age 9. Which is when my mom sat me down with a medical book of diagrams and explained some basic things to me. 7th grade is insanely late to even start talking about things.

Just because the politician aligns with your political ideology doesn’t mean they are honest people. Both sides lie for political gain. In this instance, one is not trustworthy and the other is a liar.

It is astounding how people think isreal = jewish. Nah dude...a country is a country, and a people is a people. A country can be informed/led by a religion or culture, but it is NOT that religion nor culture.
This is the same reason you can Hate china and not be racist because you Love Taiwan and Hong Kong. Chinese isnt only in one place, Jewish isnt only in one place. Anti-semitism has literally no meaning in it that is connected to Israel.

you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims. the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa. the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%). it IS mostly anti semitism. to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above. furthermore. it is an offensive. stupid. strawman. trope. that i cant tell the difference. as a jew. when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.

Having a weird, seething hatred for Israel almost always ends up with the person being an antisemite. Like, almost always.
Why do you assume this? There's no logic to how FIFA works, this has been shown over and over again - money talks. They don't care about human rights, morals, ethics etc. those in charge in FIFA want to fill their pockets.
Yeah, FIFA alongside FIA can choke on their money. But really, dont expect much from teams, time for gestures is long overdue, you either take the chance to be remembered as an athlete who won World Cup, or as a mediocre activist who didnt really achive more than making a gesture.

You can adress it lol im just saying calling for boycotts is a little extreme, you have free speech say what you want bro its all good, its just my opinion that i have list of priorities rn and rainbow armbands doesn’t rank very high, because i expect most normal functioning people to still respect eachother regardless of rainbow armbands being approved or not by some rich fuck at fifa.

What ethics? The ethics of the organizers? You mean to tell me that just becauseyou didnt wear the armband means you agree with his actions? This is surface level judgement on people who probably trained their whole careers for this event.

Exactly, redditors in an outrage over shit they give 0 fucks about is commonplace and it’s so stupid, they just have to give their two cents in before calling to boycott or some other carelessly extreme measure likely to cause massive amounts of damage lol.
Ukraine isn't going to stop trying to get their entire country back and will continue fighting Russia and Russia's surrogates as they have since 2014 when Crimea and much of the Donbas was taken.
They will continue to fight because they simply have no choice, for losing will result in the Russian absorption of Ukraine and the utter destruction of their country and people. It is no coincidence that some of Ukraine's strongest supporters (Finland, the Baltics, Poland and Romania) know they might be next in line if Russia expansionism is not thwarted now.

I agree with the article headline, the West should change course in Ukraine by immediately providing all the conventional military support possible that Ukraine needs to drive Russia from their lands. Ukraine is willing to spill their own blood to secure their future, so let's give them the tools to do so and end this war quickly.

Ukraine is willing to wage a fight for independence and it is right for US and EU to provide Ukraine with the means to do it. Including providing Ukraine with nuclear weapons should Russia threaten that. US, Russia, UK, Ukraine signed the , Ukraine gave up nukes in return for sovereignty. Russia broke the agreement and invaded, perfectly justified for US to provide Ukraine with the weapons including the nuclear weapons agreed to give up in return full independence from Russia.

If we want the war to truely end the only realistic solution is to offer Ukraine a secret deal where they become full joint mutual defense members with the USA, UK, France, Germany, etc. Fuck turkey and their veto over NATO membership, we can sign mutual defence treaties without them. Put US soldiers at the boarder to make it clear if Russia shoots them we will respond with decisive force.

That way Russia cannot just 'restart the war' at their convenience and Ukraine is actually getting something of value from the international community in exchange for giving up a small amount of territory (like the Crimea pininsula) assuming they are unable to retake it in a reasonable time frame.
They are pulling their weight by providing funding, himars, ammunition and supplies. Though that is the least amount of work when the need of the hour is MBT’s.
I have seen this argument several times. But big strong America could surely be able to provide all the necessary logisitics to support ally ukraine.

I would hope that the US could push the Abrams to those countries that give up tanks to Ukraine. In fact, I would hope we provide a substantial discount to make that happen.

On the other hand, the Leopard plugs very easily into the existing structures they have, probably because Germany designed it for a number of diverse situations.

The Abrams is designed to exist within US logistical doctrines that allow it to be properly maintained and supplied. Ukraine’s logistics are based on Soviet doctrine that’s effective for the T-72. Ukraine would need to redesign the way it handles tanks from the ground up to incorporate the Abrams. If this were peace time that’s not a big deal, but there’s a war of survival going on.
The Soviet Union had America's number when it came to the space race. The first satellite, first astronaut (both male and female), first space station. But history was more or less remembered that America won the space race by putting a man on the moon.
America's capitalist economy was just superior. They identified the weakness and just outspent them at every turn, declaring more and more expensive projects that drained their coffers until they could no longer match it.

Tbh, much like America, the Soviets managed to "aquire" some Nazi scientists as they marched to Berlin during the end of WW2. It wouldn't be surprising that, similarly to early NASA, the Soviet space program contained a few of those in their team.

To be fair, there were 14 other countries alongside Russia when the Soviet Union did all their space projects and achievements.

How would you know he did if no call to action exists? Him revving them up is far more easy to digest then to think he planned for a bunch of dumb asses to storm their senate when they were out on recess.
Wouldn't we have heard of something triggering these people to go riot? I feel getting this many people to do anything would need a call to arms to set off.

That makes a lot more sense to me. I was so confused about why they are charging an ex-leader when said person didn't "do" anything specificly to kick off the riots thousands of miles away.

This means that when you're wondering how they could charge an ex-leader who didn't do anything, you're literally just asking why a situation you don't know anything about doesn't make sense to you. Knowing as little as you know about this situation, I have no idea how you were comfortable deciding that he didn't do anything.

The seven main sources of energy that are found in India. The sources are: 1. Coal 2. Mineral Oil 3. Natural Gas 4. Thermal Power 5. Firewood 6. Hydro Power 7. Nuclear Power.
India has 2nd largest in population and ranks 3rd for emmissions worldwide. Then consider the estimated $4-6 trillion /year needed by industrialized countries to reach net zero emmissions by 2030. I'm thinking India wants a cash infusion to help bolster its emerging market to make it 1 while diminishing other countries wealth by limiting their 'cheap' sources of energy.

But by continuing to increase their living standards they're pushing up the per-capita consumption, resulting in a population with a much bigger ecological impacts. Emmissions (300% increase since '90) will increase with increased production and distribution of consumable goods. A growing population will place increased demands on the 2/3 of the agrarian population (includes cows) [accounts for 76% of methane emmissions] and increased energy consumption (currently individual use is low) as the standard of living is improved. Air transportation accounts for about 1% of emissions but 9 more airports are planned for development. With only a slight dip in 2020(covid related) emmissions have been steadily increasing for the past several years and are projected to continue rising as more coal and gas/oil power plants are being built to meet the demands for energy.

If only coal is phased out, developing countries would need to construct gas/ petroleum based power plants till they have sufficient renewable infra to substitute, or go on massive infra spending on renewables right now.

So, if developed countries are really serious about phasing out fossil fuels, why not all fossil fuels, why should developing countries be forced to spend money right now while developed countries can sit around using their gas powered plants for longer period of time.

In short, India wants phasing out of all kinds of fossil fuels simultaneously from both developing and developed countries.

Well, he doesn’t have a website keeping track of all the time he spends golfing so he has exceed my expectations. Will be interesting how he handles this train spill as opposed to the last one with the same chemicals.
Also, the spill is handled by EPA, local authorities, etc. DoTs job is to investigate the derailment to determine if there was a breach of regulations, and then apply whatever penalties are legally available. I think the cap on fines is around 200k, unfortunately.

The investigation has to conclude before fines can be issued, due process and all that. Fines are also capped by law, which congress would have to change.

Deliberately missing the point, I see. Ohio seems to think it can handle it on its own. The relevant DotT and EPA people were on site within hours, but no the exec branch can't invade a state just because it wants to respond to a crisis.

I realize the exec branch can't "invade" just because they want to respond in a crisis. That's why governors have to declare an emergency and call for help from FEMA when there's a flood or forest fire.
Don't be surprised. There's no such thing as the news today. It's all parasitic mass media companies creating stretched truths to scare everyone in to clicking.
So Putin will convince them to join the war, a large chunk of their male population will be killed, and then there will be no one to start a resistance when Russia takes Belarus.

Yeah i give then a 25 % chance invading ukraine, a 25% chance joining ukraine and foght russia and a 90 % chance to kill Lukaschenko... (i know more than 100% but they can still fight russia afterwards).

Belarus is a semi-puppet state of Russia, with the unpopular dictator Lukashenko being kept in power by Russians military might. As a Russian puppet state, Russians keeps publicly trying to get Belarus to send their troops into Ukraine, but that would be extremely unpopular to the Belarusian population. So Lukashenko keeps making anti-Ukraine and anti-NATO noises to placate Putin, while at the same time doing everything he can to find and loudly talk about excuses to not actually send their troops into Ukraine.
Not to be a cynical bastard, but Trump threatening to split the R vote by running again might actually get the GOP to come around to the idea of throwing his ass in jail.
I dunno, if Trump goes to jail it's going to be because the GOP stopped protecting him, and he's going to point to that and tell his voters not to vote for Republicans anymore.

For sure, we all want him to be indicted too, but the way things are right now, Trump would be poison to Republicans 2024 chances. Pragmatically, a 2024 primary with Trump and DeSantis is more likely to end up with a Dem win than DeSantis running mostly unopposed.

DeSantis is considered trumps only potential gop rival, but he still only has like 20% of Republicans on board, vs trumps 70+%.

Why on earth would you imagine he wouldn't win the gop primary? They're pretending to be mad at trump for their flop of a midterm, but by the end of the week they'll be back.

Thank you. I'm tired of the bs narrative that trump only decided to run because Obama roasted him to ashes at the press dinner. Trump had run before, and had been talking publicly about wanting to run since the 80s.
Stuff does have an effect at almost any dosage, certainly any dose you can feel, and it is addictive. As someone who drank socially for years and years I didn't really want this to be true, but it is.
He gave the excuse that he didn't want the drink to control him. So to not make the drink control him he was going to show he could drink it without being addicted. Yet that weird circle idea is clearly him trying to justify his reason to keep on drinking without acknowledging it's an addiction.

I'm dealing with a friend who's an alcoholic. He was just living with his abusive parents for so long and did all sort of drugs to cope and wasn't doing anything with his life. I took him in as a last resort for his life. He's still at the stage of denying that a drink here and there is bad, even though that drink or 2 is done alone in his room.

It's tough. But I hope I can get him through. I know I'm going to have to deal with a lot, probably will start hiding it now that I confronted him.

It really isn't. Tons of studies have been done on people that just have a few drinks a day. Still come up short in negative deficits compared to a control groups.
Idk, he might have lost the support of the crazier GOP people in the state and, therefore, might not have had the support of the MA GOP. That combined with people who were unwilling to vote Republican on principle this time around, but did before, I think he would've lost a close race.
Take some solace in the fact that some of those races were only close because of gerrymandering and voter suppression. Although that’s something to be sad about for different reasons.

That's so sad and hurtful. To have someone you thought was your friend shit talk you in public now and pretend like you were never friends in the first place. From her friend's perspective, that must really sting :/.

McCain was a traditional republican who held many terrible views/opinions. But, we have to give credit where credit is due. He saved the ACA and stood up against the racism that he saw creeping in.

I remember that thumbs down...you could see the senators in the room holding their breath, and Chuck Schumer getting others to watch McCain because he knew.
This is great. Unfortunate that they didn't consult a teacher to make the board realistic though. Kind of plays into the stereotype of them being easily replaceable and not Professionals.
Didn't realize constructive criticism was so controversial. The other argument is that 'It's a cartoon'.

The audience for political cartoons is largely people who attended school when blackboards were still common, and so it's relatable to those readers even if it's a little anachronistic. It fits those people's mental image of what a normal classroom looks like. I'm not that old and we used blackboards. There are probably schools that still have blackboards.

Blackboards are less common but still used. Also, a speech bubble overlapping onto a whiteboard would be two sets of black text on white background, but the reader is only supposed to pay attention to one of them. Just visually confusing and ugly.
Many black citizens were stripped of south african citizenshio during apartheid, with their citizenships transferred to non internstionally recognised 'Bantustans' in formerly South African areas. This was done through the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970.
This allowed the apartheid government to claim many African South Africans were not, in fact, citizens.

Huh, I didn't realize that the Army has switched their standard piston engine vehicles over to JP-8. Although with more reading it sounds like a program that has been problematic. Would be interesting to hear from somebody who deployed recently about what fuels are actually being used, as opposed to the aspirational goals of the single fuel program.
All the logistics trucks, Humvees, Strykers, Bradleys, etc run on diesel. The Army transports plenty of diesel and could use it for the Abrams. They use JP-8 because it gives better performance, not because of logistics. That being said, Ukraine could absolutely run Abrams on diesel without a problem.

The US Army does other operators of the Abrams use diesel though. And to my knowledge for the first couple of years the US Army did too. Using JP-8 seems to be mainly done for logistical reasons. If you use the same fuel for your jets and everything else it means you only have to supply one type of fuel to your bases.

Some of the issues they had during the 00's were the base fuels being out of spec - easy for a turbine to deal with, less so for a piston engine.

They switched over in the 1990s, and there were teething issues that have been ironed out - namely the lack of lubrication for the fuel pumps when using JP5/8.

Let's be clear: Turkey is using the Quran burning as a cynical excuse to block Sweden's NATO bid, mostly because Sweden wouldn't play ball with Erdogan's effort to get Sweden to hand over Turkish political dissidents in Sweden.

I find some irony that Turkey is basically saying that until such time as Sweden curtails the freedoms of their citizens and becomes a much more oppressive government with strong censorship, Turkey will not support their involvement in international relations.
First: We did resist. Since the start of the war and throughout 2022, the police in Russia arrested almost 20,000 opponents of the war. According to human rights groups, protests have taken place almost every day in different cities since February 24, 2022, and only 18 of those days have passed without arrests and detentions. Against this background, we have seen astonishing examples of civil courage. For instance, Vladimir Rumyantsev, a provincial fireman, got three years in prison for building a ham radio to broadcast reports against the war, while Alexei Gorinov, a member of the Moscow city council, got seven years after he called for a minute of silence during a meeting of that chamber to honor the Ukrainian children who had been killed.
Not even to mention my favorite musician Yuri Shevchuk who publicly condemned the war and Putin, and his pretty big audience applaud to him and still quotes his phrase: "The motherland, my friends, is not the president’s ass that has to be slobbered and kissed all the time".

I want to appeal to the wisdom of the international community. Do not demean the Russians, as that kind of rhetoric will only strenhen Putin’s power. By shifting the blame for war crimes from the Kremlin junta onto my fellow citizens, you are easing the Putin regime’s moral and political burden. You are giving him a chance to hide from the just accusations of people who have in essence become a human shield in this situation. I see that as a serious mistake.

I'm afraid you are missing the point. If any free state did a 180⁰ turn and invaded a neighbour, the people of said state wouldn't have it. Instead ask yourself if you would come to Russia and speak out. Of course, you have no idea how many people would come with you. That's always a problem. And what would it change, you might ask yourself. They will just throw me in jail. Besides, it is not your country, let someone else do it. And so on and so forth.
It's disingenuous to say that Reagan was just an actor. He had been involved in California politics for decades, and he was governor of California for 8 years. During those eight years, he raised taxes, turned the state budget from a deficit to a surplus and helped implement a lot of the policies that made Cali a successful liberal state today.
Once he got to DC, he got sucked into the Nixonian miasma that the late-70's GOP had become. Reagan was a bad president, but the factors that made him a bad president were institutional rather than something inherent to him.

In fact, the article's timeline is incorrect. Using the Reagan administration as the starting point for the GOP's degradation is totally wrong. That really started with Nixon, and it was the result of decades of terrible foreign policy decisions.

Nixon history is wiped out by Watergate but it was much worse. He won, largely because he promised to win the Vietnam War. Peace with honor. Sounds good, right? Instead he sabotaged LBJ peace talks.

Completely untrue. TV was limited, people didn't have cable. Our "big screen" was a 12 inch black& white tv! Two channels and one was terrible because of bad reception. TV towers just didn't have anything close to the reception they have now. We definitely didn't watch tv much. It was a special treat. Do you really believe the nonsense that everyone was glued to the tv? Sheesh. Maybe it was true on the completely fictional tv channels you watched lol.

CSGO had a huge upswell some years ago and CS is doing fine as an esport, better than ever as an actual game in terms of technical aspects and balance. Lots of issues have been fixed and as it stands today, it's an excellent game with a very active community. So no sadness.
This is so sad. Ukrainians don't want to slaughter their brothers from across the border, but they are fighting for their lives. And Putin just keeps sending these kids to their deaths.

Never forget that these deaths are on Russia's hands and on the hands of the Putin regime. Every mother and father being told their child will never come home is a tragedy, no matter which language they speak, and it could be ended as easily as the stroke of a pen but for the arrogance of a man who has yet to realise that he's finally in over his head.

Never forget that these Russian soldiers need not have died were it not for the selfishness of the Russian commanders and Tsar Nikolai II Putin. His desire for legacy and a propaganda victory over a former SSR led him and his corrupt little henchmen to declare war against a sovereign nation simply because it wasn't doing everything Putin wanted. And now, with Belarus not also doing _everything_ Putin wants, he may seek to declare war on his own ally.

Russia's screaming about "we are fighting NATO!" without ever making a move on Poland, for example, also belies their claim to Great Power status. The only victory they can hope for, anymore, is an internal propaganda victory. Depressingly enough, it's working: hypernormalisation in effect, one supposes.
Put a microphone in John Robert’s face and ask _him_ this question. Lead it with, “you say that you are concerned about the perceived legitimacy of the a Supreme Court, yet a justice, whose spouse has alleged involvement in some cases, is ruling on those same cases….”.
And that’s the question: “Chief Justice, do you believe the court has a responsibility to recuse others of cases if they do not recuse themselves or do you believe justices should be granted the ability to judge their own behavior?”.

The line of thinking shows that we are in a constitutional crisis and really there’s nothing that if Ginni was say arrested right now that would stop Clarence from voting for her to be freed and this topic might mean that if there’s a constitutional crisis, the judges are above the law.

He won’t do it though cause he will give up his own power to do so—what he should do is step down if Clarence doesn’t and Biden appoints a new Justice and those justices would then be in a 5-4 split except there’s a better chance of a 8-0 vote to push Thomas off the board.

Just have Roberts make the choice to give up Thomas by accepting term limits and allow him to appoint a judge as a compromise with Biden (a type like Merrick) and there won’t be a civil war where the legal system is in shambles.
It’s also probably good to remember it took the GOP, what, 50 years to get us here. Three election cycles is a tiny fraction of that.
But the Republican votes are becoming more prevalent, not less. this election more repubs voted then Dems. How do you square that with them dying? Esp in the Midwest, repubs turned out in record numbers. I've been saying they're going to die out for the last 30 years but this is the worst I've seen in my 40something years where repubs turned out as much as they did.

More Republicans voted this last midterm than Dems did. Some of the Dems won by such a small lead, it was almost non-existent. People are still voting for Republicans in huge numbers. It seems like more and more people are turning Republican. It's scary. For the first time in a long time gallup has more registered Republicans than Democrats and less independents than ever.
I don’t usually care for the nationalism behind sports, but god I hope the US kicks the hell out of Iran in today’s match. I know the Iranian players are already getting threatened by government for their mild protest but you know that the government will gain something from this if they win.
It's not like Iran was invaded and conquered by a foreign power which then started doing these things; a sizeable percentage of the population probably either agrees with the government's actions, or doesn't care.

Yes. Religion on its own does nothing. It's always some jerk somewhere that uses it for their power grab. Plenty of aethists that commit brutality as well. More of a faulty human issue than anything else.

Nah. Just people using religion as a way of gaining power and controlling people. You can easily replace religion with "x" and it will be just as evil.
He serves a purpose. He is an opiate for a very rowdy subset of Russians(hard-liners) and additionally sows confusion and fear(though this doesn't land like they think it does) by letting the west hear his speeches as well.
While generally you're right, Russian government uselessly threatened a lot, there was a shift recently, it's no longer a colonial war done with expedition force of regular military, there's more and more push in the media that it's a serious all out war, including Putin's . Putin would have preferred not to do anything, there were indications that he might try another big push, which is why Ukraine asked for heavy weaponry quicker, etc.

Im looking forward to seeing what Russia can muster at this point, but the war will definitely be on "a new level", but not in Russias favor. Let's give Ukrainians all the weapons they ask for, tanks, jets, ASAP and let's end this war before Russia drags the rest of the world into their terror regime.

We just need to give Ukraine better weapons b/c this is a war of attrition and Putin does not care how many of his troops die - so we need to help Ukraine do a better job of killing them efficiently - preferably well behind the front lines.

Putin's desire to do another big offensive is due to the fact that western countries are relatively slow to give new types of weapons to Ukraine (like current conversations about Leopard tanks), so the faster he attacks, less time Ukraine and its allies have to arm the military.

Putin might need some kind of victory to justify the war, although an ongoing war without changes is also very beneficial - allows him to do whatever he wants inside the country, because everything can be explained away by the needs of the war. But it's only if he can guarantee that the situation won't change, and with Ukraine getting more and more weapons it might, even if it will take half a year to a year.
Moat states technically aren't done all together for a week or so after the votes are cast, you just get results early in chunks, and conclusions can be drawn with enough of those chunks.

so if dems get AZ and NV, and the gop gets GA, won't it be 50/50 and then harris is the deciding vote in a tie, giving them basically a majority in the chamber?

There is a good argument to be made that if dems get AZ and NV then GA will follow suit because a major motivating factor in the GA race for Republicans is senate control. With that gone a lot of people will probably stay home instead of voting for Walker. Which clearly they didn’t want to do if you look at how well Kemp preformed vs Walker.

With Kemp not on the ballot, Walker was already going to struggle in the runoff. Hopefully Warnock will have even better odds now if the Dems pull it off in AZ & NV.
Agreed. Mueller said he was guilty but he used limp dick wording: “If we believed the president did not commit a crime, we would have said so," allowing his old pal Barr to bury it with a bullshit memo.
Trump is a Russian traitor attempting to burn the Law of the DOJ and our Constitution. Others pretend he is innocent. That is why we should have had the ability to weigh the evidence in our court of Law.

Mueller was appointed by deputy attorney general rod rosenstien. The only reason they used a special counsel is because they didn’t trust trump after he fire James Comey.

why would any of these terror groups want to hurt israel or the israeli ppl if they have well functioning society, a good life, work, etc.if israel invested money in the new palestinian state, built universities and schools, let them come work in israel and vice versa, invested in businesses there and mingled their economies together, how, and why, would anyone want the other's downfall.

Out of curiosity, how do you think Israel could disengage from the West Bank and Gaza without also empowering the militant groups funded by foreign nations which reside there?

Even if Israel operated in complete good faith with the disengagement (I know, already dubious), these militant groups are funded by foreign nations and organizations which don’t seem to care as much about the Palestinian people as much as harming Israel. How would such disengagement be different when they left Gaza, which only seemed to empower right wing xenophobic groups on both sides?

israelis have a tendency to completely ignore what we are doing in the west bank and gaza as if its some other worldly place that just doesnt count? no matter what excuses u wanna give yourself for the reason we keep doing it, we still DO IT, we choose to do that, and we dont have to.
Also, "the West" is not a single person to hold accountable. As far as I know, no one here destabilized any Latin American country, so it isn't hipocritical for anyone to criticize Russia here.
No, US intervention in foreign countries is not ok. But when you see an article about someone being murdered, you do not answer with "well what about this other murder that happened the other day, was that okay???".

Whataboutism is not a valid argument. Also, there are multiple independent left-wing south american nations right now. Please name a eastern european country russia hasn't tried to destabilize.

That is a classic propaganda technique used by the Russians and you shouldn't fall for it nor employ it.

This also reeks of Putinism, because it implies that the USA is always choosing new enemies...at the very time when it is little Vladolf Shitler (you know the OP topic) who invaded a peaceful sovereign nation (AGAIN) after violating a decades old peace accord, installing his own puppet as president, and trying to launch an internal civil war with his own planted stooges in Eastern Ukraine.

edit - 1931 was the great depression and the deaths are mostly tied to sickness from what I could find. This was also prior to the 20th amendment, so it was 13 months between election day and the start of the new congress. These are the 14 that died in that 13 month period.

Just thought I make this a top level comment for anyone interested. Someone had asked when the last time (if ever) a majority party selected a speaker from the minority party.

Until a Speaker is selected by obtaining a majority vote, the House cannot conduct any other business. This includes swearing in new members of Congress, selecting members for House committees, paying Committee staff, & adopting a rules package.
was arrested within four days of the FBI finding out about her leaking a single classified document. She was charged within nine days. And sat in jail without bail for over a year until her sentencing.
Also, if you're so worried about political optics, striking while the iron is hot, and while there is outrage, is a great way to have good optics.

Start arresting them. If we don’t move on this soon, they’ll try it again next election, and that may well be the last fairly democratic election America ever has.

Perhaps if the GOP had a candidate for president that wasn’t a complete moron that put the country first and not himself they may have had a chance to win the election . Fortunately the voters said four years of this low life was more than enough.
Ahh but the problem with this is in America we have the two parties. And the two parties decide the choices here in many cases. People in CA chose to re-elect Feinstein each time because she is the only option the party give them for that seat if they want a Democrat each election. There might be some token opposition in a primary but you know the party is going to throw their support behind the incumbent.
There needs to be more pressure on the parties to force aging politicians to step aside and let someone else run when it become obvious they are getting too old to keep up with the demands of the job.

I do think many politicians today are too old, especially when you compare heads of state like Justin Trudeau and Macron to Biden however it's the responsibility of the people to vote for people who represent them. And if people choose these geriatric people to represent them they have to live with that decision.

Though it is also unfortunate that we have political parties that push to essentially pick who even shows up on a ballot or gets elected but it is what it is.
Somebody who grew up in a different culture will have all aspects of their life colored by the culture they grew up in. What they eat, how they communicate, what religion they follow, etc.
That doesn't mean they don't deserve respect or that their views are less valuable. But those differences are there, and a truly multicultural community will embrace and learn from those differences.

I expect people to learn the language, socialize outside of their homogenous groups and accept local laws and ethics. Locals don’t need to do shit, it’s immigrants who need to be active.

It is deliberate, because it's financially rewarding for them to intentionally murder people and short sell them on power on purpose. Texas is everything the right complains is wrong with government and they keep asking for more of it.
Willfully underbuilding the infrastructure in Texas was very financially rewarding for the utility companies. This belief that companies will act in good faith when the incentive structure is built for just the opposite baffles me.

Progress from mass murder for profit to a reliable grid like a developed nation should already have isn't "progress". That's meeting the bare minimum after a bit of pushback in response to ghoulish levels of capitalism.

To be genuinely honest, it's actually capitalism working exactly as intended; deception is part of the model. It was literally the answer to the question "if divine right goes out of fashion, are economic exploitation and military violence sufficient to maintain power?".

The direct quote. There's times it's appropriate to acknowledge human nature, that people can be good or bad, say if there is value in a good policy a politician made (I would use Trump as an example but I struggle to find anything he did well, operation warp speed?). But when it is "People call you Hitler but you aren't bad right?" and the answer is "ackshually"... there is a problem. Sure, technically not everythign Hitler did was evil, especially if you were a white German there were probably plenty of good benefits, but that's not at all relevant in talking about race and genocide and racists use it as a way to try and dilute the argument against racism and to humanize Hitler. Kanye is already awful but even moreso making this argument.
The rest of Kanye’s rant is even crazier than what’s quoted here. Kanye tried to credit Hitler for creating highways and the microphone as examples of the good Hitler has also done.

That's who Hitler was, and Kanye likes him. There is no horror movie ever made that comes close to describing what Hitler did, and Kanye likes him.

Now he’s saying “No, I like Hitler…” and they’re like “Oh… that’s what he meant.” Yeah no fucking shit that’s what he meant.

I don’t know where he got the idea that Hitler created the microphone, but I suppose he just got confused about the fact that Hitler used a microphone during his hate-filled rants? Close enough, I suppose.

When people like Kanye make claims along these lines, they completely ignore historical context. Everything the Nazis touched withered and died. You can’t even give Hitler credit for loving his dog, Blondi, because the lunatic decided to test his cyanide capsules on the poor dog to make sure they worked and ordered her puppies to be taken outside and shot after his suicide.
The Chinese balloon from last week is something different, even if these things also turn out to be Chinese.
There's no confirmation of what objects have been observed today, but authorities were careful to call yesterday's shoot down "an object" and stated it definitely wasn't a balloon.

Today, just scrolling news, I’ve found that bird flu has killed seals in my country, a haemmoragic fever that is killing people in a matter of hours has 200 people quarantined in Guinea and these "objects" that are being shot down, as well as over 20.000 dead so far in Turkey and Syria and Ukraine taking out a Russian Terminator tank.

I also blame Putins nuclear threats for some of it as now it seems that it will be a case of "the boy who cried wolf" when it comes to trusting what is actually a credible threat until it proves that it is.

Agreed. I guess Brazil still trips me up though because there’s no real reason for them not to take a stronger stance either. One Brazilian told me they couldn’t “risk trade being impacted with Russia”, but I don’t buy that given that 81% of Brazil’s trade is done with 25 nations, and Russia isn’t one of those. At best Russian goods constitute less than .8% of Brazil’s trade. And for countries that constantly deride colonialism and imperialism and the evils of it and how all of their problems are because of colonial invasions and imperialist meddling, it just strikes me that a literal imperialist nation invading a small, weaker one purely as a land grab is casted as “not our problem” or “a European issue”. Like how would any of these countries feel if they got invaded by the US or China and Europe/the US/the rest of the world said “that’s a Latin American problem”.

I’m not asking Brazil to go to war with Russia, or to even supply military aid. But at the very least, maybe your president shouldn’t be blaming Zelensky and refusing to so much as acknowledge that what Russia is doing is wrong. And sorry but I don’t think, even if they were your enemy, Russia is going to be crossing the earth to invade Brazil. But to answer your question, if they did, you can bet your ass the US would be fighting Russia and/or China if they tried invading a country in the western hemisphere. The US might not get involved with a border skirmish between your country and Venezuela, but if Russia tried to shit there I hope you know we’d be jumping at the excuse to kick their asses, regardless of your NATO status.

Then you threaten their licence. Ultimately, BP need to be able to extract oil in order to sell it. If one oil company is offering to play ball (and they will if they get preferential treatment) then you have leverage.
If supply reduces people pay more money for oil, this results in the company having more money for investment. Or they pay money to share holders in dividends which drives the stock price up. The stock price going up means the company can create new shares and sell them while only reducing the stock value slightly. This money can be invested into its ability to expand supply. So more oil well exploration which can drive the price down in the future. If this doesn’t happen then the supply does not increase and oil price remains high which increases the cost of goods. Even if the government does a windfall tax that serves to reduce the amount of investment in oil, which may not be a bad thing because it makes Green energy more viable. The problem with doing that in the short term is that people end up unable to afford to heat their homes until you have the technology for heating reliably with green energy. You can subsidise heating costs but this makes factories have to pay more for energy which increases the price of products that consumers buy. You can set price caps but then you need to decide who gets to buy oil and who doesn’t because price isn’t the determining factor. You can increase interest rates which makes it more expensive to get debt which sends unprofitable companies into bankruptcy, reduces demand for labour which further reduces the money in the economy causing demand destruction. That does lower the price of oil but it causes financial hardship.

Or you could do nothing. The oil companies will make a killing and they will increase their supply over time while we work on replacing our energy supply with fossil fuels.
Considering narcotics history in warfare I wouldn't be surprised if it's more than alcohol, alcohol can be used for stuff like this, but it's much less reliably effective than say amphetamines which is what the nazis used.
Of course, as I said in another comment I wasnt intending to say that the allies or any of the other participants didn't use them, just that there is a ton of notes about the nazis drug cocktail being important to their initial speed.

Absolutely, didn't mean to imply that only nazis used it, they are just a prime example of drug cocktails for soldiers. There are some historians that attribute the blitzkriegs speed to that drug cocktail, hence my focus on them.

I was going to say, drug use has been rampant in war for millennia, on pretty much all fronts. To this day, US SF are still issued what's essentially Adderall but with some special modifications. How do you think they stay awake for 3-4 days at a time?

It's apparently something classified that isn't technically amphetamines but has the same effect. They take pills that they aren't legally allowed to talk about.
I think the ability for the Japanese to coordinate with South Korea and Taiwan is more what the recent developments are about anyway.
While Japans's general increased military buildup is no doubt a response to China, I suspect this particular purchase has more to do with North Korea . Tomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles. If you want something to actually not get intercepted by a near-pear you'd probably want supersonic ballistic missiles.

Unless these are the latest Block V which make up for being a sub-sonic cruise missile by being more stealthy, I suspect it's more so the US getting rid of their older inventory since the US is retiring a lot of their older Tomahawks currently.

US are using block V tomahawks and after that they're likely to retire tomahawk missiles altogether. Not to mention a lot of current US missile destroyers are coming up to decommissioning age and their missiles aren't likely to be installed in the next gen destroyers and frigates.

What I'm concerned about is that Tomahawk missiles are actually pretty old, but still expensive to build (powered by a jet engine), and relatively easy to shoot down with modern anti aircraft weaponry (large radar and IR signature, and relatively slow).

I hate that we're still treating elections like a football game. The score predictions, the talk of hail maries. This shit is not a game. We are at the actual, no-joke, precipice of fascism. And there's nowhere to run off to. A Republican-controlled US that is aligned with Russia will absolutely change the entire world order for the worst. Israel is back with Netanyahu. Brazil barely scraped by. Orban keeps consolidating power. Italy elected an actual neofascist as president. Global democracy is on its way out, and a GOP takeover will snuff the flame for at least a generation.
Yep, we are at the end of the road when you have people running for office saying things like they'll never let the GOP lose if they're elected. Well, that's not really good for democracy, is it?

In the final weeks of the race, Rudy Giuliani ignited a media campaign alleging that the computer’s hard drive contained e-mails and pictures of Hunter Biden that compromised his father. Guo has denied involvement in disseminating disinformation about the laptop, but leaked messages suggest that he coördinated his followers to edit images and to spread the story. Three days before the election, Bannon met with Guo’s supporters and applauded their “editorial creativity over the pictures,” according to a recording provided to Mother Jones. Bannon said that the laptop story stalled Biden’s momentum and “drove up his negatives,” which kept the race close enough that Trump could declare victory, whether or not he went on to win. “That’s our strategy,” Bannon told them. “So, when you wake up Wednesday morning, it’s going to be a firestorm.”.

The Trump campaign had heard of the laptop during the summer, when a man from Delaware reached out to say that it had been abandoned at his repair shop. The first known public mention of it came on September 25th, from a guest on the YouTube channel of Wang Dinggang, one of Guo’s collaborators. The guest claimed that explicit material on the laptop was “recorded by the C.C.P.” and had “arrived mysteriously in America” to provide the Party with leverage over Joe Biden as he ran for President. Some of Guo’s allies followed up by creating and spreading fabricated images, according to Jack Maxey, a former co-host of Bannon’s podcast. “It was a huge deflection from reality,” Maxey recalled. “I said to Steve on Day One, ‘This is a bad idea.’ ” But, he added, “I can’t tell Steve what to do. Apparently, Miles can.”.

Gerrymandering and voter suppression was taking too long for the impatient GOP party; now they're just admitting they're going to steal, or deny, all future elections. Which truly means it's time for some sort of split in America. The GOP and sane, decent, mindful, empathetic Americans cannot exist under the same flag, rules, or laws.
I thought about that when I typed it and was thinking "I wonder if flee is spelled differently than flee." It certainly felt wrong when I typed it. But somehow appropriate for this guy so I left it.
Depends on what losing means. For Ukraine to get its post war borders back + Crimmea might mean Putin gets ousted. But even then I don't think this guy gets extradited to Europe unless Russia's new administration is super friendly with NATO which I don't see happening. I just see relations warming slightly and the war ending. Not that they'll suddenly ship this guy or Snowden or anybody like that to NATO.

I don’t think Russia is going to nuke Ukraine, but they can. The threat of war with NATO holds them back, but having as many nukes as they do means they can do stupid crap with them and still have many left to use.

The reason the Russians failed miserably is because there was no longer an interest for conventional warfare after the coming of nukes. It was considered a waste of time and open for pillaging the army, because they had nukes.

Then the bluff doesn’t come from whether their arsenal works, it comes from the MAD doctrine and the unwillingness to start nuclear holocaust. Which is my point.

I think that's the point. If they are fucked by losing this war, why not take the rest of us with them? I mean, people say that would be stupid since russians would die too, but what makes people think they care about russians?
So there is evidence she groomed and had sex with them, but the GOP protected her by essentially saying "she only had sex with them a little, so you shouldn't punish. Instead, let her run for office again.".
Yep. To them a social worker must be doing it for the money but explain that they don't make much and they will pivot to something like they only do it because they can't get better jobs or they must have another, bad, motivation.

My sister believes this all to often. She is a liberal (I'm far left ideologically compared to her) but her and her husband work a lot. A lot of people have their heads in the sand. They think it can't be true because the GOP is hiding behind the absurd... Tell me has there ever been a politician that could have mocked a disabled person live on tv and still get elected? Not since before civil rights. Clinton was impeached for lying about a blow job and whale mocked endlessly for misspelling potato.

Use differences in the Christian sects against each other. Force them to say that the rules and beliefs of all their different sects are equal.... They can't all be right...
"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.".
Oh yeah. So, we should actively protest gun shows. We should punish businesses that carry guns, or allow gun owners to do business there. We should target schools that have guns mentioned in their criteria and ban that. We should refer to gun owners as dangers to our children. Maybe start calling them groomers. We should absolutely make kids show if there are guns in their house before they can play in sports. We should try and limit services to gun owners on religious grounds. Let's bully gun owners until they are forced to commit suicide. And while we're at it, let's have national level discussions on which bathrooms gun owners can use.

And even Portland itself, which has long been a posterchild example of a liberal urban hellhole among conservatives has gun shows pretty often. Well advertised, and get a good showing when they are in town.

Like most conservative culture war bullshit, there is very little (if any) nuance or even caring to understand the people being hurt by it.

And that is despite the fact that there are daily instances of guns being used to kill people. How may have died as a direct result of drag shows?
That’s very true. I wasn’t even aware of that until a few months ago. China nation-building in Africa was just not something I’d’ve presumed to happen.
Yeah, and Japan will remilitarize. A weakened Russia, allied with China, North Korea, and perhaps a handful of middle eastern entities will not do well against the rest of the world…but nuclear deployment by last resort (which thankfully hasn’t happened with Russia yet) is something scary to consider.

Russia’s flailing has clarified many things, not the least among them being that if you’re not suicidal enough to use nuclear weapons, the West doesn’t have time for your bollocks. There’s no economy or political system around, China included, that compares to the US’ investment in military might.

The US has also been able to interlace its economic dominance with its global logistical superiority by spending in such a way that many of its own allies pull back on their own military spending as a result. I cannot overstate this, the idea of your external influence being so significant it causes you to curtail your own external investment is baffling. The existence of the US military literally causes other countries to invest less in their own defense.

The reason this is so important to the hegeonomy of a nation is in its ability to protect export assets. It's a super weird conversation that very rarely comes up in the discussion of modern global economics because the security of assets is almost universally guaranteed. That wasn't always the case though.

Russia's actions in Ukraine actually handed the US another 50+ years of total global hegemony and it's absolutely idiotic that they couldn't foresee what they were doing. They've shifted energy policy in Europe virtually overnight, and it's done nothing but reinforce how far ahead of the game the US really is in military infrastructure. Specifically, military logistics of all things. The US does military logistics in a way that is eons ahead of anyone else on the planet, and that must make China anxious if it ever has real aspirations to take Taiwan. It's not happening in the next decade at least. Russia just gifted the US another decade of complete global domain.

Aside from maybe France, there are very few military developers that are even a degree of magnitude in alignment with the likes of Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, Textron, Northrup, United, GD, etc.
If I was 71 and had been embarrassed because I visibly wet myself in front of everyone I would still publicly shame this pathetic piece of shit, the President of South Sudan, for pissing himself in front of the whole world.
If you had asked me about South Sudan’s president 5 minutes ago I woulda had nuthin for ya, but if you ask me now I’d be like ya I saw him piss himself.

You know, I didn't even know or care about Salva Kiir peeing his pants like a little boy, but now that he's being a little bitch about it, I have learned that Salva Kiir, the president of South Sudan, has peed his pants in public.

From now on, every time I hear the name Salva Kiir, I remember that he is a little boy that pees his pants in public and then throws a temper tantrum against free journalism. Maybe Salva Kiir should consider wearing a diaper next time he drags his incontinent ass out of the nursing home.

His name is Salva Kiir and appearantly he's also a cruel dictator. So make sure you associate the name Salva Kiir with incontinent old people next time you hear it.
Reduction, save money on not importing foreign made vaccines, save money all around by eliminating the greatest burdens on the system.
In China, as elsewhere, vaccination is the best tool for reducing mortality. Three shots of a Chinese vaccine provide reasonable protection against severe illness and death. But, as of late November, only 40% of those aged over 80 had received three shots. Some were jabbed so long ago that the effectiveness of the vaccine will be wearing off. As cases surged in early December, China stepped up its efforts. The average number of doses administered went up from under 1m per day to over 3m on December 21st. But since then the campaign appears to have slowed again. More effective foreign vaccines are still banned.

Most of China’s population has never been exposed to covid and many old people are undervaccinated. So while the Omicron variant of the virus will cause relatively mild symptoms in most people, a large number of Chinese are still vulnerable to severe illness. The country’s weak health-care system is already under huge pressure. At a hospital in Beijing your correspondent saw elderly patients breathing from oxygen tanks on gurneys that spilled out into packed corridors and waiting rooms. Videos circulating online show similar scenes across China. There have been reports of patients being turned away from hospitals in smaller cities owing to a lack of beds. Officials say there are around 10 intensive-care unit (ICU) beds per 100,000 people in the country, well below what is needed. Medical staff are in short supply, too. A health official has warned that some regions are approaching the “critical point” in ICU-bed supply.

But a hint of how poorly things are going can be detected in the actions of China’s supreme leader, Xi Jinping. When the virus was under control, Mr Xi was hailed as the “commander-in-chief” of the “people’s war” on covid. He spoke often about the need to persevere with zero-covid. Since cases began to surge, though, he has remained largely quiet, making only oblique references to the outbreak. On December 26th he said the country’s “epidemic prevention and control faces new circumstances and new tasks”. That is something of an understatement.

Drugs used to treat covid are in high demand. Many pharmacies have run out of fever medicine and painkillers. Paxlovid, an antiviral that helps prevent severe sickness, is especially sought after. Prices of the drug have surged; many hospitals are reportedly short of it. Some have sought unauthorised versions of Paxlovid sent in from abroad. Meanwhile, WeChat, a ubiquitous messaging app, has launched a function that tries to connect individuals in need of fever drugs and other supplies with those who have them.
"Just a month before his 20th birthday, Mr. Santos entered a small clothing store in the Brazilian city of Niterói outside Rio de Janeiro. He spent nearly $700 using a stolen checkbook and a false name, court records show.
Mr. Santos admitted the fraud to the shop owner in August 2009, writing on Orkut, a popular social media website in Brazil, “I know I screwed up, but I want to pay.” In 2010, he and his mother told the police that he had stolen the checkbook of a man his mother used to work for, and used it to make fraudulent purchases.".

yes. takes 2/3 of congress to expel him. After this, the Dems would retake the seat in a special election for sure, so the last thing McCarthy needs (assuming McCarthy gets a position where he cares, tomorrow), or anyone in the GOP, is to go from 222-213 down to 221-214. You go from 5 Republicans together needed to pull a "Manchin" to 4.

I've known a few people who are much like this guy, compulsive liars - will say anything without regard for truth or even simple consistency, just to make themselves seem important; they rely on most people either not caring, being too polite to call them out, or not being interested enough to remember earlier details. If they are called out, they find a way to say "Did I say X? What I really meant was Y, which is sort of X" - much like Santos' explanation that he meant he was Jew-"ish" (which apparently is still a lie).

I think the real interesting answer is what's coming financially. Supposedly he had a corporation, which apparently does not appear to have done any real business, that suddenly was able to pay him enough that he could (allegedly) lend his campaign $700,000 of money he received from his corporation. If this was simply a dodge to get around campaign limit finance laws, then he and whoever gave him the money are both guilty. Not to mention any interesting shenanigans the IRS might be interested in.
He set the withdrawal up to fail and then his entire administration actively refused to fully participate in the presidential transition of power.
Ended what mess? He locked the Afghanistan government out of the withdrawal talks with the Taliban, let Taliban prisoners out, and then withdrew all but a relative handful of US forces.

Trump's main point in his surrender with the Taliban was that he would be removing troops. Not bringing more in. Biden would have been in breach of the agreement if he brought in any additional troops to assist with the exit of the country.

Trump agreed to release 5,000 prisoners/terrorists, agreed to leave the country, agreed to not attack the Taliban, agreed to not do anything about the Taliban taking over the country, and agreed to make this deal without the Afghan government we had put in power.

And negotiated with the Taliban without including the actual Afghan government and released 5000 Taliban fighters as part of the deal. It's not like he did everything he could to fuck it up and commit the next administration to a timeline that wasn't wise or favorable.
A grand jury judge probably won’t make any statements, but grand jury members should not be talking before the Fulton County DA either announces charges or announces a declination. It seems like this special purpose grand jury member got baited by Trump’s, "total exoneration1" On the other hand, if no names are mentioned, then it’s less damaging to the prosecution than it could be otherwise.
Or she’s shrewd as hell and is working hard to create a slippery veneer of impartiality, knowing that as soon as indictments are released she and the entire grand jury will be personally attacked by the GOP.

BTW, there's also that woman 'Emily' who was on the Grand Jury who gave an interview to media, and her actions in this regard most likely have compromised the case to the point of destroying it.

Same as Poland then. Poland will send their 30-40 year old 2A4s instead of their modernized ones tho (the german ones are 2A6s, which is the version build in the 2000s).
If we actually end up sending 2A5s and up versions (and not just older 2A4s) in decent quantities then Russians will have all the reasons to be worried. These things are SCARY. Not just "a bit scary" either - Leopards have benchmarked best of all tanks by a significant margin.

If you want to get the best tanks that are available, you either buy the American M1 or the German Leopard 2. How good they are now exactly depends on the exact versions but they are generally the best of the best of a certain age bracket of tanks.

With a few nations sending stuff, Ukraine is getting 30 M1s and around 45-50 Leopard 2s or so. Some of those are the older Leopard 2A4 standard, which was up to date in the late 80s and some are the newer A6 standard from the late 90s/early 2000s.

Leopard 2A7A1 is the variant with the Trophy system. There are not enough of them to send as any upgrades to thst version at scale still lies a bit into the future.

Leopard 2A6, High end Abrams, Leclercs, Challengers and I guess K2 and possibly Japanese tanks are all roughly equivalent. They share a lot of tech and know-how, but do different trade-offs.
Honestly? Let them destroy the economy. They have yet to face any consequences for their shit cause dems keep bailing them out. It's not Democrats responsibility to stop these psychos. They're in charge in January. Force them to govern.
Force them to govern? These people don't believe in governing beyond tax breaks for rich people, so good luck with that.

But perhaps I'm naive, but I don't know if there is as much desire now to further cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy. Meaning less desire to cut the budget now. You've got corporations who may actually want the government to stimulate the economy instead of strangle it this time.

Republicans have a lot of campaign donors that don't want to see a repeat of 2011. Medicare lowering their payments to providers would directly hurt insurance and hospitals and I don't see Republicans wanting to upset them. Major defense contractors are in the same boat.

I suppose Republicans will have to weigh if pissing off some lobbyists is worth it in order to tank the economy and give them a better chance of taking back power. They did that last time probably because they had enough billionaires who wanted those savings from cutting the budget under Obama to go towards tax cuts for corporations.
This is my state, and it's been like this forever. Surprisingly, SC is not that red of a state. It's about 55/45 in statewide elections, and some of that is due to voter suppression and the fact that a lot of liberals find it pointless to vote because Dems never win anymore.
Democratic states keep pushing strict gun control, so the pendulum swings the other way in red states...This is entirely predictable.

Here’s my personal rule for whenever someone advocates replacing Joe Biden in 2024: you need to have a replacement candidate who can win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
As much as I would prefer someone other than Biden to run (and, preferably, someone further to the left than him), this seems counterproductive without a definable candidate to replace him.

Joe Biden has done an unimaginably better job as president, and as a leader in general, than Trump ever came close to. He is getting things done, making strides for equal justice, applying balm to the economy, and acting as a much better role model and statesman than anyone in the RepubliKKKan Party could even imagine of doing.

He’s old, but he’s also proven that that isn’t a barrier to being a good president. I hope for a younger pool of candidates in the future, but that’s only because I think even more progress than the good that Biden’s brought home could be accomplished with a relative whippersnapper of, say, early Obama’s age.

Yep. Half of the GOP want a nitwit who supposedly doesn't even control what goes on at his own home to be president while the other half will begrudgingly vote for him if he makes it to the general. They don't care what he'll do to the country as long as Republicans win.
You have the freedom to not do things that hurt conservatives' feelings, and the freedom to hurt non-conservatives however you may wish.

Mail every American a couple at random or even co-relate them to family military service and give them the right branch, and let them buy the other ones they want.
Because Ukraine lies since it benefits them and they've been doing it consistently ever since the war started, it's just the first time US isn't playing along.
The only Americans who want to disengage or pullback from supporting Ukraine are right to far right politicians/talking heads - don Jr recently tweeted something like, "now that we know the missile was Ukraine's can we please stop giving them billions of dollars?!” like the petulant moron that he is, and that's basically the sentiment from his side of the political spectrum, and they're not even close to any kind of majority opinion. The US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley has said multiple times that the US will continue to support Ukraine as best as it can for as long as it takes, and the majority agree with this.

I don't think it's the US looking to find a way to disengage; Biden just asked Congress for another emergency aid package for Ukraine 2 days ago, this time 37 billion. It might have been Ukraine's, zelenskyy has said they wouldn't deny that and would formally apologize, they just haven't seen the data that the US and Poland are looking at (at least at the time of that statement). US could be trying to de-escalate, I don't know, or it could really have been Ukraine's. It wouldn't change the fact that all parties still agree that Russia is ultimately responsible. And even still, it isn't as if Poland is being aggressive and demanding NATO boots on the ground (and neither is Ukraine for that matter). A call for article 5 would need to come from the country attacked, and Poland has only said they want to issue article 4, which is just a discussion involving all parties. I feel like every one here is being reasonable, given what info each party has at hand at any given time so far.
No matter how much packet analysis and systems probing you can never know for sure if it's truly encrypted, the data isnt still available in memory somewhere or intentionallytransmitted in secondary channels. Encrypting data doesnt guarantee all copies are in cyphertext. Saying that, if a single Twitter developer with proper access leaked dev code or db showing this kind of behavior they would instantly cause a true shitstorm, it's just not worth it and the likelihood is that Twitter is acting in its own interests which is to cater to free speech absolutists.
And if they manage to pull some kind of shenanigans that make it impossible to fully validate the encryption, maybe some kind of signed security module that only runs in the TCM without letting you see what's running on your own computer and sends packets you can't decode for yourself, then that means Twitter is untrustworthy even if you can't prove that it's sending your secrets to a third party. That would be just as big a red flag as if you caught it CCing Elon Musk personally.

The Signal protocol does end-to-end encryption. That means you don't have to trust the middleman, they could be the most evil and corrupt entities in the world and they still couldn't see your messages.

Likewise, it gets decrypted on your target's computer, which should be under his control and not Twitter's.

I expect that he's going to encrypt DMs between twitter and you and between twitter and your conversation partner. But I also expect them to retain the ability to read them at the server level. Keep in mind he said the Signal Protocol, which does not include the at-rest storage.
California has had this practice for years and it's helping to keep animal shelters from euthanizing many great pets.
The animals I encountered were from the humane society, and a shelter run by a local vet. Not to say it never happens, but I am very familiar with the shelters in my area, and they are absolutely not buying dogs.

In Ontario, Canada, this is what our pet stores do. any cats, dogs or rabbits you see come from a nearby shelter. You have to apply to the shelter to adopt. We also have a cat cafe (you can go and have a coffee and hang out with cats) which also works with a shelter and adopts animals out.

I got my cat from a pet store which worked with a local rescue/adoption agency to actually source their animals. I assume this law would allow for similar arrangements? So it's not even more difficult for prospective pet owners, from their perspective it's still "going to the pet store," the only change is that every animal adopted is a rescue.

This is a very good thing, for those who think it will make it more difficult to buy pets, yes, but only slightly which is a good thing. Breeders are still able to breed/sell their animals, those who really want them still have a fairly easy way to get them. This leads to slightly more thinking/planning and less impulse buying of animals who later end up in shelters. Not all things should be impulse buys, pets are with you for years and require constant attention. This will also help shelters, not only will less animals end up there, a lot of pet stores will partner with shelters to feature some of their animals to attract customers and drive adoptions.
This was a confessional seat near nyc. The Democratic Party failed in their oppo research and the local papers of record from the New York Times on down missed the boat.
Are dems supposed to expect republicans to do the right thing? We know they won’t. Some of them support straight up insurrectionists. The folks in charge of opo research for the area and the people in charge of the local party apparatus need to go if this is the level of competence.

I was hearing this for the weeks leading up to the election. NY was a shit show, NY could single-handedly flip the house. While most of the country disregarded the racist southern strategy flogging the issue of "inner city crime", that plus inflation made big inroads in NY.
Yep, Umbrella Man in Minneapolis springs to mind, and Boogaloo Bois were instrumental in starting the fire at the third precinct. Not the only perpetrators but I often wonder if that building would have ever burned like that if there were no white supremacists trying to start a race war present.
And pro-police conservatives conveniently ignore the fact that pretty much all the 2020 protests that became violent were because the police attacked them. Of course there were the legit riots, civil rights movements and riots often run parallel, for what should be obvious reasons, but if you see a video of people with signs involved in an altercation with police I guarantee the police attacked the crowd first.

All I'm saying is that I find it a little sus that the incident that sparks the most immediate outrage AND preemptive action from the Police Department itself (and other Law Enforcement Organizations) is the one involving all black people. Where the fuck has this energy been?? All of a sudden on this case the champions of "We investigated ourselves and found no wrong doing" found the error of their ways?? I'm just tired of this shit man. Hopefully this indeed is a turning point for our country and laws concerning police officers. But I ran out of hope 20yrs ago.
"Yes, we are building closed-loop ammunition production lines, jointly producing armored vehicles and MLRS and developing new high-tech weapons", – the message reads.
"Since the insurance covers everything from oil spills to collisions, Turkey essentially seeks to protect its waters, but it could also affect the flow of millions of barrels of crude oil exported from Russia,".

a key point in this angle on the background economic war the west is trying to wage is that sanctions will stop almost all of the insurers large enough to insure vessels carrying Russian oil from offering insurance. it will presumably raise prices of the discounted Russian oil, because shippers will not readily be able to find insurance. Janet yellen says it will raise the price significantly. we'll have to wait and see. I believe the insurance changes take effect December 5th.
Help them with their energy goals? I suggest you look into why that whole "death to the West" thing happened. The US and the UK shat the bed here. Pretty decent allies don't put a puppet in power to avoid a country nationalizing their oil.
It should give you a deeper understanding of the real history behind Iran's hatred of the US. Granted, that hate has been exploited and magnified by religious authorities to keep a tight grip on the country but it's founded on a very legitimate grievance.

In light of this, calling the US a decent ally of Iran in the past and attributing them any good intentions in their relationship is... a bit farfetched.

The funny (worst) part is, America had improving relations with Iran until Trump pulled us out of the nuclear deal. If that deal was still going, Russia wouldn't have any room to fill our role.

Russia isnt going to help them with jackshit. That allows Iran to leverage both sides because they know they are never under threat of being attacked.

Well if ruSSia proposed Iran niclear bomb than this would explain Iran willingness to send military help. Not sure if ruSSia can help to develop but they definitely can share.
Or you have Seattle that taxes sugared sodas, "juices" (not 100% juice) and teas but not milk-based products.
I think taxing soda's and other sugary drinks is a good idea. The rate of obesity has drastically increased over the years, and continues to increase. Sugar consumption cost the world over $150 billion in dental work. Over 73,000 amputations per year due to diabetes. Countries like Mexico and Argentina statistically drink soda more than any other country, but there are many many many other countries that are close to their number. It hurts to see so many people die because of sugar, and this is why I agree that soda's and other sugar drinks should be taxed.

One of those articles makes the argument that people shouldn’t be allowed to use food stamps for soda which I’m not sure how I feel about.

In all seriousness though, it’s sort of depressing for these people but I don’t know if a soda tax would help them. Unless it was put towards some sort of community dental care?

I drank a ton of Mountain Dew when I was younger and in a really really bad place mentally (like 2-3 cans a day) now I’m missing 3 molars because by the time I could afford to do anything about it they were too far gone and I’ve spent thousands on dental care in the past few years. I’ve joked to my dentist that I have meth mouth with out the fun parts of doing meth.
Nope. They’ll ban Looney Tunes, because Bugs Bunny is the world’s most famous drag queen, and Warner Bros. has spent DECADES grooming children Look how these people turned out.
He wants to ban drag queen story time, but the bill only bans "entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest". So I can only conclude that he finds a drag performer reading a children's book to children to have overt sexual nature.

My question is drag shows are considered sexual and grooming childen. Explain to me how beauty pageant for 4, 5 6 years isnt grooming them? Forcing little girls to wear heavy make up and dress up like a young women along with heels appear to groom children more for pedophile. Dont even get me started with cheer leading. During a local Football team I took my grandmother her mom was helping out in confession. Well low and behold! There were girls 13, 14, 15 moving body parts so fast I lost track. Some of dancers were grinding up against the male cheerleaders rubbing their legs against each other. I have seen Drag shows, nothing in those shows could compare to the soft porn dances being done at our local foot team by cheerleaders I dont hear a peep out of parents when their own daughters and sons are making all the moves even growning and mouning out with each hip thrust. Florida really wants make an issue of drag storyline? Wait til they se the video I took of our cheerleaders. Might be very eye opening.
The very same thing happened in the EU announced it's plan to introduce more restrictive gun laws and tried to, literally, ban all semi-auto guns. What makes it especially damning is that even such restriction would have had zero effect on the Paris terrorist attacks those restrictions were supposed to prevent because the terrorists used illegal full-auto AKs from the Balkans.
Yes, I fully agree the 2nd should have been written better. I prefer the Czech version, it grants the "right to defend own life or life of another person also with arms under conditions stipulated by law".

The more idiotic laws you try to implement, the more resistance you'll meet and the US has a long history of idiotic gun laws.

The only idiotoc gun law we have is the second amendment, which was so poorly written than 250 years later 100 million people can't understand that "militia" was required at the time because there was no army. The combination of low intelligence, lacking education and 2A (gun proliferation) will cause the end of the United States, pretty sure of it. Just wait for trump to lose again.

Yes. Was I not clear? Lol I'm not worried about the hearing status of gun owners. Range shooting uses earmuffs anyway. Suppressors are banned because of their possible use in helping commit crimes. Idk how I wasn't clear when I implied that the absolute freedom to own guns was NEVER the intentions of the second amendment?
I'm (european) disappointed with the choice on Brexit because I think it was done for the wrong reason, and that the voters were manipulated by populists.
Watching what the British government has done to "take advantage of Brexit" since the vote has been a bitter lesson for many.

That's the thing - that doesn't even make sense. But it's so demeaning to say that people only voted because they're right wing, or people only voted because they're racist. Our society is so so so divided in it because almost every sub group of people voted different ways for different reasons, there's no clear cut lines. Politics is just different ideas on how you fix the same problems, but we are too busy assigning blame to the people that are not us.

There were plenty of people who've said they voted because they believed the NHS would get more funding. There were plenty of fishermen who voted brexit because they believed the EU caps were destroying their livelihoods. And there were plenty of people who believed, and still believe because they post it on reddit regularly, that cheap EU labor was keeping down their wages.
We're talking single digit majority here, and a lot of these people's lives were unequivocally put in danger by Donald Trump, so this actually seems possible, but probably a pipe dream. I guess The GOP would have committees if they had the majority, but The Speaker could form her own as well?
You need a majority in the House, not only be the one getting the most votes. Pelosi could come in first place for dozens of roll calls, but wouldn't become speaker unless she got 218 votes, which would require Republicans voting for her.

If it's a majority of one or two, all bets are off. But anything beyond that and surely theyll manage to push through. Even of it requires a dozen roll calls.

It would be the end of their career, not sure there's any moderates left who'd want to go out that way (especially because they aren't Pelosi moderates, they are right wingers who dislike MAGA, they don't have a problem with mainstream GoP positions).

The Dems could all unite behind a moderate Republican that they'd prefer over anyone the Republicans would vote for, and they'd only need a few GOP defectors to win a vote. I don't think it's a crazy idea at all.

I agree that I don’t think it will happen. It just makes it interesting to think about since it sure doesn’t seem like McCarthy will have the votes right now. I’d imagine Republicans will fall in line but Andy Biggs is rumored to be vying for Speaker too….
He knows the lie that he didn't utterly shit the bed so badly historians will study it for generations, won't live for long after he's gone and so he desperate to salvage a win somehow.
It seems Putin believes the West will end this war with overwhelming conventional force if he uses nukes, which is a very important consideration as I think he'd try, just a little one to scare Ukraine into submission, as seems to be overwhelmingly the goal of Russian military strategy, if that hadn't been 'leaked'.

Since the war began, it's been infuriating seeing so many people criticizing the west for escalating and forcing Russia to invade Ukraine and trying to argue that we should be seeking diplomacy instead of sending more weapons. Yeah, because US soldiers are raping and torturing Ukrainians in Ukraine, and Putin gives a shit about diplomacy. Oh wait ...

Europe (and Ukraine) needs to be preparing for US support collapsing when Republicans take the presidency. We need to be able to keep Ukraine in the fight without relying so heavily on the US.

There's nothing in Finland to steal, and you can't get through Finland to anyplace you couldn't get through more sensible means of transport. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia make Finland a shitty route to invade Russia through, even in the kinds of paranoid delusional dreams where someone would want to invade Russia in this day and age.
Pardon the gap in my knowledge as I'm canadian so the political state of Finland is off my radar but do anticipate a war with Russia in the coming future?

I’m confident that every country that currently shares a border with Russia, or it’s lapdogs, have quietly pulled out their national defence plans and dusted them off to start going over them and revising them to fit the current state of the world and technology.

Putin will start getting desperate over the next several months and will have to do something major to try to show that his government is still strong and that the Russian military is still powerful. As it is now, he desperately needs a major military victory in order to get the troops to fight and not just surrender or kill their commanding officer and run away. This will become even more important as he starts drafting people from cities like Moscow.
These people 100% knew what they were doing was wrong. They are 100% responsible for their own actions.

Here's the thing: there are solutions to these mental health issues, the problem is getting them to take their meds. But, they've been brainwashed to believe they're mind-control and will NEVER take them. Better to just lock them up and keep everyone else safe for a while.
They're not in great shape for 2024 as is even if they do squeak the House. If it's a narrow enough margin, McCarthy will have relatively less influence and there will be substantially more pressure against Republican obstructionism. The public is, by and large, fed up with Republican bullshit. Republicans are starting to get fed up with their bullshit. That they can win the House at all has more to do with structural deficiencies in our representation than the will of the people and when the electorate sees the next 2 years of potential progress stymied by shitheel Republicans, I don't think they'll be able to spin anything easily back in their favor.
I wonder if Dems could get the support of 3 Republican house members (if the margin ends up being that small in the house) to end the Hastert rule, so the Democratic minority can still raise bills.

I’d prefer Dems to hold the house but if it’s a 1-2 seat majority then you’ve still got the potential for a few defectors to help get things done (or not done in the case of bullshit impeachment hearings. Think about how frustrating Sinema and Manchin have been in the Senate and then imagine 218 of them running around on the Republican side. It won’t be as good as a democratic majority but it might prevent things like disbanding the Jan 6 committee.
They were always gonna vote. It’s their thing, and they do it faithfully. Like it’s a duty to god or some shit.

If they arrest Trump days before the midterms, there will be exponential turnout, outrage, and violence from the GOP/GQP, thus possibly meaning Democrats lose Congress and people getting hurt/harmed/killed.

They've been parroting Russian propaganda lines for as long as Russia's special forces have been holidaying across the border.
And if that results in belarus and russia having to divert some of their forces to those borders, that would just be a fortuitous coincidence.

There are already troops on russias borders. And increasing our troops there, given that russia has already invaded one european country and has threatened to do so with others, would be logical. Putin can think of it what he wants, what the fuck do we care? He already claims we were about to invade (we weren't), so nothing will change there.

NATO should respond by massing troops on the belarussian border in poland and on the baltic borders with russia. Afterall, we clearly have to defend ourselves from countries who have proven they are willing to launch attacks from their territories into their neighbouring nations.

Nah. The simple fact of increased troop build up will require a response even though their generals know NATO has no intention to do anything. They could never let that kind of move go unanswered for political reasons.

Russia won't attack across NATO borders, and we won't attack across russia's, so in the end all that will happen is that we force russia to allocate some of their resources to sit on their asses on a quiet border instead of killing ukrainians.

it's more likely pressure to divert eastern ukraine forces west, and could be used to start an offensive towards Kyiv which would probably be started by a false flag attack from russian forces, either a missile strike from the east or a bomb from the russian forces already stationed there.

If Russia had to respond by redeploying a proportionate amount of troops to the NATO borders then your idea would be effective, still incredibly risky that an accidental escalation would happen, but it would work.

Can you say the chances of an accidental escalation are worth taking over just giving Ukraine more weapons or sending NATO special forces in as “volunteers” the same way Russia sent their special forces on “vacation” to Crimea?

I don’t think giving Ukraine weapons, money and training is appeasement… I don’t think maintaining current troop numbers on the borders of nato is appeasement.

Let’s keep giving weapons to Ukraine, whatever they need, but for fuck sake don’t put troops on Russia’s borders, if nothing else that is what Putin wants, it makes him right. He’ll get to talk about NATO threatening Russia and provoking him and how we’re trying to destroy the Russian way of life. Can we just make him look like an idiot like we are now rather than a genius?
If you just tax the shit out of legal drugs, you will still have a black market for drugs. This is exactly what we've seen in California and other states that have had legal cannabis for years now. We still have a huge black market for cannabis, bigger than the legal market. Because too much taxes and regulation.
I agree drugs should be legalized, but we need to stop kidding ourselves with the "legalize it and tax it" idea.

Edit: Also no place in the entire world stopped the black market for cannabis by legalizing it. Black market weed just goes cheaper and is usually unclean cannabis grown for legal market.

So the legal cannabis will be safer. Don't claim it will be cheaper if you also want quality. You don't get cheap and quality from almost anything in life.

Stringent Quality checks create situations where a farmer can grow hundreds of pounds of cannabis. But fails tests because a single bud in that batch had a few microbes on it. Now they need to build infrastructure that can grow clean cannabis with no mold or microbes or heavy metalsor anything. This means they need to sell the cannabis at a higher price to make up for all the infrastructure needed. But wait they already have a few hundred pounds of cannabis that cant be sold on the legal market. 90% of farmers aren't destroying their crop if they can help it. They will dump hundreds of pounds of "dirty" weed on the black market. Which will be bought because its cheaper than the over priced legal weed that is overpriced because red tape increases the cost to produce cannabis and that cost is paid by the consumer not the producer.
What are our shoulder launched anti-air weapons for? Destroying Russian helicopters. What are they doing? Destroying Russian helicopters.
Yes… the US is running out of the old weapons we are willing to send to Ukraine. Not really a big surprise since we don’t mass produce them since they are essentially obsolete to our armed forces.

The U.S. Military no longer has to consider how to maintain and dispose of old weapons. (At least for a bit.).

Former Soviet Bloc nations are soon to become customers of U.S. arms manufacturers - if not for new purchases, then at least for maintenance contracts on the surplus equipment they’re being given.

That makes it pretty clear that, despite not drawing on stockpiles intended directly for US military use, they do still intend to "replenish US inventories" that are being drawn down to supply Ukraine.

Just a reminder here are 2,000 Bradley IFVs in storage (which could have been sent months ago), which would be a massive upgrade to Ukrainian mechanized forces and much better than sending Soviet-built tanks that have built-in turret-launching bulleyes or crappy BMPs. Just because the Ukrainians know how to use them doesn't mean it's the best option, sending Bradleys is the much better option.

Exactly. I 100% agree. I very strongly support sending ATACMS to Ukraine, this is literally the perfect war for them. In most wars, the USAF would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the Army gets to them. ATACMS has a "measly" 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home. Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range. The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too. If we don't send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation. Lastly, ATACMS is going to be retired and replaced by Precision Strike Missile anyway. Better they be used to support a worthy cause than destroyed because the whole system simply got retired.
They’re not gonna execute 15,000 people. They simply don’t have the means to do so, nor would the population and other countries just tolerate it. They’re using this as a justification to mass execute the more vocal protesters/leaders and to let other protesters know that they could be next if they don’t step back.
Perhaps, but the main takeaway would be an event like a mass execution of innocent civilians could easily be used a prelude to war/invasion and get a lot of support.

Yeah but use your brain for a second and look into what created the circumstances for those genocides or mass executions to even be possible. Killing 15,000 people is a big ask, who is going to dish it out? If you are using soldiers and bullets you have the nazi problem: How do you handle the moral apprehension of people killing 15000 HUMAN BEINGS no different than their executioner besides circumstance. There is a reason why the nazis switched to chemical means of executing their prisoners.

Yeah like, the nazis were fighting almost the entire world yet still had the time and ressourcen to commit the holocaust and other crimes. As awful as it sounds but 15000 people is probably on the "easier" end of mass murder commited by regimes....

Would they get away with it if they publicly executed 15,000 people in the town square? Probably not, this is not the Middle Ages anymore nor are they Genghis Khan. I know this type of shit happened in Srebrenica for instance, but the situation is a bit different now. There’s no war and they’re killing their own population. If you kill 15,000 people you will have at least 10,000 very pissed off families and many many more people who were friends with these people. They’d have to turn into NK in order to maintain power after that and I don’t think the population would tolerate that. But you know what, if they actually do kill 15,000 people, that might just be the event that finally toppled this insane regime.

15,000 people is maybe not a lot in the world of some of the worst mass executions, but it's still a fuck ton of people.

And if you decide the chemical approach: how do they get enough chemicals to kill 15000 people? Who is going to sell you it with all the sanctions Iran already has on them, plus any global pressure not to aid in these executions.
There are a few jokes here but yes, china has a lot of different laws regarding software designed to be released, this can be small things like certain terminology or what is allowed to be shown for instance Chinese versions of videos games will have additional censorship.
I believe the US Tesla software and the EU tesla software is quite different to due to the requirements around being able to classify the self driving technology so some features are disabled/enable to comply with specific laws.

Saudi Arabia is pretty safe. I have relatives there who aren’t naive to Saudi and nothings happened to them. Honestly most of the Middle East is safe for Westerners and you’ll get on without many issues if you use a little common sense and respect the local laws/norms.
Before we go on any further i want to make clear that I’m not defending Saudi Arabia here but being misleading about the actual situation with generalized statements only serves to make it easier for them to vilify and demonize those who are against them.

I’ve had female American and Canadian teachers from the high school I went to in Kuwait that went there without issues. Honestly, if you aren’t going out in short shorts, crop and/or sleeveless tops you’ll likely be left to your own devices in SA as a foreigner visiting. There’s several valid criticisms to make about Saudi Arabia, the idea that you’re going to be unsafe as a foreign woman there isn’t one of them tbh.

While I agree that the offenses people get executed for in Saudi Arabia are outrageous, that is not the crux of the issue. The capital punishment in itself is the most inhumane part. When advocating for the death penalty you have to accept at least one of these statements: The state is either never wrong, or that executing innocent people is an unfortunate but accepted fact of this system.

Most countries do not punish murderers or any/most other crimes by death, so why is it ok for the US to execute prisoners, but not other countries? The US also routinely tortures prisoners held indefinitely without trial in Guantanamo bay, I don't think the US has any moral high ground to stand on when it comes to capital punishment.

Don’t forget that the American now jail people indefinitely without trial. They even kill them with drone based only on the pattern of their movements.
It’s not weird. It’s correct. Bakhmut is only important in that the fighting in the ruins there keeps other Ukrainian cities like Kramatorsk safe and intact.
It’s been a long and bloody battle, which is in line with Bakhmut being one of the most fortified cities in eastern Ukraine. This should point to evidence showing it is incredibly valuable to hold and incredibly strategic to both sides. If the city succumbed earlier to Russian occupation, it either was not strategic, or Ukraine has larger issues amongst its fighting battalions. The battle has been protracted and at great cost to both sides, with the aggressor seeing larger losses.

Just replied to one of your other comments regarding this same topic. The city itself is worthless to the Russians, they want the area cleared so they can move their artillery in to position for further incursions westward towards Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.

Correct, the true strategic value of this battle is more-so about the hilly terrain surrounding Bakhmut, not so much the city itself (as evidenced by the fact it’s been blown off the face of the earth). If the Russians do in fact drive the UA out of the area, which is increasingly likely, their artillery will have clear lines of sight westward to both Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.

Obviously that wasn’t/isn’t the case considering how many forces have been thrown at it, as well as how heavily fortified it is.
Cool, first let’s cut off all the federal dollars to red states, then allow foreign countries to put heavy duties on all products manufactured in red states.
Step 6: Blue states, now comprising Blue USA, suddenly have extra money since they don't need to support red states. They also have less pushback against liberal policies like expanding healthcare access. Advances come smoother in Blue USA.

Eh. I'm fine with this. Many will continue to feed their populations the bread and circuses of the culture wars while ignoring the real issues, which will drive many states onto the Zimbabwe route.

Once they're in ruin, swoop in, seize all assets of value, decimate them like the Anglo-Saxons did, to Northumbria to destroy the Danelaw and reestablish them as vassals who'll get to experience a thousand years of generational poverty, like Northern England is continuing to experience, today.

That would be a lot worse for the kid than being left with honestly highly trusted members of society in an extremely public and secure and videotaped location... at the very least, could warrant panic. Again, the authorities didn't charge anyone or anything, and plenty of times things like this happen it gets referred to the home nations child services etc... just a fuckup.

Maybe a tiny sliver of malicious compliance combined with not fully understanding policies. They thought free baby, but the seat held things up, during confusion with no ability to get ticket just run to try to stop the plane?

Hungary's not going to move unless and until Turkey ratifies. If Turkey rejects, then Hungary will just forget Finland and Sweden ever tried to join NATO in the first place.

Since Finland is located in between Sweden and Russia, as long as Finland joins NATO, that will make Sweden much safer even if Sweden can’t join together.

Russian black sea fleet is at the moment afraid to go out on the open waters against Ukraine, I wonder how they would feel to go up against the navies of Bulgaria and Romania when they have support from aviation of the rest of NATO.

I mean, last I was in Russia, they celebrated Christmas on the 7th of January, as the orthodox church didnt adjust for the Julian calender, like the catholics back when….
TL:Rd The Russian Orthodox church and some other eastern Orthodox churches still use a "Traditional" calendar that doesn't account for the leap years so it is partially shifted and will become more shifted as time goes on..

It's a fairly standard split that comes from the Russian Orthodox churches not being able to attend the Synod where the calendar was revised due to Soviet influence.

So, you have like 30% of Ukrainians being Catholic and some other percentage of Orthodox also aligning with a "western rite" that uses the Revised calendar since 2014 as a reaction against the Russian Patriarchs support for the Russian invasion. The Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch, the Orthodox Churches of Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Orthodox Church in America all align with Constantinople rather than Russia. The Orthodox Churches of Jerusalem, Serbia, Montenegro, Poland, North Macedonia, Georgia, and the Greek Old Calendarists and others align with Russia.

Russian Orthodox use the 7th of January. But a number of Ukrainian Orthodox churches turned to answer to the Patriarchate of Constantinople since 2014, and they Revised their Julian Calendar in a Synod in 1923 to conform with a December 25th Christmas date.

My guess that because Eastern Orthodox and Russian Orthodox follow the old Julian Calendar (which means Dec 25th has no significance whatsoever), saying "Merry Christmas" on Dec 25 when Western Christians celebrate it comes across as an f.u. and maybe something along the lines of "screw y'all so much that we won't even celebrate Christmas on the Russian Orthodox Church's Christmas Day.".

But that is just speculation on my part, and it has been clarified in other comments that there are Eastern Orthodox and Western Rite Christians alike in Ukraine, so Zelenskyy recognizes both dates. Eastern Orthodox Christmas isn't until Jan 7.

This reads to me similar to an "I'll eat my hat" statement so no even if it happened he probably wouldn't actually resign.

He didn't actually threaten to resign, he said he's so certain Democrats won't reach across the aisle to circumvent Gaetz & co, he'll resign if they do. He's just posturing, and everyone knows he doesn't have the backbone to follow through on such a promise. Pretty disappointing after reading that headline, but at this point, I'm the asshole for taking a headline in r/politics at face value lol.

Damn, why'd you have to get my hopes up? He's just posturing to try to reassure his constituents that he's not being a useful idiot for Democrats. There's zero chance he'd actually follow through on this if a more moderate Republican were to get elected.

Ukraine 'discovers' evidence of this plot by Putin and arranges for it to get leaked to NATO and the press... then Ukraine does exactly what Putin was going to try and make Belarus believe Ukraine was going to do. Belarus gets mad and blames Russia. Either there's a popular uprising or Russia gets ejected from Belarus and Ukraine doesn't have to worry about that northern border anymore.
Respectfully, I can't tell if you're confused about what's being discussed, which is a warning that Russia plans to fake an attack in Belarus and blame Ukraine.

The audience is obviously the people of Belarus and Russia but I doubt the Belarusians will buy it, including Lukachenko. There is nothing in it for Belarus to join this war.

And that window fly’s right open if Belarus sends its army into Ukraine. I bet those brave protesters in Belarus have been planning for that very possibility this past year.

Lukashenko knows that if he sends his army in Ukraine his people will then see it as an opportunity to rise up and overthrow him. He needs his soldiers to stay in Belarus and keep him in power. If he sends his army into the meat grinder of Ukraine he knows his days are numbered, it’s why it hasn’t happened yet and won’t happen.
The bots and shills haven't gotten their new talking points yet. Give it 24h. Once the software update hits they'll be back on track. That wasn't a joke or sarcasm. I've seen this before after big events.
They 100% don't care about reality. They'll declare that it is a mandate and push full steam ahead. Biden is all but guaranteed to be impeached multiple times if they get control. It's one of their deeply person goals. They need him to be impeached more times than Trump was.

12 impeachments, and that's probably about it. It looks very unlikely that the GOP will take the Senate. Even with the House, their margins will be so slim that it'll be difficult to pass any legislation. Assuming they have a legislative agenda.

Yesterday US Senators. Lindsey Graham, Richard Blumenthal & Sheldon Whitehouse met President Zelensky in Ukraine. Graham said: 🇺🇦 military needs tanks. I am tired of the s show surrounding who is going to send tanks & when are they going to send them.
Nearly a year later they can't control stolen territory (18%) as Ukraine starts getting the good shit lol.

the idea is that Ukraine gets those tanks before that and they can push the russian out before the russians army gets ready for the spring.

They're training themselves away from shame in any way. LBJ passed civil rights in the 1960's in an all white congress with a real nasty shame tactic among other ways. I agree we need tactics other than shame and disdain.
The ONLY appropriate response to the willful idiots on the right is disdain. They are trying to destroy American democracy via both fraudulent and violent means, and refuse to pull their heads out of the sand, as it were, despite numerous and ongoing attempts to explain why their "beliefs" are not only false, but incredibly dangerous and harmful.

"Election deniers" hold their asinine beliefs in spite of ALL evidence. The GOP tried to overthrow the election, not just via a coup attempt at the Capitol, but with a series of 60+ frivolous law suits, ALL of which were rejected by courts across the country due to total lack of merit. Trump's latest suit against HRC and dems was likewise dismissed and accompanied by a heavy bench slapping and the imposition of substantial financial penalties against Trump's lawyers for wasting the courts' time with their sham.

Reason does not work with these fascist morons, and they disdain and slander all sources of information other than corrupt, habitual liar GOP politicians and faux "news" outlets like Fox, Infowars, etc.
Wildcat strikes are not out of the question if this passes without the sick days being added. Congress may be playing with fire here, and we've already seen parts of the GOP use this to undercut the Democrats.
Just like we watched Democrats constantly get blamed for Republicans filibusters for the last couple years. Or how one Democrat voting against something made it the Democrats fault if it didn't pass, but every single Republican could also not vote against that and they caught none of the blame.

Also, You know every bit as well as I do that it will be blamed entirely on Democrats. There's too much actual thinking that has to be done in order to come to the conclusion that it's solidly the company's fault, and after the last several years we all should know better that that's not what most people are going to do.

It was only 2 years ago that Republicans attempted to overthrow our government and install a one-party system, and since then they were rewarded by being given back one half of Congress. I'm going to stick by that quote.

Specifically, the Holman rule “allows amendments to appropriations legislation that would reduce the salary of or fire specific federal employees, or cut a specific program,” a document from the House Rules Committee explained.
The House Republicans’ proposed rules package for the 118th Congress aims to change several procedures around congressional operations, and one of those proposals holds particular significance for the federal workforce.

Typically, federal agency leaders will testify before the appropriations committees about their projects and priorities at the beginning of each year’s budget process. Once a lawmaker introduces an amendment to an appropriations bill on the House floor, though, the affected agency cannot officially come before Congress to respond to the amendment.

It’s a rule that the House last reinstated back in 2018, and although none of the proposed changes at the time actually went through, lawmakers did offer a couple of amendments related to the provision.

>The rule was reinstated as part of the rules package enacted at the beginning of the 115th Congress in 2017 for a period of one year, unless extended by Congress. It was championed by Freedom Caucus member Morgan Griffith, Republican of Virginia, who favored empowering individual members of Congress to strategically reassign workers according to policy needs, and to cut programs perceived as wasteful. Republicans said that the rule change would increase accountability and streamline the appropriations process, and said they did not intend it as a broad change to the appropriations process.

House Republicans recommended reinstating the “Holman rule,” a provision that lets lawmakers offer amendments that would make changes to federal agency and personnel functions during the appropriations process. Those changes can include, notably, reductions to federal employees’ salaries, as well as reductions to staffing numbers at agencies.
“The prosecutors have sought approval from a federal judge to invoke what is known as the crime-fraud exception, which allows them to work around attorney-client privilege when they have reason to believe that legal advice or legal services have been used in furthering a crime. The fact that prosecutors invoked the exception in a sealed motion to compel the testimony of the lawyer, M. Evan Corcoran, suggests that they believe Mr. Trump or his allies might have used Mr. Corcoran’s services in that way.
Another lawyer for Mr. Trump, Christina Bobb, then signed a statement asserting that a “diligent search” had been conducted at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s residence and private club in Palm Beach, Fla., and that there were no additional documents bearing classification markings. Ms. Bobb has told investigators and others that Mr. Corcoran drafted the statement, and that she added some caveats to it, seeking to make it sound less ironclad.

Straight to prison. You certainly can't just claim ignorance and being a shitty lawyer when you "added some caveats" to the legal, binding documents that you put your signature to. If these reports are accurate, Bobb clearly knew that what she was signing wasn't true, and that Donald was still hiding the top secret documents that were most intriguing and important to him.
I overheard a conversation yesterday where in a span of 15 seconds a person went from literally yelling at the TV (FOX news of course) about Biden being a traitor because of five documents to Trump was the President and can declassify anything just by saying so.
I feel like Biden is baiting the GOP into investigating him for less than 20 classified documents so they would have to explain why they are defending Trump at least 60 classified stolen materials.

"I'm not really concerned about the classified documents so much as why Trump was treated differently to Biden".

And to answer it, you might want to check the question you were asked where the interviewer literally laid out the differences for you in terms of the sheer number, Trump lying about returning everything and Trump's refusal to comply with subpoenas.
Reagan would’ve been fine in the modern Republican Party. He would’ve just adjusted just political beliefs to fit the times, he was an actor after all. He would’ve loved Donald Trump and would’ve had us sending weapons to Putin officially or unofficially.
I don’t think being anti soviet is comparable with being anti Russian. It is closer to being anti Chinese today. I see this come up a bunch some times and it ignores that the Soviet government collapsed and no longer exists. The closest to a successor state, Russia, has always had pretty far right alignments so of course republicans are more aligned to it.

Also you are right, while Reagan was trying to firm up his legacy he did do some last minute changes. But he also claimed he was no longer mentally capable in a criminal trial related to Iran Contra so eh.

I get what people mean when they say Reagan would be seen as a lib today. They mean republicans are getting more extreme. But the point misses that Reagan’s beliefs were moving as well with the time. Like Trump he would just move to the right along with the base. And then the reason that’s worth arguing is because the modern far right exhilaration is due to a lot that happened under Reagan so trying to return to that is self defeating. We shouldn’t be doing “make America great again” but for republicans.

The largest standing army that is strictly within Europe is Italy at \250 000. Finland has about 25 000 active personnel, but because they've had conscription this entire time, they have 280 000 fully trained personnel that they can call on in wartime. They have another 900 000 reservists. They're also highly motivated, with saying they were in favour of conscription and believe the Finnish people should defend themselves in an armed conflict. So... more or less you can count probably 80% of those reservists, who all have military training, as part of the Finnish military. So yeah, over one million people with military training ready to fight tooth and nail. It honestly makes most of the militaries in Europe look like a joke given the Finnish population. They've done that because they aren't part of NATO and couldn't just say "I'm going to tell my dad and he's going to beat you up.".
This. Without monetary funding rebuilding, and therefore suffering, would have taken decades. Eventually post-ww2 governments, even with a newly foundend democracy, would have been pushed by the citizens to align with the Soviets, if the US wasn't willing to provide.

To clarify, of course this wasn't the only cause. But it was a cash infusion that was used to kickstart the economy. This is one of the most basic concepts of economics. The rest was the fact that suddenly europe had a lot of people in need of all kinds of products.

The mRNA technology which is the key to the vaccine was developed in germany. Honestly it is such a weird thing to claim that the US is "subsidizing" europes healthcare. There is still a lot of research being done in europe. And R&D is not the reason why US healthcare costs that much. It is the way hospital and pharma companies are structured.
This is the plan for everything: gnaw away at it then point out how useless it is and so everyone wants privatization. Education, utilities, Medicare/NHS, Social Security, EVERYTHING.

Yes this. 2008 set a horrible precedent when the govt bailed out the big banks and the financial system and held no one accountable other than Madoff who ran a small boutique firm that happened to screw over wealthy clients. Those CEOs and execs knew what was happening, should’ve got jail time, and been barred from working in the financial sector for the rest of their lives. The banks should’ve been forced to downsize, de-monopolize, and been subject to strict new regulations. Instead, they got what was basically a free handout and they even managed to get bigger by acquiring some of the regional banks that didn’t get much of Uncle Sams help.

Fast forward to 2020, covid hits and while this problem wasn’t the direct result of the financial industry and they had 10 years of one of the largest bull markets in history, they weren’t well prepared for a disaster as they spent most of their excess cash on stock buybacks instead of saving for a rainy day. But no need to fear - The Fed is here! The industry has become so open to risk because they know the govt will bail them out - they call it the “Fed Put”. They are more willing to accept risk now than ever, because the expectation is now that Uncle Sam will save them if the shit really hits the fan.

So in short, our mostly Boomer leaders and grand disciples of Reaganomics, Bush neocon warhawks, and now ultra MAGA did a great job of running up our nations credit card, only the debt doesn’t get discharged when they die - it gets passed on to us. They are basically using the govt to fund their pet projects of war, socialism for the rich, etc until it becomes apparent the govt is dysfunctional, then they will blame SS and Medicare instead of themselves.
The sensor on the missile itself is designed to go into bulldog mode against fast movers to turn slowly. Laser guided missiles would’ve been the way to go with the balloon.
Talking with one of the air crews in charge of one of the balloons recent shootdowns, they're firing sidewinders that have no warhead, just the missile.

1) I literally stated that I talked with one of the airman/men responsible for the shootdown. The AiM-9X that was launched on multiple occasions are not armed. They are dud headed heaters that impacted the balloon and caused it to rupture and decompress.

In case I have missed it has anyone said if they've determined exactly what the nature of these balloons are? I know China said the first one was meteorological, but I don't think anyone is taking their word for it. Now that it has been shot down and retrieved, as well as a few others, have they been able to determine exactly what these balloons were doing?

do we have actual concrete proof they are spy balloons yet? every report doesn’t mention specifics in terms of sensors, data, or sensitive electronics.
The boring answer is that it probably truly is a meteorological balloon with instrumentation that veered off course.
And the big reason to assume it wasn't really there for any nefarious purpose, regardless of what anyone in the media might be saying, is that balloons are extremely difficult to control the direction of. They're blown around by wind. That's why they use them to study weather. And look at pretty views. And pretty much nothing else.

The US is saying it's a spy balloon because, without 100% certainty about what it's actually doing, like all of the data is being 100% captured and interpreted by us, it's better to treat it as a threat than to not. So, say we think it's a spy balloon and then shoot it down, but there's literally nothing it can do as a military asset that some other vehicle couldn't do better.

Imagine being this hysteric over a harmless weather balloon and spending millions to shoot down a weather balloon with a missile.

Quite the contrary, the United States understands very well that it's intentional, and the notion that it was a weather balloon gone astray isn't even slightly credible.

The claim that it's a weather balloon gone astray was never even credible. It was capable of complex navigation, and seemed to have no trouble positioning itself over key surveillance locations in the U.S. and holding its position there. That it could do that, but somehow couldn't avoid straying from China to the United States is a laughable proposition.
It's a common tactic many countries use. Turn the people against each other so that they don't turn against you. We are seeing this play out in the United States right now. Turning the population against itself so that they don't realize that the government is the true problem.
Once people who live under theocratic authoritarian governments get what they want they will keep asking for more and more and more. This is why the leaders hardly ever bend or break. Because as soon as you overturn one policy it opens the flood gates.

The Black Sea fleet' primary focus has mostly been defending the southern naval approach to Russia from a NATO attack through the Dardanelle straight. This would in turn put the Russian fleet in the defensive sphere of their own land-based anti-ship missiles.
Im glad we agree. I should have commented on the other user claiming it was an arrogant move to keep these ships here. As if there was a better place for them to be.

Yeah, no, there is literally no other place for them to be. Turkiye would never let them leave and would never let any other ship enter during wartime. They're trapped in the Black Sea.

For all intents and purposes they are parking ships there. A navy without mobility is useless. And they are basically immobile. They're not allowed to pass through the Dardanelles. And as Ukrainians get higher range weapons and advance westward, they are increasingly hemmed in until they basically have to stay in port to be protected. And at that point, why even build hugely expensive mobile warships?
Brazil has curb stomped the FARC in the 90s during operation traíra. These guys are in for a rough surprize since jungle warfare is the main expertise of the Brazilian armed forces.
good luck to the Brazilian military, their going to need the big guns to deal with the illegal mining cartels. They have anti aircraft guns, recoilless cannons, lots of explosives and small arms. The private illegal miners will be fighting back too, they see mining as their only way out of poverty, and will gun down anyone who trys to stop them.

Its going to be a bloody mess trying to get rid of mining in that part of the Amazon, its been going on for so long, with so many now dependent on the underground economy, it could spark up serious unrest.

In the Amazon, you have a mix of semi legal small scale miners, illegal miners, and outlaws who do not give a crap what the law says. There is near zero enforcement of any law in the jungle, you cant police it, you cant even really enforce borders out there. One of my mentors spent 2 years working in an illegal gold mine from Suriname, but they didnt actually know which country they were technically in, it didnt matter, borders were non existent then. As a final note, corruption will take hold, military members will start working with cartels in exchange for immunity from the government. Its happened before, it will happen again, those that dont fall to corruption will start disappearing in the jungle.
You're probably more correct than you think. This tunnel is an ancient aqueduct, literally a plumbing system. The "Cleopatra's Tomb" claims are more than a little premature.
And why would Augustus give Cleopatra a good burial? He tried to strike her lover Antony from the historical record. He murdered her son Caesarion and wanted to take her back to Rome to hang during a triumph or rot in a prison.

Now now... archeology is a hard field to get into, which many undergrads fail to realize. I think it's only fair that we let the interns fight for the chance based on a multitude of tests measuring one's smarts, wit, agility, physical prowess and plot armor. No need to waste time with people who would just die and fall on something, risking breaking ancient artifacts that belong in a museum. With Harrison Ford due to hang up the whip after the next movie, it's only fair we start thinking about casting a new Indiana Jones.
I hope we all don't sanction each other because everyone basically agreed with them regarding it not being the proper forum. Have you looked at the joint statement issued when the G20 conference ended? It states that the parties agree that it's not the right place to resolve security issues.
This article is from February 22. The conference ended on February 25 with a joint statement with 2 specific paragraphs in which all participants other than China and Russia signed onto. That joint statement's 2 paragraphs has an agreement that "Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy" among other statements condemning the war.

India aint wrong here G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, India want to discuss russia and ukraine war but not about sanction , we want to discuss how war is affecting some poor countries and India is also urging other nation to give them some concession on debt.

People also forget that India and Russia have a pretty close relationship and just because there's some friction between India and China, it doesn't mean that India is suddenly a western lapdog who will do everything the west says esp if its against Indian interests.

Can we really blame India for looking after their own interests first?? We are talking about more than a billion people here and Russia is providing cheap oil right now, so unless the west somehow manages to supply India with millions of barrel of even cheaper oil than what Russia is providing, I don't think India is to be blamed..
For a year or two, 5 max, and then, in accordance with Russian historical tradition "and then it got worse.".
Oh come on. As much as I hate Yanukovich as a Ukrainian you can't compare the two in Russia ball-licking exercise.

There was no Russian military in Ukraine under him let alone attacking other countries. And EU association deal was moving somewhat forward. Really until his corrupt power become seriously endangered, he tried to stay away from Russian influence.

As a human and politician overall, he's a much bigger piece of shit than even Lukashenko, but he was miles away from him in terms of deepthroating Putin.

Yanukovich wasn't even in the same league. Or even the league below. He's a fly on the windshield of a car driven by Lukashenko sticking his tongue out of the window going right into Putin's asshole.

Nah, Yanukovych was a total "Yes man" to his master, Lukashynka is a sleezzy and slippery bastard. He retained power by inviting russian troops to the country back in 2020, and those troops are getting smaller with each day. He saw early into war that the horse he bid on is not going to win, so he's using every excuse to not send Belarusian army to the front. After war ends, he'll point out that fact and tell some bs that he had no choice. As for Belarusians, the time is not ripe yet for an uprising, but they should up their partisan game for sure.
I mean it's important to me in that this country has been taking away gun rights for years. I would like the federal government to step in to help in the state of Washinon, where they are considering a horrendously unconstitutional AWB.
Many countries suppressors are not regulated. The US needs to loosen gun laws as we have seen recent major shootings in some of the strictest states like California.

How would loosening gun laws lessen the amount of shootings? Please explain your logic. As for CA, many guns flow into the state from surrounding states with weaker gun laws. The solution is to strenhen gun control in those states... not loosen them in CA.

You want progress on gun control or any other issue? The democrats are squishy and the republicans are completely opposed. Seems like a simple choice.

The endless mass shootings, reproductive rights, voting rights, the failed sedition, bigotry, economic security weren’t enough to get even a majority of votes for the house. At least other elections gerrymandering was an excuse.

Who cares about polls. It only matters what people vote for. Gun control has been a loser in elections for a long time.

I think most politicians, at least the ones who get elected pander for votes. I also think there are 2 years every decade where the democrats have the house, senate and presidency so that some modicum of progress can he made.
I've been seeing more and more imperial Japanese flags being flown in recent years. Think that shame is trying to break through. Also seems wild to me that nobody really cares (except certain Asian countries) when they see that flag. Isn't that akin to flying a Nazi flag?
And yes Rising sun flag is a military flag, but do you know what other flag other than the Nazi party flag is banned in Germany? ( both 1935–1938 and 1938–1945 war ensign are banned unless in educational, artistic or scientific contexts).

While like you said its not a Imperical Japanese flag, however in Japan it was the IJA and in Germany it was a Nazi that drove the nations to war and to commit horrible atrocities.

Like imagine if Germany denies their atrocities, uses the swatsitka (Japan still uses the rising sun flag) and are actively racist towards the Jews. People would be furious, but Japan gets a free pass.

Japan's historical education is pitiful. People think their historical negationism only applies to the shit they did near ww2. But they revise things way back to Goguryeo era.
serious question: are russians able to access popular social media platforms like reddit, twitter, etc.? I just wonder if the average russian citizen knows how widely despised their government is.
My comment was directed more to your remark about how you Russians are 'despised' following the invasion. I'm of course not saying you should pick a side, that's up to you, but it is difficult to be an "enlighted centrist" in a highly internationally condemned invasion. And no, there are no "winners" here, but one part loses the most, and another the least. Shades of grey, as you say.

Dude, if your country performs the largest invasion in Europe since WWII, and is responsible for numerous atrocities in that country, as well as threatening with the destruction of humanity each time they experience a setback on the battlefield, it is only natural that your country will get criticism. And sadly, that means normal citizens will also sometimes have to endure criticism or even hate.

It's human nature, and you just have to deal with it and distance yourself from the atrocities your government commits. Otherwise, people will assume you are complicit, or at the very least, have nothing against the annexations, the massacre at Bucha, the missile attacks on civillian infrastructure, etc. This Russian victim-mentality I've seen a lot of places doesn't give you sympathy, it just makes you look apathetic and indifferent towards the actions of your countrymen.
The House Clerk will inform them that they are in violation of House rules and ask them to leave the floor, and they will not be allowed to vote. This is the process if a man doesn’t wear a tie or a jacket in the missouri house as well. The dress code in missouri house is-.
That's basically what the dress code is now. Men have to wear suit, tie, slacks, and dress shoes. Now women must wear pants, blazer, dress shoes. Before that they were allowed a blazer or a sweater.

They removed the sweater and added a cardigan. That's it. It's the same dress code as what's in the supreme court and roughly the same as the us Senate and Congress.

It's actually a dress code that's long been held in Missouri. They would remove you from the building until compliance. Male dress codes are stricter.

My point was that men had to wear suit jackets already as part of dress code. Now women are held to the same standard. It’s understandable that governments representatives have dress codes to account for some minimum of decorum when at the statehouse.

I’m usually the last to care but I get that in a building of government they need to set minimums to uphold decorum. Not doing it for everyone is just prejudiced.
Turkey deliberately shot down a Russian warplane a few years back. There was an official protest, Turkey apologised, that's it. If it was clear and provable beyond doubt that Russian deliberately targeted a Turkish ship, they still probably wouldn't do more than lodge a protest.
And hitting civilian ships, even Turkish-owned ones, serves Russia: it informs that Ukranian ports are not safe. And because Ukraine won't (and can't) do the same with Russian ports, it creates a situation where Russian ports are safer.

Endrogan wants to play both sides and has set himself up as a diplomatic mastermind because he is in the position. Putin does not mind that Turkish ships are hit because he knows that Endrogan will not raise issue with that.

So as far as Putin is concerned, this is winning because wasting military hardwa like this, even though e can barely or not at all able to replace it, is his only hope of scavenging any sort of victory here. He has very little hope of gaining a military victory as long as Ukraine is supported.

This is what happens when the leadership becomes enarmored with their own bullshit. They become distanced from reality and believe that their goals are effective.
There's a nice video on Youtube by Kraut that talks about this, I'm just summarizing from memory. In a sense the Mongols are to blame. No, really.
This created a power structure where the general population had little power and what it had kept getting siphoned by the rulers, who themselves had one ruler they bow to and in it's grace that they somewhat prosper. When the principality of Moscow finally managed to unite the Russians and drive out the Mongols, it just inherited the power structure and kept propelling it, Russia took many forms and philosophies over the centuries, but the power structure remained through out and it pretty much shapes Russian internal politics.

This is not to shift the blame away from current Russian "leadership" , many centuries has passed since then, but it's also an interesting point to view them through and one which might be key for any future shift in leadership structure over there.

It's interesting that Putin hasn't lined up any obvious successor, but I think you are right, hard to see anyone coming after him who could take over the reigns so firmly. It was different under communism, you had a system in place, this is just one man basically.
As an ex service member…we took all kinds of vaccines so we could do our job and be combat ready. If you are afraid of vaccines…you’re not fit for the military.
Thank god the people who don’t get the vaccine, and we’re planning to join the military, have a back up plan.

People in the military get so many vaccines. Way more than civilians. If not wanting vaccines is an issue, def don't join the military lol. They vaccinate for things you've never ever heard of.

While I am fully vaccinated, I can both still get and still infect someone. None of the information we were told has turned out to be true. I'm holding off on another booster.

It was never hailed as a 100% fix. Flu vaccines work just like the COVID one. They have to guess what strains you might encounter and produce a vaccine for it. If you come on contact with a different stain, you can still get it.

The vaccines were rushed...trials were skipped in favor of mini trials. That is why we are just now finding out there are side affects like heart issues in some teen males.
Now one of them was from I think a month ago, and another from 1-2 weeks ago, so technically if you would've asked them today - probably it would have changed a bit to this side or that, but I don't believe that it would have shown a different picture really.
The protests are estimated to be at best around the 100K people. That's 1% of the citizens in Israel, and 4% of the people who voted in the last elections. By no means do they represent the majority of Israel.

Israeli here. Most recent polls have shown that even if a majority want some sort of reform in the judicial system, the current reform is very unpopular in israeli society, even in ppl that voted for the likud (bibi's party).

Here's a quote from the article you've showed: "But a recent poll by Israel's Channel 12 found that only one in four Israelis supported the judicial reforms". Your article is from yesterday. Which means that he's talking about the latest poll made by channel 12.

Criminal referrals from Congress are a sticky subject. They don't inherently carry any legal teeth to them and are also kind of a "damned if you don't" action by the public, which Schiff is trying to get ahead of here.
And if it isn't directly regarding a crime related to Congress (contempt, witness tampering, obstruction, etc.) or evidence that the DOJ doesn't already have, some members have suggested it risks politicizing a potential legal process.
And if it isn't directly regarding a crime related to Congress (contempt, witness tampering, obstruction, etc.) or evidence that the DOJ doesn't already have, some members have suggested it risks politicizing a potential legal process.
It's basically just a political process that is voted on by a committee to say "DOJ, please do something about this evidence that a crime that has been committed".

Does the DoJ have a duty to investigate cases where they know (or have been told by another high authority, like congress) that crimes have been committed?

I would assume and hope that when Congress finds evidence of criminal activity the DOJ should investigate, the process would be to refer that information to the DOJ. Not doing so because of risk of being perceived as politicizing a political process is what is politicizing a legal process.
More like half the democrats I know. Probably half a dozen at least are full-blown socialist and several dozen are seriously anticapitalist and lean toward socialism but don't explicitly identify with that group full-stop.
What? You're not making sense. You're supposing that to be a "democrat" means to identify solely as a democrat. Most "democrats" I know are extremely disillusioned with the democratic party, and their identification with it is a very incomplete and approximate thing. But they still think of themselves as democrats.

And yes, I understand that the green new deal and wealth taxes are not part of the democratic party platform, and likely won't be in the next couple election cycles. But plenty of democrats are hard-core in that camp anyway, and operating under the naive/irresponsible/optimistic/mistaken/risky assumption that that's where the party is going.

If you're an actual communist - a term that is so often wildly thrown around with little regard for what it actually means - you might vote for Democrat candidates, but you're not a Democrat. Just look at their platform; if you interpret it broadly, it might have room for Democratic Socialists, but there's no mention of nationalizing industries, giving the means of production to the working class, abolishing the bourgeoisie and private property, etc. Supporting unions and universal healthcare doesn't make someone a communist.
Edit: it's been pointed out to me a couple of times that the correct nomenclature is "conjoined twins," so sorry for that. I'm leaving it as is in case any other olds run across it and realize they, too, have an unexamined racist term still in their repertoire as well.
Against their defense, they were given a 2nd chance to decide whether those racist comments or calling out the racist was the more appropriate thing. They, twice in that case, chose to side with the open racist.

How can you say “for no reason”? There’s literally a video of her helping to break a window & then start climbing through it right in front of an officer telling her not to do it.
But when someone breaks through multiple barricades and cordons and police lines and through doors to get into the Capitol, well that person...well that person is just an innocent bystander.

I've always held that capitol police should've shot anyone who crossed through a broken window or door into the Capitol Building while congress was in session and the VP was in the building. The common response to this line of thought on reddit is usually something along the lines of, "the crowd would have become enraged and swarmed them" but I disagree. Hell, we have video proof that as soon as Babbit was shot that crowd dissipated and no one else tried to climb through the window. I absolutely believe a few dozen bodies (and I don't think it would've taken that many) would have backed that crowd off immediately. I also believe that as soon as capitol police started firing it would've prompted faster response times from other law enforcement groups.

Sounds like The Lottery Jackpot from The Peripheral. Basically climate change set off a series of natural disasters like plagues, droughts, wars and on and on. One thing leads to another and eventually we’re all fucked.
Yeah we’d all be pretty fucked. Btw I love your username. I just had to put down my 4 year old female, Lucy, last week because of a tumor we didn’t find until it was too late. Her brother, Carlos, has been searching for her everywhere and rubbing his face against blankets she used to cuddle in and it’s breaking my heart.

To be fair, my hospital showed up when it came to pay. We all got raises and they would offer $600-$800 bonuses on top of OT if you picked up a shift. And you weren’t limited on how many shifts you could pick up.

I started my first nursing job out of school one week before the lockdowns began in the US, as an ICU nurse. If this shit jumps to humans, I’m quitting. I’m not going to be thrown into another fucking meat grinder and risk the health of myself or my family. I can’t handle another round of “Hero’s [sic] work here!”, signs in front of the hospital.
“Officers” should be a category on the daily and total losses pictographs a couple sources publish. Right next to “helicopters” and “special equipment”.

Russia has lost twice as many men then America lost in the 10 years of the Vietnam War. Their losses are comparable to American losses in World War 1. We joined WW1 about a year and a half before the end and had similar losses to Russia's losses this past year.

I just wish I saw more push-back in Russia. Russia has a population of 140-150 million. World War 2 had 9% of the American population serving in some capacity. Even splitting those that served with 10% in combat and 90% logistics your already up near 1.5 million fighting conscripts. I just don't want to assume they can't reach those historic percentages. Worst case scenario, Russia could keep this up for a long time. There are very good reasons against this scenario but they come with assumptions.

It's not that Russia is strong or they will win, I just don't see the breaking point. My priors would have had Russia's forces collapsing months ago. I'm wary of counting them out, despite everything.

Wager has stopped prison recruiting but the army still is. What's to stop Putin from forcibly mobilizing prisoners? Or Sending police with quotas to frame innocents and ship them to war? We already have seen it in occupied territories. He seems to be content with half measures that slowly bleed Russia dry but prevent widespread dissent.
There’s “encouragement” from the other side too. The kind of encouragement that nudges you by posting your home address and harassing you in public for not being loyal enough to the dear leader. This is what populism is for Republican supporters, intimidation and threats of violence to extract the desired behaviors from politicians.
It encourages moderate republicans to try to distance themselves from their more extreme compatriots. It's Dems driving a wedge into the republican party and encouraging discord within the GOP.

Why don't you take your own advice and actually watch media outlets that don't match your right wing opinion? Because it's quite obvious that your only watching outlets that echo your political beliefs, and not the facts.

Yeah, but Putin and Kim Jong Un had good relations with Trump. . . that's doesn't make them pro-American.
Khan was overtly anti-American. Why would we want him in power. The reality of international politics is a friendly but corrupt leader is preferable to an unfriendly honest one. AND Khan wasn't honest so. . .

India gets more respect than Pakistan because it didn't bolster the Taliban, it's less poor and more democratic. But MOST important from the American perspective is that it is seeking to counter Chinese influence in the region. While Pakistan is accepting Chinese influence in it's country.

Khan wasn't terrible but he was opposed to the American agenda in the area and that made him "bad" from the American international politics perspective.

Huge commit. Especially the hundreds of armored vehicles. Bulldogs are tracked APCs. Some variants are IFVs.
I hope Australia and Canada send vehicles too. I haven’t heard much new out of Australia in a while. Their bushmasters were popular in Ukraine.

I wonder if the sophisticated missiles are more diverse than Brimstone IIs, but even just hundreds of those is great.

A russian soldier sitting in a S-400 radar will see dozens, if not hundreds of missiles in a short span, all labelled as GRAD missiles. They know these could be HIMARS, but they cannot possibly single out the HIMARS missiles in the bunch and/or shoot all of them down all at once. This way, HIMARS missiles get through even active defense.

The shorter range GMLRS HIMARS missiles keep getting through russian air defense. We meme "what air defense doing" but it's not really a credible meme (/r/ncd in shambles). They get through not because air defenses are inactive, but because the way they are used is abusing the fact that russian air defenses have a cap on how much stuff they can intercept at once.
Both are bad. Very bad. But attacking illegal immigration while utilizing and benefiting from it for profit imo is worse than having the family farm outside of California while representing California.
I think the family farm in Iowa, outside of California where those circumstances are so common as to be expected, is what makes it so bad because it gives the appearance that Nunes' imported undocumented workers from California to the Heartland in order to exploit them and dodge contributing to California tax coffers at the same time.

That instead of taking advantage of pre-existing, readily available undocumented labor in a state that has far more protections, services and support for undocumented workers, it could appear that Nunes, knowingly and with premeditation, went out of his way to procure and import undocumented labor in a state where the undocumented would certainly enjoy less community and state support, and aid in the event of worker abuse.

But this is a great reminder that, no matter how much conservatives complain about undocumented workers and are enthusiastic about making undocumented people in the USA suffer, conservatives are WHOLLY against any sort of punishments for employers who hire and facilitate a system of recruiting and employing undocumented workers.
Japan's "carriers" are only capable of flying helicopters and F-35s. Two are 20,000 ton and two are 27,000 ton ships.
For comparison, the UK's Queen Elizabeth class weigh in around 70,000 tons each. The US's Nimitz class weigh in around 100,000 tons each. Even the US's America class helicopter assault ships are around 45,000 tons.

So Japan does have ships that could be considered carriers, but they aren't in the same tier as the big guys.

Edit: Japan is realistically looking at squaring up against China. I'm sure China is really having a "good hard think" about the prospect of approximately 40 F-35Bs in the entire Japanese Navy coming up against 150 Chengdu J-20s, 400 Shenyang J-11s, and 500 Chengdu J-10s.

Unless Japan plans to fight America or Britain, small carriers loaded with F-35s should leave any prospective adversary having a good hard think.

No, they have "aircraft carriers" in the sense they have relatively tiny ships that are only really useful for domestic defense. Japan is constitutionally prohibited from having an effective aggressive military. They are far more capable of defending themselves now but their military is still not capable of waging an offensive war.

Yup, that's why the most powerful and advanced military in the world built the Gerald R. Ford, the largest warship ever made, and commissioned her in 2017. Because the most powerful and advanced military in the world doesn't know the value of an actual carrier. It's obviously going to be obsolete and they were big dumb dumbs for spending money on it.

Their army is only 150k personnel and their air force is less than 50k. You can't wage a war with just a navy.
After all, the evil mewling fuckhead in charge already denied federal assistance while taking another payout from his railroad buddies. If the people of East Palestine want support, they need to neutralize their governor and his supporters, otherwise they're screwed.
Considering that even if Biden was there, pen in hand, to order the gears to turn on aid and support, the collection of vile filth and worthless, evil scum that is every republican would resist and impede the aid efforts, going to Ukraine actually gets stuff done.

I'd hazard a guess that when the next round of Ukraine aid comes to a vote the list of those opposing it will be nearly identical to those complaining about Biden's trip.

Of course they don't like it. It is a sign of effective international leadership on Biden's part, brings comfort to Ukrainians, and hurts the efforts of Putin to divide Ukraine's supporters.

Found the article somewhere else . Looks like he ended up back in Russia somehow and was made an example of . Poor sod . Actually , reading more , it appears that he was involved in a prisoner exchange . That's fucked up .
That's my point you fuckwit. Why would someone joke about Russia forcing US prisoners that were unjustly acquitted to fight against Ukraine and you people are making a joke of it. How does that not make sense? It was HER that the previous commenter brought up, and I stated that it's not cool to joke about forcing US citizens in Russian prison to fight against Ukraine? How the fuck are you both so dense to not understand what I meant? I swear everyone reddit is brain dead.

Because she's a US POW essentially? She's being held and Russia won't negotiate an exchange? Because I care far more about some random US WNBA player than some fucking corrupt foreign legion full of actual shit people and she's on there for a fucking weed vape. Why would you want her to fight? Y'all are a bunch of fucking idiots.
Also, even though it's small, there is still a very VERY slight chance that this would open North Korea up a little bit, and have them start to embrace more western values, like, uh, human rights, with all the attention focussed towards them.
I thought that maybe the headline was taken out of context, and maybe he was saying that he hoped for a future where North Korea liberalizes and is able to host the World Cup or something like that. But no, the headline is not taken out of context at all. The actual quote is just as stupid as the headline makes it sound.

Yes. Yes. Please God. Make it happen. I want to see the shitshow in all it's glory. I want to see NK vs US. I want to see the horribly constructed stadiums and dorms, the lack of food and hotels, protests, arrests, boycotts... I say Yes!
And assets owned by foreign companies instead of domestic ones, same with a large portion of the few industries there. It's kinda fucked how much we in the developed world benefit from the underdeveloped world existing.
Yes the corruption is a huge problem, but pretending it doesn't benefit us and is atleast to some degree our fault is just wrong.

I’m not saying they are blameless, but you need to realise that people accepting bribes are at least as bad as those offering them. If the government and locals are willing to take bribes then they were already corrupt, they didn’t suddenly become corrupt as a result of the multinationals.

Where specifically are you talking about? Colombia 100% has the capacity to mine gold, people there have been doing so for hundreds of years. The vast majority of the workers in the Chinese owned mines are locals. But the Chinese pay off the government to grant them absurdly profitable land rights, they pay off the guerillas to leave them alone, and they pay off the local police to harass anyone who tries to organize any kind of local activism to stand for the local workers and communities. They offer things like low interest loans or to pay for local infrastructure or environmental treatment plants... then they just don't do any of those things, take the gold and the money, and leave these already impoverished places in even worse shape than they were before, with less resources and more corruption.
they were getting away with occupying Crimea for 8 years, and would have continued to do so if they hadn't gotten greedy.
without the war Ukraine might have had a small chance of recovering Crimea at the eventual death of Putin, if it had led to enough turmoil within Russia, but that's about it.

Combine that with Russia's borderline suicidal aggressiveness elsewhere, and it starts to look like there isn't going to be much left to defend Crimea by the time Ukraine gets there.

I think Iran, North Korea and Cuba are good examples of countries limping along under heavy sanctions or blockades. All three very different countries and they have sought different ways to adapt, but also all "functioning".

It was seen going to St. Petersburg a couple of months ago, to new moorings built there, so I doubt it will go to his Black Sea palace any time soon. Will leave a link to the source in a comment.
Yeah and that was like last month, it's only going to get colder. Ukraine should just wait for them to freeze to death. Pretty messed up that is like genocide by Putin on his own comrades. Pretty dumb to knock out the energy infrastructure when your own troops are freezing to death.
Let's not forget that Putin could end this war tomorrow if he wanted to, the news should make that the headline. Their is no shame in retreating. Even if it is career suicide for Putin, boo hoo.

Putin is getting old and maybe dying. I think he wanted to see some Soviet glory restored in his lifetime, hence the invasion. His goal is nothing less than the annihilation of a non-Russian people and culture. I wouldn't be surprised if he attempted to annex Belarus too before everything is said and done.

Eventually Russia became upset with Finnish independence and invaded them, just (as you said) throwing bodies at the problem. By sheer numbers they forced Finland to concede some territory.

Their military strategy is entirely dependent on manpower, not technology or tactics. They also vastly, vastly overestimate the soft power of Russian culture.
They are still, at their core, organized crime. Fsb, oligarchs are all just various mafia members that report to putin. After ussr, they just rebranded, but the same mafia structure is there. This is super obvious when we look at Moscow vs other 'cities'.
Because it's not Russia. It is hackers based in Russia. As in the hackers might be Russian or located in Russia. But are most likely not state sponsored. So just a criminal hacking operation.

Atleast thats what the article suggests. I wouldnt know why Russia as a state would spend time attacking Australia from all places. But Putin works in mysterious ways lmfao.

True, hence why I keep the option open that the state might have something to do with it. The only thing that makes me think it's purely financial is the current mess the Russian state is in. I can't imagine them using the resources they have on anything other than Ukraine and their allies.

But hey, I am just going by things based on the surface. There might be something to gain from this beyond financial gains. I am sure the Russian state is well aware of the activities of this gang however.
I don't know the situation but from the same article, locals living near the park are getting caught in the effort. I would imagine not everyone is aware of the defined borders of the park and people may be getting shot for simply being in the wrong area.
Not as simple as that, the article goes into detail how the borders of the park aren't clearly defined and innocent people have been shot/killed, including a 7 y.o kid and another kid with mental disabilities. This is also besides the fact that a lot of the people who've been killed have never been identified (or had any forensics work done) so dubious if they were poachers in the first place.

Poachers and their motivations are not monolithic, but the nature and scope of the crime/society they're operating in has led to being shot on sight by those tasked with stopping them.

We probably shouldn’t forget that poachers are specifically there to kill things, and will sometimes kill anything in their way. They aren’t there to pick flowers.

They are extremely dangerous by default. Shooting on sight just makes sense for the safety of anyone who isn’t a poacher.
Friedman has also opposed books like Dear Martin, a book about “an Ivy League-bound African American student named Justyce who becomes a victim of racial profiling.” He said the book should be removed because it promotes “the Black Lives Matter movement” and because it contains “a sense of white guilt in its musings about ‘micro-aggressions’ as elsewhere defined in Critical Race Theory.”.

There are still extreme human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, particularly when it comes to the treatment of migrant workers and the Shia minority, but at least when it comes to women's rights they are on a commendable path. Still a long way to go of course.

People will find a way to be cynical about this. I would say it's a good thing. Saudi is coming from a place of darkness for sure, but there has been real progress for women's rights over the last decade or so.

This is a big thing for Saudi women I hope... there's been some major reforms there lately. It's still an Islamic Monarchy so I'm eager to see how they will follow through as sponsors.

I agree. Changing social norms and public perception takes time and seems they are on the right path. Far from perfect but credits' due for good reforms.
Police in the UK can detain someone at a Police Station for up to 24 hours, and have to apply for an extension of up to 96 hours if that person is under investigation for a very serious offence (namely, murder or similar.).

The chilling effect for me is every dickhead turning up to every incident with a camera, claiming to be press, getting in the way, and police being unable to do anything about it and then being accused of being too "woke" or whatever other nonsense is doing the rounds by then.

If Turkey or Hungary believes the alliance doesn't help them or that the other parties wouldn't honor it then it isn't an equal deal. They are both protected by the US who will defend them if anybody attacks, what do they have to gain from tying their fates with 2 more countries?

Finland being attacked and NATO defending them is more probable then somebody not deciding to attack a NATO member because they are scared of the might of Finland. Some country, lets say a country that borders Finland, might delude themselves into thinking NATO won't protect Finland and attack, not really an impossible scenario.

Russian civilians have no rights in Ukraine and israeli civilians have no right to be in West Bank. It is not Israeli territory and is occupied. Not a single country on the planet recognises West Bank as israeli territory.

And yes, nobody denies the legal right of Russian soldiers to kill Ukrainians, if they're actually defending themselves. Including the people who agree that the Russian invasion is completely illegal, but understand international law. In fact, including the Ukrainians themselves. They aren't arguing that every single Russian soldier that defended himself from a Ukrainian attack is a war criminal.

Israel never officially withdrew from the Oslo accords. If they did, there would be no Palestinian Authority, no Area A/B/C, etc. And indeed, they would gain more rights to employ lethal force all across the West Bank, not less.

It doesn't matter what Netanyahu "boasted about". Just like it doesn't matter that Arafat brazenly violated Oslo by launching the Second Intifada, or that Abbas is brazenly violating it by financially supporting terrorism. It doesn't even matter that Abbas openly said, , that he's withdrawing from Oslo.
It's not reasonable to expect every single article about Trump mention this when that's not the point of the piece. Everyone knows it already anyway. The fact is, and this is a sad truth, almost no one beyond social media cares about 1/6. It doesn't hurt Trump's support at all.
He doesn't have to be popular generally. He just has to be popular enough to win the electoral college, and his opponent has to be unpopular enough to keep voters home. The fact he did win once is enough proof that he can do it again. If voters don't turn out, then Trump can definitely win.

No one should underestimate Trump since he did win once before. He doesn't need to win the popular vote after all. The fact is he's still as popular as ever, not having lost any support at all, whereas Biden doesn't have the same cult following and the economy is still not up to par for most people. Biden has been decent but Americans generally don't like him for one reason or another, usually because of age or inflation, or they just don't care for him. Likely the biggest risk is Dems just not turning out to vote in 2024.

The fact is he's still as popular as ever, not having lost any support at all, whereas Biden doesn't have the same cult following and the economy is still not up to par for most people. Biden has been decent but Americans generally don't like him for one reason or another, usually because of age or inflation, or they just don't care for him. Likely the biggest risk is Dems just not turning out to vote in 2024.
But I do agree about this...Democratic turnout is is the key. Which in a very sick way makes Trump the ideal canidate. The man has done more for Democratic fundraising and turnout than any candidate in history. I feel like your upset prediction is more plausible if a guy like Desantis is the nominee.

I know what you mean. I just think your scenario is actually more likely if another Republican is nominated. Democrats don't take Trump lightly...they hate his guts. The scenario you describe is imho more likely if another Republican gets nominated.

It's probably more of a stretch that a Republican would win the popular vote than it is that a Republican would be the next president. Popular vote doesn't matter at all. Trump lost in 2020 by 43,000 votes. That's what matters.
A significant portion of the homeless population have substance abuse problems or mental health issues along with lacking the income to manage a property. You seize someone elses property and start filling it will homeless what do you think is going to happen? Crime will increase. You address the issue of homelessness by prevention. Reducing cost of living in cities, which no one is willing to do. Helping people who are at risk of becoming homeless. Once someone is Homeless getting them back on their feet is next to impossible.
The best thing for a city is to clear out homeless camps, crack down on property crime and drug use, and disincentivize homeless from traveling to their city.

Filling vacant buildings - part of this can be solved by just giving empty houses to the homeless, it's proven to be more cost effective than any other ways of "dealing with the homeless" this also circles back to the first point.

Most of us know what the solutions are, the problem is our political system is set up in that it wants instant reward, instant results. They want quick fixes and to be honest there isn't one.

infrastructure reform - more pedestrian friendly places, better lighting, public transportation/car alternatives, green spaces (studies have shown decrease in crime and mental health issues by including green spaces near residential areas).
Old school brute force DDoS attacks are very unlikely to be effective in the modern day, no matter how much money you throw at it.
Modern DDoS need to be much more sophisticated to be successful. Most will rely on reflection or amplification techniques rather than brute force, but it's still an ineffective attack method with modern DDoS mitigation techniques.

Not accurate. CloudFlare, for example, provides DDoS protection for pretty cheap and has millions of customers that use it.

I understand how DDoS protection works. It’s something that always intrigued me ever since gaming platform was hit off during holiday (Very sad times). What system is completely DDoS proof? Not trying to be rude, but in csec we never speak in such absolutes. Before I go diving into the theoretical power of a state sponsored cyber warfare unit and imagine what a successful DDoS attack against an enterprise cloudflare client would involve, I have to ask… have you really sat down and thought about it? Are we just disagreeing on what the term “DDoS proof” means?

Is this even a DDOS? Or is it more along the lines of a reddit kiss of death. You have something major happen. People go to the site in mass to figure out what it means. Site ends up with 100x more traffic than what it usually gets and it shits the bed.
Russia hasn’t fought many wars in the past 100 years. Also that time frame excludes the Russo-Japanese War, WWI, and the Polish-Soviet War, which were all pretty embarrassing losses.
What the Russians forgot is that WW2 was a unique situation. Imagine for a moment if America were invaded by demons. These demons killed soldiers, civilians, women, children, babies. They raped teenagers to death. They smashed babies against brick walls to kill them. They burned everything to the ground behind them, and they wanted you to know that they would do the same to you if they got you.

Now, in that context, with tens of millions of dead, with the demons pushing forward towards the last bastions of civilians, if you were a soldier would some landmines be a big deal to you? You're going to hurl yourself at those demons and of everything that could happen to you, being blown up by a landmine is one of the nicer ways to go.

Edit: in short, if you have to clear a minefield under fire and you don't have a mine clearing vehicle with you, you're going to take a lot of casualties.

The minefields that we train for are about 100m deep, so we will need 2 line charges. So some dude needs to run to the start of the minefield, set up the charge and blow a path halfway.

Another dude then needs to rune halfway into the minefield, along the path that was just cleared, set up the 2nd charge to clear the remaining path.
This seems like the kind of thing the CIA and every US government thinks before inserting themselves into a geopolitical mess halfway around the world and messing it up further lol.
Maybe, but the Galwan valley incident happened in 2020, way before the current Ukraine conflict and Russia's reduced standing. I'm pretty sure they're aware of how hard a Himalayan conflict would be as well, and honestly I still don't even know what the result of the earlier skirmish at Galwan was. According to India they killed more Chinese soldiers while according to the Chinese side they killed more Indians. I'm slightly more inclined to believe India, but it's not as though India's government isn't also pretty nationalist - but at the very least they gave us numbers, unlike the Chinese government refusing to even do that. If what India says is true, I would think the Chinese wouldn't be dumb enough to make an even bigger push on that front now.

China wants to fight India like so bad...from the Chinese point of view it's a pretty safe fight China gets to flex it military at a long standing enemy.

So Pakistan and China? I am aware of these wars, but Pakistan is not a world class army, and let's be clear, China in the 60's wasn't the China of today(and there are serious doubts that China can fight even today)and fighting next door is not and indication of quality force projection.
More surpisingly: we're a third of a millenium past that point, aaaaaaaand still doing the exact same shit (but now, with radiation!). Yay.
Holy fuck, that was in 1687! Didn't realize the armies even needed huge ammo dumps like that back then, though it's my bad for not knowing how fast artillery developed in the 17th century and how much its use was expanded.

I'd think that ships wouldn't need large ammo dumps on land, so I wonder what they needed a large dump for, whether it was one huge dump (or one of many), and how they planned on using it.

The cannons themselves weren't exactly mobile until probably Napoleon whose armies made great use of cannons on large wheels.

Ukraine is obviously motivated, and their forces have demonstrated that they have been able to adapt to Western tactics and weapons quickly, so what's holding back support?
I think people feel that if the US and allies just gave Ukraine what they were asking for, the war would be over by now.

That we shouldn't give Ukraine more weapons? That sending weapons to Ukraine is a good investment? That sending weapons doesn't significantly impact our force readiness? Or something else entirely?

"The same could be happening for Ukraine. Even if Ukraine takes back all of its territory it doesnt mean that the war is over, it wouldn't surprise me if we end up in a situation where we have years worth of missiles being thrown at eachother and skirmishes at wherever borders lie at the time.".

Eh. It's unlikely, but a good outcome would be a RF collapse and the independence of many minority groups who have had to endure under the Russians for far too long.

I believe that if Ukraine takes back all their territory, Putin is going to lose power and Russia will be too busy fighting internal struggles to do anything about Ukraine.
I mean, yeah: There are all sorts of creepy issues hovering there in the background. There are all sorts of things that could happen in the future.
There's actually going to be a few more in the coming years. One is going to be around the moon for artemis and if space-x ever gets their starship going it's big enough to be considered a space station all by itself.

And maybe they'll eventually put a nuclear space laser up there, and that will be really scary, but, for now, to me, it's still kind of cool when people go into space for any purpose.

>On the campaign trail ahead of the midterm elections, Fetterman repeatedly vowed to support the end of the filibuster in the Senate if it would allow for key legislation to pass on gun control, labor protections, abortion rights, or voting access.
Also, do you really believe that McConnell and the GOP wouldn't eliminate the filibuster themselves if they retake the Senate and Presidency in 2024 and it was blocking their legislation from becoming law?

If it passes the senate because they got rid of the filibuster and it goes to the house, since dems don’t have the majority, it’ll be less likely to pass since probably no republican will vote for it.

Quite honestly either way if a party can control the house of representatives the Senate and the White House, then they deserve to be able to pass the legislation that they want to pass.

I would hope they would be willing to vote for something given the public pressure, but I feel like they would just be vindictive if they got rid of the filibuster.

If you undo the partisan gerrymandering and voter suppression by eliminating the filibuster for a voting rights bill, then a lot more than half the voters will be voting for Democrats. Republicans have kept the margins incredibly tiny because the filibuster exists, despite the demographics of the country shifting against them.

For Circuit Courts and below, and only because the GOP first decided to refuse to confirm any judges, regardless of their qualifications, because they hated Obama.
In my opinion it is possible that Biden might pull off a Reagan 1984 situation in 2024, where Biden runs the map except for Florida.
Regardless.. the real question isn’t whether Biden can get the necessary 270 over DeSantis/Trump, but by how far a margin Biden wins in 2024.

Name a few candidates who you think will do a better job than Biden, esp in foreign policy. Also, name me under 60 who is electable that is more "in touch." Age doesn't automatically make ppl more in touch w general population. A lot of it comes from their background.

Why do you think our system functioned well before filibuster? We literally had slavery, civil war, and countless social issues. We get rid of filibuster, we are literally dooming ourselves in 2024 when majority of seat up for reelections are democrats.

Ideally once Dems have all 3 branches again they can nix the filibuster and pass a shit ton of popular legislation and not give people a reason to vote for a right wing fascie.

“Nixing the filibuster would get rid of bipartisanship” but yet “Biden doesn’t have the bipartisan support to pass things rn.” If anything nixing the filibuster would force the minority party to negotiate and work with the majority party instead of just blocking every fucking thing. Also Republicans have nixed the filibuster on multiple occasions to get what they want.

The thing to do is to amend the filibuster down to like 55 or make it a talking filibuster again. But even that is incredibly risky given that Republicans could retaliate when they get power and remove it altogether to pass horrible legislation like a nationwide total abortion ban.
Maybe because he is a little more insecure than Agent Orange. For one of your tweets, there are 25 cult members praising how great Musk is. Same for Trump. There are like 200 Bots under every tweet.
The more leave the site, the worse for Musk, the better for everyone. Twitter might have been important but it was molding since a while now and it's not like it's irreplacable. There can be others, not corrupted by Trumps Cronies and Muckus.

Trump is a conservative troll in it for the LULZ, sort of like The Joker. He doesn't care about money and wants Liberals to suffer and cry. That is why he was voted into office in 2016, he was different and didn't care about money like the other politicians and wanted to drain the DC Swamp.

Well my grandfather, god rest his cantankerous soul, used to sit around with his buddies and scheme about how to take back Transylvania from Romania just for shits and giggles. But I mean he was old enough to remember bombs falling on Budapest for the 2.0, so it wasn't surprising.
The issue I have is that US still has an independent media and access to sources on just about any topic they want written in English from around the world. If you only speak Hungarian, your sources of information are very limited indeed.

You’re learning history is Hungary, written by Hungarians. I imagine it’s a lot like how Americans teach the history of chattel slavery in the United States. I encourage you to look more into Hungary’s role in WWII because while it’s dark and hard to imagine, there were so many brave Hungarians who did the right thing and our culture and history is richer for their stories alongside our mistakes.

Does not absolve Hungary of any of its responsibility, actions, or choices made after November 20, 1940. Do not shrug accountability because it was made to seem as if there was a choice. There was no “choice” between Germany or the USSR. It was always Germany, we were beholden to them through awarded territory. Hungary eagerly joined the Axis.
This is great way of looking at it. I roll my eyes whenever I hear people talk about our insignificance in comparison to the vastness of the universe. Yes, we are physically small in comparison to stars and galaxies, but we are also literally the universe observing itself. That’s pretty damn significant, in my opinion, and it’s unique in comparison to the vast majority of “stuff” in existence. Without sentient creatures like us (and any others that might exist), the universe would not even know about itself.
For me personally, the eternal question is where did the universe come from? I understand the big bang but where did any of that come from? Why does anything exist at all?

Just that saying that we are significant due to the amount of atoms in our body isn’t a good way of measuring significance since the scale of the universe (and what can even be considered a “big” number) is unknown.

But conversely, if the fraction of planets that develop life is more tiny than the universe is big, you'd be a fool to believe life is out there. This number is unknown. The fact that the other number is big doesn't tell us how it compares to this unknown number. Very, very big might still not be big enough.

Exactly, all of the bases in RNA and DNA can be produced by lightning strikes in Earth's early atmosphere, and we've known that since 1952, so the proper reaction to discovering them on meteorites is "so what". It's not having handfuls of random amino acids that matters, it's having a naturally occurring process to bootstrap evolution. Graham Cairns-Smith, for instance, wrote a nice book in 1985 outlining how this could theoretically happen through the action of flowing water on clay silicate crystals, the point being not that this definitively happened but that something like that could have happened.

But they don't seem to be self-assembling. Or if they are, the "supportive environment" is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. We don't know how they assemble. Certainly if you put them in a jar and shake it, life doesn't start. Maybe it would if you did that for a billion years, but maybe it needs something fancier than shaking.
"I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I've studied better than anybody, you know it's very expensive. They’re made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here almost none, but they’re manufactured tremendous if you’re into this, tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything.
You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right? Spewing. Whether it’s in ChAIna, Germany, it’s going into the air. It’s our air, their air, everything, right? So they make these things, and then they put em up, and if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters your house is worth 50 percent of the price. They're noisy, they kill the birds.

You know in California they were killing the bald eagle, if you shoot a bald eagle they wanna put you in jail for 10 years. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true! And you know what? After a certain number they make you turn the windmill off, that's true by the way. But this is, they make you turn it off after you, and yet if you've killed one, they put you in jail, but that's OK. But why is it OK for these windmills to destroy the bird population, and that's what they're doing.

Yeah. He legit tried. He praised and kissed the feet of damn near every dictator in the world and boasted about how jealous he was. Don’t get me wrong, the man was still incompetent but he actually tried to steal power and made vague threats and installed yes men in as many political seats as he could. He tried to have Pence removed from the capitol because he wouldn’t play ball and didn’t want him to certify the election.
The EU would need to ‘drive the boat’ for a few years to ensure it won’t just collapse under their feet.
Ukraine should also be wise that if they do get their wish in 2 years though overly optimistic it is, they should do well to protect their agricultural industry and gas/oil from outside private investors who only want to profit, the locals be damned.

At best Ukraine can expect Customs Union in 2 years. 5 years-ish after that single market. A further 3 years full EU membership and possibly Schengen.

And this in the event where Russia does not fall apart and instead become a reasonable partner who hates smuggling and corruption, so they'll presumably put up an attempt to stop it. If not, well, you got the above problem, and actors across the border intent on making things WORSE.

Schengen is not only about visas for Ukrainians. Like I said, there are countries in the EU today who are not in Schengen despite being in the EU for over 15 years, and this is despite the Comission yapping up and down about how much a travesty this is.

It does have things to work on, undoubtedly, but this is beyond criticism - this is an overblown as fuck stereotype, and if Ukrainian politicians dull their teeth after the war - EU will continue dangling membership like a carrot on a stick into the next century. Which you prove perfectly.
So they switched from clear cutting to very carefully regulating when and where lumber in Canada is being cut down. Typically to prevent huge multimillion dollar forest fires.
By cutting down trees and then replanting them responsibly we are able to have a renewable resource.

By all means, log and regrow the new stuff all you want, but those old-growth forests won't grow back in the next 300 years if ever if you destroy enough of the ecosystem they are a part of.

Yes Canada has plenty of trees, but old-growth forests are a whole other matter and deserve preserving, and there is very little left of them.

If you had a clue, you would know that there's a reason why Canada's logging industry has been in decline since the mid 2000s.

Our forest industry is in decline because BC's system of assigning stumpage fees is antiquated and in no way a reflection of the true market prices. This is the same reason that our lumber industry gets sued by the US every few years. Look it up. There aren't fewer lumber mills in north america, they're just all moving to the US.

Southeast US is where the lumber industry is booming. Fewer unions and fairer stumpage prices for producers. All the big Canadian lumber producers, investing hundreds of millions in brand new mills in shitholes like South Carolina or Alabama.
My great aunt, after being confronted with specific unsavory facts about Trump's overt lies, threw up her hands and said, "Oh I thought we were talking politics, if you wanna talk facts I'll have to get back to you.".

But now he's defining the Republican party for them, and forcing them to either agree or disagree with his definition. It's simple in it's premise but so very effective in the execution. By throwing out accusations and theoreticals, he's forcing them to actively define themselves and it hurts them.

Dmitry Yakushchenko surrendered to Ukrainian forces and was returned to Russian forces in a POW exchange on December 1, 2022. There are videos of him in that POW exchange so we know whatever happened to him must have happened in Russia or in parts of Ukraine under Russian occupation.
Russia/Wagner are again trying to intimidate their canon fodder from surrending to Ukrainian forces by making them think that Russia has people in Ukrainian cities to abduct and kill Russian "traitors".

The Russian soldiers invading Ukraine are deliberately bombing hospitals, schools and any other important civilian locations that they can. They are looting the areas that they occupy, and raping and murdering the population. Russians may not be inherently evil, but they sure do seem pretty keen to carry out every war crime and atrocity that they possibly can.

You can be critical of Putin and the war without resorting to lazy stereotypes and racist suggestions that Russians are inherently evil. That's just Cold War propaganda.

As for shooting their own during World War 2, that is a verified fact. “Not one step back” was an offical motto. There’s also “it takes more courage to retreat than to attack”, which was a well known saying in the Red Army due to retreating soldiers being shot or sent to penal battalions.
People point that to a sign that the group is a false flag, but that is ridiculous. Just like Walt Disney's great niece (Roy's granddaughter) publicly calls out Disney for how they treat employees, a descendant can be wealthy from inherited wealth from oil and speak out against it. It is slightly more hypocritical than just giving all their inheritance away, but it is better than nothing.
Making the public actively hate you isn't helpful either though. They don't have to love you, but if they hate you then they may not purposefully hurt the environment (although rednecks do that by rolling coal), but the sure as hell will remember when given the choice of putting in effort to help the environment or doing less work and hurting it (such as holding onto a bottle to recycle it or throwing it out in a nearby trashcan).

We need more protests like this one. Governments STILL aren't doing enough to mitigate the effects of climate change, so we need MORE PRESSURE like protests that block roads and fossil fuel business entrances. Only REAL PRESSURE that affects the economy is going to work, because most politicians only care about money. They don't care about normal peaceful protests that don't disrupt anything. They ignore those protests because those politicians being bribed by the fossil fuel industry. The only way for us to overcome the power of bribery is to prevent the fossil fuel industry from making money to make those bribes. It's time for the fossil fuel industry to pay for all the damage it has done to the planet and everyone's health. If our governments won't make them pay, we should make them pay by disrupting their businesses. Our survival depends on it.
I also want to chime in that in my experience, many of these people can't recognize that people might think differently than them for any good reasons.
Similarly, an old coworker of mine thinks Leftists and Dems are part of an insidious cabal or have secret intentions because, to paraphrase, "no one believes or wants that hippy dippy commie shit, and if they do then they're brainwashed.".

So much this. Really saw that demonstrated when COVID hit. People thought that if they didn't "believe in COVID" then it wouldn't hurt them or something. I just don't understand people like that.

They can’t understand that a man (or a woman) can be so many other things and it does not affect them one bit. Gay men can be masc or femme, they can be drag queens or jocks or anything in between. Trans people existing does not affect a cis person at all. But they’re so hopelessly attached to these old binaries and changing that scares them so much, even when it has nothing to do with them.

They’re also deeply fearful people. My brother is one of these fascists and was very anti-mask/anti-vax. He would keep telling me that my boyfriend and I need to stop living in fear. My boyfriend literally works with infectious diseases and primarily works on treatments/cures for many of them. All of that experience was lost on my brother and he interpreted basic precautions we took in 2020/2021 for fear. It took too long for me to realize that he was the one afraid and the masks and vaccines were reminders that there was a global pandemic and that was too scary for him. They can’t accept that no one is truly in control because that chaos frightens them. So they turn to strongmen and authoritarians who claim they can fix it. They cannot understand that others do not live their lives in constant fear. Fascists are some of the weakest and most fearful people I’ve ever met.
Unsurprising result, and the SNP will continue to push for it and push nationalism and such to promote it. Realistically it would be like Britain voting for Brexit all over again but that's not going to stop them.
Also happened in Ecosse before the Brexit (when England knew they would win). I'm sure it has happened recently in other countries.

I'm refering to the Brexit because the main argument for England was that Ecosse leaving UK also meant leaving EU. Just the folowing year, England decided to organize the Brexit referendum. In Scotland "remain" won, but they were forced by England to exit EU anyway.

Scotland got their chance at independence and chose to stay a part of the UK. This was recent. There are no obligations under UK or international law to keep giving them re-do's.

Sorry that's not how international law works. Spain, and throw in the rest of the EU, will not allow Scotland to join unless the independence process goes smoothly and with the consent of the entire UK.

There are probably several other countries that would not allow EU membership unless the process is smooth and has the clear consent of the entire UK.

Spain will never allow Scotland to join the EU unless the process is completed in full accordance with UK law. They're quite clear and on the record with this stance.

The House Republicans and their conservative Wing are going to act like a monkey throwing shit at the wall for the next two years. They are going to pass bill after Bill that will take a spin through the Fox News cycle and then take a Second Spin through the news cycle when they die in the senate.

Then when the bill dies in the Senate Fox News will spend some time talking about how obviously the Democrats want to let IRS SWAT teams raid people's houses. If the Democrats are smart they will adopt Mitch McConnell's strategy of Simply never taking votes on these bills.

For the wealthy and Powerful the status quo is almost always the most profitable situation. When the system changes you have to spend new money and jockey with other people to try to get your position settled in the new system.
but on this one? this is disgraceful. these 20 are halting the business of the government so that they can try to force things to be passed that republicans were unable to pass when they had larger majorities and the senate (things like term limitations and a balanced budget act.) if they could not get them when they had large majorities, how are they supposed to get them now when they have essentially no majority in 1 part of 1 of the 3 branches?
gaetz, beobert, et al are a disgrace. they are turning the republican party into a national embarrassment. they are trying to justify this by playing to a tiny part of their base.

>Holding cops who have been found guilty of misconduct accountable is an issue several states have tried to address head-on. States like California, Virginia, and Massachusetts have passed laws allowing them to decertify an officer, essentially ensuring that their record of bad behavior follows them if they try to find a job in law enforcement elsewhere in the country.
This approvals step requires that it is proven that the crime is related to their work as a police officer, and that it is either "gravely injurious to the interests of the State", or "liable to lead to serious loss of confidence in the public service" i.e. even very serious crimes unrelated to their work won't result in a pension being forfeit.

As for the moral argument around whether this is a slippery slope with respect to 401k's etc., I'd ask the question of how this is any different from a fine payable over many years? It is still a financial penalty relating to a crime you have been sentenced for.

well the issue is convicted criminals on duty. If i committed a crime outside of my work purview then I would still get a pension but if I did it related to my work, then I wouldn't.

They should get the money they paid in and any interest generated but they should lose out on the pension.

These people paid into their pension system, and may not deserve it but it was their money. Instead of just taking a pension, if a crime has been committed and a victim identified restitution is a better play in my opinion. pensions should be protected FULL STOP.
Except the lender in this case is the Federal government... I don't know if private student loans are different but that's not what this case is about since the Fed obviously can't discharge private loans through a private lender.
My guess is she didn't qualify for Federal loans and had the bright idea to get private loans and her education didn't pan out sadly.

Yes, that's how this relief works. The Federal Government is the lender and can dictate and modify how much is owed. The money received from students paying the loans just kinda goes into the budget only to be sent out with new student loans.

in case you’re one of the “uneducated” there are a number of programs that forgive student loans. Also this doesn’t forgive the whole loan only up $10k.

It’s fine if you don’t agree with his view on student loan forgiveness. I certainly don’t. But let’s not start making PPP loans some kind of boogeyman. Lots and lots of small (even tiny) businesses got them. They were never loans, really - everyone knew it was free money.
Trump just said the quiet parts of traditional Republican doctrine, out loud. He connected with those too stupid to understand dog whistles. If he goes it alone, they get to publicly sanitize their reputation without changing anything.
But you want him to take "his" idiots, like MTG, with him. Unfortunately it's bigger than Trump - you need to remove Trumpism too. We've seen just how many craven politicians are following that playbook around the world.

On the other hand, one party rule for a decade would do a lot to get the country, especially the Supreme Court, back on track. Maybe that period would end with the formation of a Progressive Party. Think about that, if the choice in every Senate and Presidential election was between a Democrat and a Progressive, and the Republican rump was confined to a handful of House seats.

As an Arizonan, I'm not concerned if the town of Pine sends a crazy to the state house. They be crazy up there.

Mailed ballots sent in before Monday/Tuesday are counted first. State statute (guess who made that law) says you have to count e-day votes before early ballots dropped off on election day.

The delay in results here is mostly from early ballots dropped off on election day. 290k in Maricopa County alone. There are also batches of ballots that were processed, but have yet to be counted, that were dropped off right before ED.

I am sure that Russia will offer to hold another referendum if the situation at the front becomes dangerous in order to find out the "opinion" of Crimeans, who will soon be less than half in Crimea and show the whole world that Crimeans love Russia.

To be honest, as a person who was born and grew up here, at first everyone was happy about joining Russia, but when the Russian reality entered the lives of Crimeans, many were very disappointed. No one had ever thought of joining Russia before, but Russian propaganda was very active in Crimea and everyone thought that the revolution of 2014 would lead to a large number of victims.

I will say one thing for sure - no matter how the news about the weakness of air defense in Russia is written, its concentration in the Crimea is so large that not a single drone will fly.
Like, this does need to be said also.... If you are a white, straight, cis dude under the age of 50 or 60, and these fascists fucks take power; it will directly effect you in your lifetime.
Like, Martin Niemoller, of the "First they came" poem, was a protestant minister that was the wrong sect of protestantism in a largely protestant fascist project. If they win and no longer have to worry about opposition; even if the tension of possible civil war between left and right goes away; they will still drag the country into a civil war as they turn on each other, and it will not be pretty. More than likely, they will chop the U.S. into pieces to better control (as smaller sovereiy is inherently easier to control and use to oppress) and sink into a sort of cold religious war as they force entire swaths of regions to convert to their specific brand or die.

You know who protestants/evangelicals hate more than gays, POC, trans people and women? Catholics. You know who catholics hate more than those things? Protestants/evangelicals. It's harder to tell with the protestants because they're more decentralized, but you can see how it is with how the extreme catholics talk amongst themselves about Vatican II. They fucking hate that they ceded their claim to supreme authority in order to find common cause with other sects of Christianity and remain politically relevant. They fucking hate that they revoked blaming all Jews for the death of Jesus. Evangelicals hate that its Leonard Leo picking supreme court seats and Newt Gingrich and Sean Spicer and all those fucks make pilgrimages to the Vatican. Paul Gosar denounced the pope for "trendy socialist speak.".

They fucking hate that they revoked blaming all Jews for the death of Jesus. Evangelicals hate that its Leonard Leo picking supreme court seats and Newt Gingrich and Sean Spicer and all those fucks make pilgrimages to the Vatican. Paul Gosar denounced the pope for "trendy socialist speak.".
This is the point I was trying to make. If you wanna be an asshole and fuck over everyone who isn't a cishet white male, I don't know how to convince you that you should care about other people except to say I hope you're treated with the same kindness.
The French (weirdly, given their ability to produce arms) routinely spend way below their obligation as a NATO member, each member state is supposed to spend 2% GDP on Defence. France rely on American forces in region, as most European countries do tbh but they can, because America spends so much.
We are a European nation that's constantly trying to be dependent on the US instead of working with our close neighbours. Sticking with the Eurofighter would mean we would have a lot more planes for the money spent than trying to swap to the F35, France also has a great defence industry that we could have collaborated on an IFV together and likely got a better product faster than we did doing it in house. It also means if war breaks out, parts and technicians aren't across an entire ocean, but just the channel. Also collaborating closer to home means that both countries can benefit from the production as parts can be made in both creating jobs for everyone, rather than exporting more jobs to the US in the case of the F-35.

I didn't know that about the carriers, another waste of money then I guess. Also the Chally 2.1 is just another example of the MOD being far to incompetent to get anything done, these tanks should have been getting continuous upgrades since their release like the Abrams does, and don't get me started on the fact we have a rifled main gun still.

On the tank front they are just upgrading the challengers instead of making a new product, this is already long overdue and should have been getting done since the tanks deployment.

The British army are about to receive the 1st of their 4th gen tank the Challenger 3, which no one has any actual knowledge of it's capability yet, but is touted to be the most advanced battle tank on the market. So maybe he's talking shit? Lol.
Lets be honest, shootings will only be allowed whin in danger OR there are no cameras present. If someone is shot, deny it. Then say Palestinians did it. Then say militarily needed, no matter the circumstance. And anyway, even if found guilty, worst is some community service and a smack on the wrist with a soft rag.
Even America, which is a huge apologist for Israel is pissed at the land grab of the illegal settlements. No there is not a war. As far as I know Palestine has no military. If people being shoved around fight back, that is not a war. And, exactly why in a section of Palestine, why are there more Israelis than Palestinians?

even the concept of a palestinian country/nation only took form after Zionism started. This says to me, the idea of a palestinian state is not something that was desired by the palestinians, as much as them wanting what the other "kid" was getting. If the palestinian desire for nationhood was so strong, why did it never make an attempt to come into being?

Your country is a moral thing to fight for, but as I mentioned, Palestine was not a country. Nor to be honest (and being honest I will admit i have not looked into this exhaustively), do I know what is unique about Palestinian culture or nation, as opposed to Syria, lebanon, jordan, or egypt.

I suppose I am questioning the strenh of purpose, of being of a palestinian state if it only exists in opposition to something, as opposed to being founded/desired on it's own inherent principles and values. Do they say "we need an identity opposed to the Israeli one, so if Israel has a country we want/deserve one", and so they only define themselves in opposition to Israel, no Israel, no palestinian identity.

And this is where things get dicey, because by this point the locals in the once-more-stateless land were still openly hostile to Israel (who, reminder, occupied it in a defensive war), but they wanted to become their own independent state. Israeli politicians at the time supported this notion, but on the condition that it would come as a result of negotiations with an elected body representing the Palestinians (unlike the "representatives" who were appointed for them by the Arab League when the UN was forming the partition plan).

There are still plenty of left wing Israelis who hope for a peaceful two state solution, but history since the Oslo Accords has made it more and more difficult for them to gain any traction in government.

A great proof for this, is that every time we had a liberal government, a peace treaty in process, any real progress towards ending the conflict, there would be a wave of terror attacks at the heart of israel's cities, which would snuff out any hope for co existence in israeli civilians which vote for more right wing politicians that promise to restore safety. Israel's left wing is almost non existent since the events of the second Intefada.
Political winds changed and Argentina followed the checklist of all of the things modern economics understands to cause and exacerbate inflation. They've defaulted on public debt 3 times in the last 20 years with entirely predictable results. The defaults caused economic pain because it increased the cost to borrow. They tried to solve the economic pain with major tax cuts for workers and greatly increased public spending. Doing that when the cost of borrowing skyrockets is not the best idea. The result was just as you'd predict.
It's not that hard to imagine a scenario where this turns into a showdown. Fast forward a bit where we aren't dealing with the politics of right-now. Brazil might say that they don't have the money to protect the Amazon and that the US should foot the bill. Absent money from the US, they will not enforce efforts to stop deforestation. The US might be in a place where it is not politically feasible to pay Brazil to protect the Amazon. It's not unimaginable that the US responds with threats of sanctions to compel Brazil to fund the protection of the Amazon itself. While that seems like a clear abuse of sanctions today and would be unimaginable today, what's to say that it won't be seen that way in a few years?

Yes the dollar is mighty and who knows, maybe printing howmuch you want wont de-stabilize your economy.
I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility that a sizable portion of the house could not even explain what they are voting on, what the potential fallout is and what that actually means in reality. To a lot of them it’s probably like Covid or climate change- an abstract concept, and they think it’s being over blown to boot. These are the people that did and do still support trump and listen to his word salad and think “Yeah that makes sense, and I will follow this man”. Also as far as I know this has t happened before, at least not in loving memory. Like a malicious child with a hot stove they aren’t going to even really truly believe that something bad can happen until reality beats them over the head with it.
Did you watch any of the speaker debates? It’s not just Bobo and Marge. Half these morons couldn’t form a coherent statement that was purely political fluff that they had an opportunity to sit down and write.

They've been pulling this childish shit for decades, so there will be no compromise with the Dems as per their stupid fucking "rule".

Problem is the House Republicans play by the unbelievably juvenile Hastert "rule" which says they will only pass a bill if it can pass with Republican votes alone. Considering their razor thin majority, that will be neigh impossible in most cases.

I was lucky during the big shutdown in 2013, because I worked as a contractor in a DoD facility that was deemed essential, and my contract had enough funding already allocated that they could continue to pay us for the time being, since it was disbursed in 3 month increments or something like that. Had we been close to the end of that period when the shutdown happened, or had it gone on past that date, I'd have been in just as bad of a bucket as all of my military and government civilian coworkers, who had to show up for work and weren't getting paid, while still having bills to pay.
There's one Democratic State Senator who proclaims himself "strongly pro life" so with 21-19, the Republicans could've had the Lt Gov break a tie, potentially, if they got him to sign on.

Just curious: the article implies that even had this gone the other way, Democrats would still have a 21-19 majority in the state Senate. Does this mean there are Democrats who are anticipated to vote in favor of an abortion ban? That honestly seems like a pretty tone-deaf move in a moderate state right now...
So one of the interesting side-effects of the war in Ukraine is that it has shone a light on just how deeply corruption is established in the various Russian military arms and just how poor their equipment readiness is.
One of the biggest reasons Russia has poorly maintained conventional forces is because they have spent billions in updating their nuclear arsenal, Russia knows they would never be able to win a conventional war with NATO so why would funnel money and resources into it?

Russia on average spends 15-17% of their defense budget on nuclear weapons, one of the reasons their conventional forces are so neglected, they could never compete with nato conventionally, they know this, so why waste money on it.

One of the big reasons Russias army is in shambles is because Russia spends much more on updating and maintaing their nuclear forces, Russia knows it wouldn't be able to fight a conventional war against NATO, even if they did pour a ton of money into their army/conventional forces, they would get squashed, So they spend their defense budget on the only thing that they CAN go toe to toe with NATO on, and that's Nuclear weapons.

Sure nobody wants Russia to be capable of causing a massive devastating / country ending nuclear strike but unfortunately they do have that capability if they didn't, I can guarantee you that NATO would have put a stop to this a long time ago.

That's not to say that can't fail, too, but Putin definitely understands it, and while he might want to test the boundaries, I seriously doubt he actually wants to be the guy to cause all out nuclear war.

However, use of a nuke on Ukraine means there is a nuclear-armed regime that is willing to use them in pursuit of conquest, rather than as a deterrent, and that's a major red line.

TL;DR NATO Article 5 is not a necessary condition for a devastating US response if Russia uses nukes in Ukraine. But such a Russian attack could trigger NATO article 5 anyway if radiation from Russian aggression drifts across the border into any NATO country.

Now if Russia attempts a general nuclear strike, that WILL trigger Article 5, and I'd expect Russia to pay in kind for every successful detonation. If a warhead detonates in a suburb of Paris... well then the French will ensure Moscow rides the whirlwind (they will have to).
He's trying to keep the message alive and a priority. But if the terrorist attacks on civilian targets are allowed to continue without a direct response, Putin will feel empowered to continue and escalate. NATO is afraid of escalation, but they are encouraging the same by not responding as Russia does.
People like you were saying a year ago that Putin wouldn't attack Ukraine, and that any reports of such an invasion were fear-mongering.

Putin thrives on weakness, and he is a gambler. Every time he is not confronted with serious push-back, he ups the ante. In his twisted mind, NATO is a paper tiger. He believes he has been proven right on many occasions, when he did insane things and saw almost no consequences. Following that logic, if he is not stopped in Ukraine, he will keep pushing. First the Baltics, then perhaps Poland.

Baltic states - possibly. Poland unlikely, it wasn't part of the USSR which Puta is trying to recreate. Either way, Russian aggression must be stopped now, without waiting for their further steps.
The truth is you can say anything you want, but they also don't want any responsibility for the consequences of their speech. Any response to their speech is considered not free speech.
There’s a difference between the principle of free speech and the first amendment. The latter is for what you described, but the former is the broader belief that we should have a society that fosters free and open discussion of ideas. Most of the values we hold today started out as unpopular minority opinions, and I think we lose something as a society if we move in the direction of those opinions being suppressed. I say this with absolute certainty that nothing MTG has to say will contribute to society in any way whatsoever. I just think it’s important to remember that freedom of speech as an ideal is broader than the first amendment.

Lets not use Twitter. Also, delete your info from it. Using that platform is giving him power and money, which he could use to get more of both.
But I saw a post on conspiracy where they claimed it was big media making up the lie about very fine people..Even though there was like, ya know, video of him saying this.
I'll give you a hint you dense loaf of bread: Trump says what needs to be said in interviews, but when he actually acts, he's a hugely racist piece of shit. Keep deepthroating the Trump boot though, yall are doing great with the streak of election losses.

It's really quite a big deal that Trump is such a loser. We should all keep in mind that he's a loser. And he lost to sleepy Joe, which really highlights just how much of a loser he is.

There are far too many solid Republican candidates to choose from to worry about Trump. Yes he has a fired up base, but can that base carry him out of the primaries. No, his time is past. Ron DiSantis is the future of the Republican party.

Not that you should be fair to Christie (he's not a great person), but he's one of the few GOP members that have been consistently critical of trump and trumpism. Likely why you don't hear much of him now lmao.
The article uses a lot of insider lingo that doesn't clearly explain the situation to the masses. I'd love for someone who understands FIFA's regulations better to comment on this.
Ok, dumb American question here: Why does FIFA have so much power over Football? Couldn't a group of major nations that are fed up with them simply create another organization to manage their collective Football leagues? I get that it would splinter the football world but if say a few dozen major nations and several aligned smaller ones bailed on FIFA how long would it last? I know the NFL has an enormous amount of power as well but would never get a way with the shit FIFA does.

Yeah it sucks, as much as I love football FIFA is ridiculously corrupt and I do not want to support them in any way. I boycotted the World Cup and basically only know what happened through news articles, probably gonna keep doing that for the foreseeable future because they are just so goddam crooked.

Back in 2016 it came out that the single biggest donation source to the trump campaign of the 2016 election was Vince himself, using his own personal, non company affiliated money. Only problem with that line of logic js, all his money COMES from money he pays himself with the WWE profits.

So the way I see it, if I watch WWE and give them profits, then I'm responsible for trumps next donation. And if you watch FIFA, YOU are responsible for the next great atrocity that they pull. The next corruption we find out about.

I am hesitant to enjoy seeing the infighting; reminds me too much of how the Republican Tea Party started.
It's sad that in the Republican Party it always seems to be extremists pulling the party to the right. And in the Democratic Party it always seems to be moderates pulling the party to the right.

To be fair, the republicans aren’t pulled right. Their messaging has always pushed their voters further right. If your message is constantly going on about crime and violence, people will eventually become primed for violence. They’ve been doing exaggerations to win elections since Reagan. No longer was it a debate firmly on ideas, it was insidious sophistry.

Nothing ever plainly said anymore. The normal people can’t see plainly who the nazis are bc they’ve all made their language politically correct to not sound any alarms. They won’t say Jews, they’ll say “George Soros.” They won’t say trans people, they’ll say “drag queen strippers.” They won’t say gay people, they’ll say “groomers.” So when the left calls it out, we look insane. And the dem party doesn’t help bc the Dem party is rife with corpo money corruption, so of course they jump on it to further purge the party of leftists who would refuse corpo money.

Bc in a civil war there are traitors, those who betray the established order. That, at least by those in power, is how its seen. So they’re calling those who oppose McCarthy, traitors to the party basically. A republican civil war where its corporate first fascists versus Christian fascists.
Also gets complicated. If they use an active hospital or school to shoot from, it becomes a “legitimate” target and if civilians die in the process it’s not a war crime.

>At the New Beginnings Church in Irving, Texas, in August 2012, Cruz delivered a sermon where he described his son's senatorial campaign as taking place within a context where Christian "kings" were anointed to preside over an "end-time transfer of wealth" from wicked people to the righteous. Cruz urged the congregation to "tithe mightily" to achieve that result. ().

But even if she doesn’t, watching him spread hate and talk about LGBT people like they’re evil child molesters— that’s still dangerous talk coming from him.

Every time he says something bad about gay people or the LGBTQ community, that daughter hears it as an attack on her. She must be hurting so much. That’s terribly sad.

Everyone should get to share what they want, when they want to, and not be forced into anything. This poor girl must really be struggling.

In all seriousness though, Ted Cruz's dad is also a piece of shit. Here's a bit from his Wikipedia page:
1. Capture Bakhmut at all costs (even though it'd just be another Mariupol-style destroyed city with no value by the end of it.).
3. Use that as propaganda cover for withdrawing from parts of the Kherson and Zap oblasts (I suspect, west of Oleski/Crimea Water Canal, and north of Nova Kakhovka/M14 road, which would include giving up the ZNPP.).

2. Push back Ukraine from the outskirts of Donetsk/Luhansk, to ensure major Russian-held cities are out of range of Ukrainian artillery. This was a goal from day 1, but the Ukrainian defenses along the Toretsk-Avdiivka-Mariinka line have proved virtually impenetrable. The fall of Bakhmut might provide encirclement opportunities, or at least flanking pressure that could make Ukraine withdraw from their most fortified positions in the entire war. I don't think Russia has any steam left to take Slovyansk/Kramatorsk, their current goal is a border lying somewhere roughly equally between Donetsk/Luhansk and those cities.

Not saying Putin would manage to accomplish that (Ukraine has a good chance of pushing Russia out of the entire Kherson and Zap oblasts, all the way to the Crimean border), but these I think are the current plans.

Pretty sure Svatove is the new Kherson where they do a protracted interdiction campaign that doesn't capture much territory but degrades the Russians to the point they pull out all at once.

This is all about the promotion of Yevgeny Prigozhin, and its seemingly telling that no one within the Russian command structure has been able to resist the move and point out how strategically insignificant it is. Presumably Putin has signed off on it too, which makes me wonder if he's concerned a bit as well. can't afford to alienate Prigozhin.
Putin is basically baiting the Ukranians into a stronghold area where the defenders will have the advantage, and they aren't stupid enough to fall for it.
The Ukrainians are rejecting this as a ploy to set a trap. There has been no real movement of troops out of the area: instead, the Russians are embedding and doubling down with supplies. Putin is basically claiming "Oh Hai everyone we are just leaving and you should too The Ukranians will be here soon oh noes".

The fact that Putin himself is taking the responsibility of telling people to leave the city has me worried. It makes me think he might use a tactical nuke there, or is another commenter mentioned, he might blow the dam and flood that whole area.

Man, I've got a bad feeling about this. Normally these evacuations and retreats happen almost after the fact and Putin never talks about them.

As horrible as blowing that damn would be, I really don't want him to use the tactical nuke. That sends the whole world into uncharted territory, and I don't think I have enough canned food stored up to survive a nuclear winter.
California is the most ethnically diverse states in the United States - which is what the DNC is trying to achieve, reach a better consensus of candidate and appeal to more than white Democrats.
White Democrats have distinctly different priorities than minority Democrats or Independents, which the Democrats need to win state and nation wide elections.

Not all southern democrats are conservative, they can be more moderate but they believe in many of the things progressives do, but they care about who can actually win a general election to try and get the shit we all want.

Qatar literally owns more of London than the Queen. They’re one of the richest countries in the world, and they also produce the most CO2 emissions. They brought in a bunch of migrant workers, seized their passports, and made them put up the stadium in extreme conditions leading to hundreds of deaths. You have to wonder, what exactly is the real reason FIFA decided Qatar of all place$?
“Let me first assure you that every decision that is taken in this World Cup is a joint decision between Qatar and FIFA,”.

A company in an instance like this should have no legal protections from being obligated to fulfil their word as though it were a binding contract; the employees and executives should have no fiduciary duty to lie to the general public in any case, even if this is damaging to the company's income; and such representatives of the company should have no legal protections against lawsuits if they do lie.
Unfortunately, the world we live in is one where a company is expected and required to lie to the general public if this is in any way advantageous to the shareholders of the company, and even outright breaking the law is required of executives if doing so will increase corporate profits.

since our legal system is insufficient to require or even promote good behavior on behalf of corporations, it falls to private citizens to punish them for their moral failures.

You need a moral majority (preferably with an empowered government) to constrain capitalist organizations to moral standards, by making it artificially more expensive to be immoral than moral. Unicorns are slightly more effective at this, however, due to their existence being somewhat less implausible than the former.

Yup. Capitalism is neither inherently moral nor immoral; it is amoral, and its only real tenet is "more money is better".

It IS immoral, to anyone who cares about society. Capitalism doesn't give a flyin' anything about society, though. In capitalism, even if the world is descending into destruction, as long as you have the most money, you're winning (and getting more money means more winning).
Canadian here, an auditor here who happened to be mormon went public with the fact that the tithe he and all his church members are paying in canada was going straight to the mormon colleges in the US. Nothing was staying in the local community. Churches are a scam and need to pay taxes.
Tax fraud on this religion? Nahhhh. They don’t pay taxes on anything. I think they really are just being compliant with the tax laws and how they work for a recognized religion.

I think to avoid any favoritism, the IRS should agree to audit the books of the Top 100 religious institutions (based on assets) in the USA. From LDS to Catholic Church to Scientology. No favoritism.

This is very well reasoned and correct. I think the outrage has to do with the intersection of the spirit of the law and the desire that tithing be used to help as many as possible today.

Hahaha It’s okay to rant but as far as educated people within a religious structure you can guess the number of Jews, Catholics (the majority of the Supreme Court is Catholic), Episcopalians and Presbyterians that all have highly educated elite attorneys and accountants among their ranks.
It is assumed that over five years, due to a separate program for Ukraine, "significant funds in the amount of billions" of NOK will be allocated. In 2023, the amount will be divided equally between military and civilian support, including reconstruction.
Former director of the CIA, commander of the American group in Iraq, General David Petraeus, in an interview with The Washinon Post, spoke about a possible scenario of the return of Crimea by Ukraine.

"If Ukraine can completely isolate Crimea and if it has high-precision munitions, it will be able to start shelling the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, various air bases, various seaports and everything else, and then at some point enter the territory of Crimea," Petraeus shared the forecast.

A Ukrainian incursion of Sevastopol, an attack behind Russian lines on the small stretch of land that separates Kherson Oblast from the Crimean peninsula, or even an attempt to cut supply lines to the Russian forces attacking Kherson would require the Russians to move troops West really fast which would cost them in other sectors.
There is plenty of discussion about this in Germany but two points to consider that are mentioned in the headline:
The law requires that these crimes are denied as to incite hatred and violence so no, no-one is going to be jailed for nor knowing whether Hiroshima was a warcrime or not.

If the law is against denying certain historical events, how can it be worded in a way that only applies to inciting violence? Maybe they should call it "violence incitement law" instead of "war crime denial law".

If the law really is written "just like" that, why is it a "Holocaust denial" law and not a "violence incitement law" then? Why does it (appear to be?) concerned with why someone incites violence? Is it OK to incite violence if it isn't based on denying atrocities or discrimination against a minority group?

Normally I would provide some of my own explanation, but you should just watch all of that if you care about having your facts straight about war crimes and genocide. Which you should.
Trump was a rabid dog that barked. Desantis is a rabid dog that bites. Desantis is worse than Trump by orders of magnitude.
Trump is going to very publicly destroy DeSantis by accusing him of every awful thing Trump has ever done. DeSantis is an absolute dogshit human being, and there is next to zero probability he doesn't have some truly horrible skeletons in his closet and Trump is going to expose them, embellish them, invent them entirely.

And I, for one, am here for it. Fuck both of them. Trump's complete lack of concern for anyone but himself is going to be one hell of an asset. Remember, Trump still thinks he needs to become president again to avoid jail time. He will say or do anything to make that happen. He does not care whatsoever if this scorched earth campaign destroys the GOP or the world, really, for that matter.

DeSantis can't actually punch Trump too hard. If he actually attacks Trump, it will have to be for things that DeSantis is either guilty of himself or has previously defended Trump for. Trump will retaliate for every perceived slight with the most heinous shit we've ever heard.
What it will look like is that one crazy teacher (every school has one) that will out their own Christianity in the classroom and shove it full-bore down the throats of children as part of their daily routine. In high Christian (rural American) areas, students that do not adhere will be othered by peers, and the school will have very little recourse to help them navigate the problem.
Teachers overwhelmingly do not want prayer in schools, and overwhelmingly enjoy and care about children enough to not perpetrate the kind of discrimination you are suggesting. At the point that they are watching prayer and ticking off names on a clipboard is the point at which the line of religious fascism is far behind us.

They are singling out atheism as being a problem while literally trying to force their way into public schools to indoctrinate other people's children. I hope they are ready for the Satantic Temple to be in their schools. Imagine the pearl clutching when that happens.
The lack of paying anyone definitely doesn't help him, but Trump cannot be truthful to save his life. Literally. He doesn't lie strategically. He lies impulsively, and he has no memory of what he's already lied about in the past.
All politicians lie, obviously, but usually they do it strategically. They do it towards a goal. They do a risk calculation before telling a lie to figure out if the risk is worth the reward. This is, if not ethical, very normal behavior.

If he were anyone else other than a wealthy white asshole with a giant silver spoon up his asshole and political power thanks to his remarkable ability to rouse the most simple and gullible people in the country, he'd be in jail on so many different charges that he'd never see the light of day even if he were immortal.

I mean, the world's biggest fuckup became president, lived an opulent life at the taxpayers' expense, has the worshipful adoration of a hundred million people and leadership of one of two major parties, and seems to have committed some major crimes without much of a consequence so far. I feel like his younger self might have seen all this and learned the lesson that lying is awesome. It's certainly working for Trump, even if there might be a horizon dimly visible now where he has real legal problems.
To sum it up: the conservative justices won the vote over the liberals 5-4. The plaintiffs will continue to have their 1st amendment rights undermined for the foreseeable future.
Kagan dissented saying that there were established tests that could be used by the courts to easily determine which maps to strike down, that gerrymandering is far more of an issue today than it was historically because of new extremely precise methods of gerrymandering, and because it was the role of the court to defend the most basic foundations of democracy in our country by striking down extreme partisan gerrymandering.

by federal courts. State courts can still consider political gerrymanders based on state election laws and state constitutions. Not agreeing with the Supreme Court, but it does mean and we have seen in some states ballot measures to make political gerrymanders illegal/unconstitutional.

Why isn’t your Supreme Court not concerned with ensuring fair and equal access and representation for voting? Taking a marker out and redrawing boundaries to suit your party should raise a red flag in any properly functioning democracy.
We’re getting a whack job for speaker no matter who prevails from the hate group known as the GOP. Let themselves keep looking like idiots in the meantime.
Get fucked with this stupid opinion. The republicans can back a "centrist" dem. Tired of the Democrats having to be the ones to compromise, especially in cases like this, where its entirely the fault of the GOP for being such a cluster fuck.

What a shit take anyone seriously saying democrats should work with Republicans over this are either Republicans themselves or morons. All democrats should do is sit back and keep voting Jeffries, let Republicans solve their mess afterall they have the majority and therfore the votes/mandate right?

If we want to make hypothetical with them that we can be sure benefit Dems, why not get just a few House Republicans to vote present, allowing for Jeffries majority to win out? That's a deal we can depend on and one that might actually stand a better chance of happening.

Because the minute a Dem influenced Speaker vote becomes a real possibility is the minute the GOP rallies around McCarthy.

Also, the problem at hand is that McCarthy isn't extreme enough for some Republicans, and all the other GOP members are trying to rally behind the guy with the most votes. Suggesting the Dems put forward a moderate Republican will satisfy neither of those groups of people.

Can I ask what McCarthy has done to earn so much of your trust here? Or is this just a matter of "why not try it, what's the worst that could happen" for you?
John Boehner had a 30+ seat majority with a more moderate caucus and he got run out of town by the freedom caucus. He was also a better politician than McCarthy. This will be interesting.
Interesting to hear you say that. I was wondering why it was Scalise announcing the GQP legislative agenda a few days ago. Made McCarthy look weak before he started.

McCarthy is already caving to the Freedum Cacus for their vote. Even if he gets speaker you know that caucus will make him grovel to him before any house decision. Kevin will go along with their crazy in order ti get their votes, their crazy will get worse and that will cause even more intense party infighting.

It is now that the GOP is getting the House, but the law is the law. Trump should’ve been indicted ages ago, anyone else would’ve been. The 4D Chess “bigger picture” is a dangerous canard and Orwellian.

Sorry but Mueller did not do his job. If anything all he did was reinforce the ridiculousness of the Republican Party. Given that the justice department operates independent of influence of the president, it also shouldn’t have mattered who was president. He uncovered a crime and chose to uphold a crooked justice department standard of not charging a sitting president while ignoring all the other justice department standards that hurt trump. If we knew what mueller knew I have a feeling some of us might be obligated out of sense of duty to mankind to tell the world just how bad things were to prevent more chaos. He didn’t. Trump went on to stay in power and lead the initial reponse to Covid-19. Hundreds of thousands of people died because of his incompetence and evil and in my opinion that blood is on the hands of all trumps enablers and those who were too much of a coward to stop it.
Please be honest here, are you part of a Chinese propaganda machine? Or are you saying Taiwan specifically should shrink its borders because these islands aren't mainland? And what are your thoughts on all the other countries that claim territory far from the mainland?
Well it's interesting timing with the recent objects being shot down over NA. Maybe China is showing a card and the US decided Taiwan isn't worth WWIII?

While I do appreciate you offering some info, I ask about Chinese propaganda because it's clear you have a strong viewpoint on this matter and, judging your grammar, English is not your main language. I won't hold it against you, I just like to understand motives when I'm presented with an argument.

It is up to indigenous populations to determine whether they conform or rebel. To single Taiwan out in a world dominated by multinational imperialism is just strange to me.

The term Taiwan is a geographical and not a political. It only includes the main island. Although in media the whole whole territory controlled by the ROC government is referred to as Taiwan doesn't mean it's correct. It's like calling UK England or calling Scottish people English. What media calls Taiwan includes two provinces: Taiwan and Fujian, which includes Taiwan. The Kinmenese don't identify themselves as Fujianese and not Taiwanese. It won't change who rules over them or where their government sits. You don't call every American Washinonian do you?

The Greeks settled their lands and displaced their people way back thousands of years, and the Macedonians with the Greeks destroyed the empire that ruled them in a stable and fair manner, just to lead to massive civil war that uprooted the region for decades.
But then people start talking about the past and our independence war (1919-1923) becomes “the Greek Genocide” when in reality Greeks came, tried to ethnically cleanse western anatolia from Turks, got wrecked and cried “genocider”. Until the Greek invasion there were no racial tensions to the point of ethnic cleansing.

In general, all throughout the Ottoman lands, Turks were literally killed, raped, and coerced into migrating to Anatolia when the empire started to fall. Millions of refugees came because Serbians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Armenians… all wanted their lands ethnically cleansed from Turks. Who knows how many didnt make it to Turkey. No one talks about it. But the ethnic cleansing of Greeks from Anatolia, which shamefully did happen but triggered by the Greek invasion, is oh so much more important.

Well thats wrong, the Greeks invaded to enforce the treaty after WW1 that granted eastern Anatolia to Greece. The Turks beat them and the British and French didn't help because they lost their own battles with the Turks. The Greeks then evacuated (depopulated) ethnic Greeks from Eastern Anatolia. Before that ethnic Greeks suffered greatly under the Ottomans. Neither side is completely guilty or innocent, but to claim that the Greeks were just slaughtering Turks left and right is just wrong.
Except they actually came out on top; having taken many boatloads of riches back to France, they didn't even mind that some of those boats wandered off and disappeared...
I've heard similar talk; the vast majority of Russian citizens have failed to condemn their own government's actions. It's their duty to be informed and exercise democracy. Their complacency and lack of vigilance has allowed this war to happen. The Russian people will be disdained for generations.

Russia will be hated by the rest of the world forever, the living circumstances will get worse than in North Korea.

I saw a lot of videos in the past 10 months from Russian teens crying over everything they can't have anymore. They grew up with western stuff, they are used to it. There a millions of them and they are missing all those things already. They will keep missing it. Just imagine your average teen being without Jeans and a phone and make up and nails. There is no way to smuggle so much stuff into the country and not in the quality they are used to. It won't take long until they need parts for their cars for dishwashers, laundry machines and dryers. They will need clothes for the kids that are growing, shoes, parts for machines. Russia isn't producing, they are only supplying materials. A couple of years ago they didn't even know how to make cheese!

They grew up with that stuff, they are used to it. They want their luxurious life they had before the war back.
Fwiw, I feel like there needs to be at least a ten year’s cooling off period between these sorts of things. Otherwise it feels a lot like “keep putting it up for vote until we get the result we want” which is a pretty scummy way to get things passed.
How are they going to get forced to hold a vote if they don’t want to. And why would they ever want to if polling wasn’t showing the vote was safe.

No reason why more voting is a bad thing in a democracy, might have prevented a lot of issues. See:current UK government popularity.

Edit: I think 2 different votes involved farming, maybe 3 different votes were about VAT. Probably unfair to claim that they are entirely different.

There have been referendums that affected Switzerland’s EU agreements, with significant repercussions. A vote on immigration that runs contrary to EU agreements for example has the potential to tear up decades of EU-Swiss agreements and to significantly affect their economy.

In 2022, yes. But there is nothing preventing the same issue from being voted on 4 times in a single year, and there is precedent for the same issue to be tweaked and voted on repeatedly across subsequent years. The Swiss-EU relationship has often been the topic of multiple referenda in a single year for example, and there certainly isn’t some arbitrary decade long time between votes.

This is all I'm concerned about. Biden's situation I'm sure will work itself out, but Trump has most certainly committed crimes well beyond and before simply having classified documents. I'm not even saying Biden hasn't broken the law, and he should be dealt with accordingly, but Trump has been a national security hazard and criminal since long before classified documents were found and obstruction was clearly committed to shield them, and this Biden situation should, in no way, get in the way of that case, which seems long overdue.

I 100% agree that there ought to be a reasonable investigation into this but I do have to wonder if any of this matters at all given that Biden is currently the president and therefore has not only the right to have classified information but also the ability to declassify that information.

Because it will 100% be used along with whataboutism to suggest that Biden was going after Trump for the same thing that he was caught doing, regardless of the fact that Biden was not responsible for the investigation into Trump's documents has not been outspoken about the retention of documents, subsequent Lies by his lawyers, and obstruction.

The subsequent "opinion" hosts on Fox instead focused on Biden being uniquely "irresponsible" (and, of course, downplaying the fact that Biden is cooperating with all legal inquiries), but they couldn't lean on their lies about institutional corruption at the White House. Perhaps I am naive, but I think that's a good thing.
Wish the players would join together, have a meeting and tell FIFA and Qatar that "unless you reverse the alcohol decision we will just play kick to kick for 45 minutes then another 45 minutes.
And of course there's also a question of whether it was ethical to ask Qatar to suspend their laws for the sake of football games, and whether it was realistic to believe them when they said they were fine with that... It's just a really fucking stupid situation with a really predictable outcome, and FIFA doesn't give a damn about the fans because they got their money.

Can we admit that young people are arriving increasingly late to an already rigged and corrupt game of Monopoly, meaning this great nation eats its young and those at the bottom of the "food chain" for the profits of an extremely and increasingly abusive ruling class?
Can we admit that the corruption in our institutions and our economic and political systems create abusive and unlivable conditions for so many people, which get diagnosed and written off as individual "mental health" problems?

As we are collectively driving our young to suicide in disturbing numbers, maybe that should be a cause for reflection, maybe a sign that some things have gone fundamentally wrong and should be examined.

There are too many people with a vested interest in the problem - creating the problem, ignoring the problem, misdiagnosing the problem, "treating" the problem. It's like we're all engaged in a collective gaslighting about our actual problems and shared reality.

That's not quite what I meant. While easy access to guns increases mass shootings, it also increases suicide rates. Not only are suicide attempts more likely to result in death, there are also more attempts made as gun access gets easier.
They may have been testing this idea a few years back by having people move from one state to another and then running for office right away. If someone from another state can violate the election laws, then why can't a foreigner come in and do it too?
Is that 3 contributors or just one. I mean, a migrant smuggler who is the cousin of a sanctioned Russian oligarch and a contributor to Trump could easily be ONE person.

So. What he has really done is a favor. He has grossly exposed his party and used their nearsighted abolishment of political safeguards to his advantage and bested them at their own game. He's not the biggest rat in the room, he's the smartest. He was elected, got all the way to DC on a background carpet of lies, took his seat and will receive all the perks, pay and privileges of his position.

Tesla is the only major car brand that skips dealers and does direct to consumer sales. Honestly, I’m not sure why more companies don’t do this because it’s good for everyone except the dealerships.
It’s just people with more money raising the prices for people with less money and dealers keep the difference of price for every sale.

If the MSRP is $20,000 and you are willing to pay $23,000, but then people with more money are willing to pay $30,000… they will sell it to the people who want to pay more. Then you have to buy an $18,000 car for $21,000.

In automobiles you have to spend money before you make money. As you move into EVs you have to spend. And you get it back as you sell cars. It happened to Tesla. Suggesting it's a bigger impediment for VW is bizarre. As they sell more cars the costs will amortize and retrospective views won't even show they lost as much on those cars as current figures do.

I think the issue is that there isn't any reason car companies couldn't take on this same fluctuating price practice. So your example does really apply to the reason for (or against) dealerships.
Everyone in this thread is focused on Finland, but the order also increases the military to 1.5M active duty. They currently have 1M, so this is increasing their active duty by 50%. There's little reason to think Russia can afford to do this or that the troops will be adequately trained/supplied. I think this is much less likely than a few bases on the Finish border.
Russia currently has a population of 147M. That means they plan on having 1 out of every hundred citizens being active military. If they're mostly men, that's one out of 50. Subtract the men under 16 and over 60, and you're probably talking one out of every 25.

My rough estimate is the numbers required for his goal would be 5% of appropriately aged males. So sure he does, if he goes to a total war footing and the people don’t have an impromptu defenestration.

Yeah, but doing so and performing this badly and then trying it on a nato applicant about to get the approval and who already has security assurances would be epically stupid.
I think part of it is that rent is a lot cheaper. Back in my home town I was paying £499/month for a 1 bed apartment. Now im in a big city and am paying £650/month.
There was a post on /r/ukpolitics about how most people would need a £49k salary to be comfortable... the average salary in the UK is £30k.

If we take £50k to make calculations easier, once you deduct taxes, pension and student loans, that leaves you with like £2800/month net income. So yeah, you can have a pretty comfortable life on that if your rent + utility bills are less than £1000/month.

Food, gas, utilities and rent is where all of our money goes and we mostly live paycheck to paycheck. We are both looking at our future more and more as time goes on. Save small amounts at a time and you will see your savings grow.

Don’t think you have to save up a lot every time you do save. Just save $5-$10 if you can. Start small watch it grow. Don’t feel like you have to be rich at a young age.

Take it in strides and don’t feel like you need to be rich right away. That only works if you grew up wealthy which I did not.
Like everything else, they don't actually cancel anything except love and compassion - you know, the things they supposedly stand for.

I think she said her problem with it is that the NFL is too "woke" and that singing the black national anthem was somehow "divisive" for the nation. Apparently sticking to the white peoples national anthem and forcing it down black American's throats is the classical American way to handle things and keep everyone together.

Complains that the black national anthem is being played, yet doesn’t know all of the words to the official national anthem. Doesn’t understand, or refuses to, empathize why black people would not resonate with the official national anthem.

Unsurprisingly, she has no problem with all of the black and white American flags with the single blue stripe. Silent on this, although there is “only one US flag”.
What did you say about the missile? I’ll have you know the missile has over 300 corrective commands and is the top of moving itself to a position where it isn’t.
The fact that they don't tells me that they are either unable to or too slow to find the aforementioned targets in a timeframe that allows them to be targeted with a cruise missile.

CRAMs like the Phalanx have a success rate of only around 50% against cruise missiles and other relatively slow missiles. They are incapable of intercepting ballistic missiles or hypersonic ones. Israel’s Iron Dome would have trouble intercepting all of Russia’s barrage of missiles against Ukraine as it was designed to defend against Hamas rockets, not actual cruise missiles.

China has enough ballistic missiles to destroy the majority of Taiwan’s air defences, radar stations and open military installations many times over. They don’t need to land troops within the first month of an invasion. All they need to do is cut the island off from any resupply and that’ll be pitifully easy. The US won’t want to get so close in range to China’s overwhelmingly large anti-ship missile stockpile and without a military escort, there will be no resupply of Taiwan.

Or China could just send a massive wave of missiles against all of Taiwan’s airports, sea ports and transport links to completely cut off the country’s food and weapons supply and starve the country into submission without needing to land a single troop onto the island.

I exclude the iron dome because it uses interceptor missiles to protect wide areas, which is not something Taiwan needs... China simply cannot destroy Taiwan to claim a victory. They need those chip fabs, they need those people, and they cannot afford the geopolitical cost of such a public slaughter of the people of Taiwan.

They don’t need to flatten the island, they just need to destroy any means through which Taiwan can get international assistance. That includes airports, sea ports and major transport links. They can leave residential areas and most of the cities intact. China most definitely has the capabilities for a mass precision missile strike.

Taiwan does not have the capabilities to completely defend their critical infrastructure from Chinese missiles. This is fact. Missile defence systems meant for ballistic missiles are not 100% effective and it’s much easier being the aggressor than defender here. China has too many missiles and Taiwan has too few defences to cover all their critical infrastructure.

So it’s safe to say CRAM systems in Taiwan would have a lot of trouble defending vital infrastructure like ports and airports against a barrage of missiles. CRAMs are also extremely close range and have a very small window of opportunity to destroy the missile before it hits its target.
Now, I'm not an Ukrainian so take this with gigantic pinch of salt. Since Minsk1 and Minsk2 were so successful in stopping Russia from seizing additional Ukrainian territory and invading Ukraine after Minsk1 and Minsk2, for Minsk3 to take place, Russia would have to pull back their troops into internationally recognized Russian territory FIRST. You can't punch someone in the face, break the nose, take the wallet then turn around say "Ok everyone let's just calm down. I will take the cash. You can have the wallet. How about we just go our own separate ways now?".
Yes. NATO was in talks with Ukraine past 2014, in reality they started in 2002 under bush. The point of the article is to try to make people understand that pushing for peace should be a valid option, and that, yes, while Russia has escalated this conflict greatly, both sides pressing hard and not backing down is a bad thing and could easily escalate out of control.

A Minsk 3 agreement would mean that Russia does not annex, but Russian troops withdraw on the promise of a continued autonomous zone, functioning as a kind of dmz for them.

You know Russia has no intention of honoring any kind of ceasefire. If Ukraine agrees to a ceasefire, it will last all of a day at maximum. Russia has shown time and time again throughout this conflict they will not honor the agreed upon standards of war, and they will not honor ceasefires. No one believes them anymore. They have made their intentions clear. They will not leave Ukraine willingly. They will finish their genocide of Ukraine if given the opportunity.
The worst part is that turnout in urban areas (the largest being Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati) decreased from 2018.

If we can overwhelmingly pass a constitutional amendment to ban partisan gerrymandering and then they do it anyway and the courts don’t stop them, do we even have a democracy anymore in Ohio?

The plan in Ohio is even more nefarious, though, because people _will_ still get to vote, it just needs to garner 60% or more of the vote if it's to add a constitutional amendment. So folks will still be able to get these initiatives on a ballot, but given Ohio has swung pretty far right this means more progressive items likely stand little chance of passing. Literally 40.1% of anyone who shows up to vote for a given issue can tank the will of a pretty damn big majority of Ohioans.

It didn't go quite that well. Sweden announced they'd send like $700K in aid (which isn't a lot of money for the size of this damage) and now they're asking for Turikye to open up their border with Syria to allow for refugees to receive aid in Turikye.
Not really the same thing. Turikye has been at war with Syria for a few years now actively carrying out missions in Syria to stop anti-Turikye insurgent groups that are attempting to take over regional power. They've closed their borders and made it insanely difficult for Syrians to immigrate or claim refugee status over security concerns.

You can ignore that because it doesn't have anything to do with the modern tensions between the state of Turikye and Armenia. The current tensions are based on the fact that there's a Cold War collapse state next to Turikye... and Turikye aligned with NATO whereas Armenia continues to align with Russia.

When Ukraine's enemy is a country that now you got 12 wars against them and the 11th one is called the Tenth Russo-Turkish War I feel Turkey would do a lot to stick it to Russia.

I think if there was no war in Ukraine Russia would have still helped out with the earthquake in Turkey cuz these are two unrelated events. And these two countries have a close relationship plus they aren't that far from eachother, so it would make sense for them to help eachother. I don't understand why this is being politicised here?
Which it is doing. Its not about the weapons it is buying and r and d for their own manufacturing which it is getting. They are getting half priced energy which they can dump along with the savings into their already exponential modernization and growth of infrastructure which is badly needed.
So yeah I get it. If we want India on the west's side... maybe make it worth their while or we can deal with them gouging and leveraging the fuck out of Russia.

If Redditors want to know why, it’s simple. Self interest. Much of their airforce consists of Migs. Many of their naval ships originated in the old USSR and are maintained using Russian tech, and their army uses Kalashnikov rifles and Russian armaments. Are they gonna condemn Russia for their little, er, ‘Special Military Operation’? Nooooo sir.

True. But it’s also gone if the US loses its patience. It’s gone if Germany ramps up Leopard 2 production. It’s gone if Putin’s ingrowing toenail turns out to be fatal. It has an economy the size of New York State. If it didn’t have nukes it would be the remnant of a joke. It is the second regime most urgently needing to be offed. After North Korea.
Republicans cannot quit Trump because they don't want to. Republicans cannot quit Trump because every American that cares for their country is forever equating Republicans to Trump. Republicans can't quit Trump because he gave them a roadmap to overthrowing our democracy and they all got away with their pathetic attempt. Trump is Republicans and Republicans are Trump.
The GOP wants a Trump, but some just don't want the Trump. But that's not how it's going to work. You don't get to keep the cult without the cult leader.

And while money certainly helps with those, I don't see Trump playing nice if the GOP fails to protect him.

Because Trump is blackmailing key GOP members and it isn’t hard to figure out whom. Trump is the person that every single person on earth would believe is capable of blackmailing someone but it’s too “impolite” for the media to ever investigate this. Trump is a “Carrot or stick” monster. You can take the carrot and keep your job and agency (to be used to serve him) or the stick, he will release his little manilla envelope of kompromat the Russians gave him on you (Hi, Lindsey!).
"The democratic president hasn't managed to deal with the massive deficit he inherited from us fast enough! So now elect us again, so we can blow it up so large, that the next democratic president will fail to fix it entirely as well.".
Yep. Right wingers in Poland keep complaining that these deals were influenced by the USSR, and that they didn't get enough money out of it.

It's also seems worth noting that this was brokered by the USSR, which saw both Poland and East German as Soviet vassal states at the time. But the frontier line was definitely made permanent by resettlement patterns and the breakup of the USSR...

It seems worth noting that, after the war, Poland received significant German territories, well over and above that taken by Germany in 1939.

I mean, in Germany’s defense, the modern Polish borders include huge areas of territory that were part of Germany until the end of World War II. Silesia, East Pomerania and Prussia were effectively destroyed on the basis that Prussian militarism had caused WWI and WWII.

It isn’t often discussed in textbooks, but iirc something like 2 million Germany civilians died when they were forcibly exiled by the Soviet army.

The reality is unfair, and the reality is that millions have no choice but to scrape by for minimal wages as drivers or deliverypeople to survive, and this will happen whether or not foreigners tip.

So I talk to a lot of drivers, the vast majority of them claim you can earn about 1800 dollars a month (again, on my specific city, can’t say that this is the reality of the rest of the state, much less the entirety of Brazil). That 1800 can be broken down to about 1000 to 1200 dollars being the cost of car maintenance and such, and between 800 to 600 dollars to the driver, they work something like 10 hours a day, Monday to Saturday.

Here’s my 2 cents on this, I live in the south of Brazil, sold my car long time ago and use Uber exclusively for transport (with all the taxes, insurance, gas costs, Uber is actually cheaper than having a car for work commute).
Well, I don't know much about accreditation to be fair, but federal grants come from a lot more places than just DOEd, and many of those sponsors have already included language requiring certain diversity and equity activities and expect there to be offices at IHEs that would address diversity concerns across campus. If those offices are shuttered, grants from NSF and other agencies may be in jeopardy for Florida IHEs.
They probably will if these types of things actually pass and start being enforced. Their universities can say goodbye to most federal grants as well if these laws are actually implemented.

Desantis attempting a speedrun of an authoritarian takeover/coup. He's pulling tactics from the last century's authoritarian hits.
Isn't that how it is done? If I understand correctly, (and I very well may not, but would be happy to learn more if someone would like to correct me).
Keep on repeating until you get the purity you need. So it makes sense they would enrich, enriched uranium. i.e. they are just working towards a higher level of purity, but each step I suppose it technically enriched.

The remainder U-238 from the process is often called "depleted uranium" since it far less U-235, and as a result, is a lot less radioactive.

The depleted U238 (remember if you started out with 1 ton of uranium, you'd end up with just 7.5 kg of pure u235., so getti g considerable amounts of u235 requires tons and tons of U238. The U238 can be used for different things. You can convert it to Pu239 in breeder reactors, or as depleted uranium it can be used at tank armor and tank rounds ( though even the US is endnming DU tank rounds out of preference for ithe rmaterials and for environmental reasons. It could be used as nuclear shielding and be quite good in certain applications , as it's denser than lead, but people don't like to use it as such.
>The resolution first passed the Senate in March, along party lines. When it came up again last month, it passed 61-37, with support from 12 Democrats.
It went through the senate with 61 votes. So just enough to kill a filibuster. But next session fetterman takes away an R seat, and so if even 1 person changed their mind it won't even be filibuster proof let alone veto proof.

I’m confused in order to veto something doesn’t it have to pass both the house and the senate both of which are currently controlled by the democrats?

I added in an edit just now to explain because I guess I wasn't clear, but I wasn't saying that it would be overridden, just referencing the time the GOP did exactly that to Obama.
I like it when people who know stuff explain their stuff to conspiracy theorists. It won't make the conspiracy theorist understand they got fooled, but I enjoy the informative little reads, and it turns a potentially awful comment chain into a suddenly nice read. Thank you.
Thank you very much. If that's really MoD official account they are laughing stock now. No one stores live warheads on the missile airframes. As I said before - they are coming in a form of kits. Mission is confirmed, airframe is prepared, warhead is programmed and installed, bomber is configured for the mission, bomber is generated. That's how it works in UK, US and Russia.

They launched a training version of Kh-55 as a decoy. That's it. Nothing more. Maybe it was at the end of shelf life or something.

There are already articles "interpreting" what MoD had in mind that they just installed the concrete simulator instead of live warhead.

AFAIK nuclear cruise missiles like that are usually stored without the live warhead, and there's a dummy installed for training etc. Only ICBMs and other missiles intended for immediate response to a nuclear attack are constantly armed.
I get it, I do, but it is kind of annoying seeing everything King Charles does and has done be ridiculed despite him pushing for more positive environmental change and acting on more change than any government we’ve ever had.
I think King Charles is doing an okay job for an essentially powerless titular head - and he has long been pro-environment and done a lot to advance environmental causes from what I understand, but its not enough to outweigh the hatred people have over the death of Diana - which he had nothing to do with after all. I don't get it either.

Now, resenting being rich and representing an outdated institution, I get that, but even that is shaded by Diana. If one of his sons becomes King, I bet the Media reverses direction 180 degrees and makes Royalty cool again because a young monarch will sell more advertising with the public.

The Media built very heavily on the narrative of Diana the young princess - and as it turns out she was a fantastic woman. Then she and Charles had trouble due to it being an arranged marriage - and the Media built up her side of that story and made bank on the results. When she died due to being pursued by those same Media people - they turned up the blame on Charles. Public opinion has never been on Charles' side and now that he is King, the media continues to ride the unpopularity they generated and the public is swept along with it.
Keep in mind, the bill didn't pass by a vote of 62-37, it only advances to be voted on at this point by that margin.
Obviously it now only needs 50 senators to approve it to pass, but it'll be interesting to see if anyone who voted for a vote on it will now vote against it (or vice-versa).

Overcoming the filibuster to start debate on the bill is what requires 60 votes, which is the vote that this article is talking about. The subsequent vote after debate is closed that decides whether the bill passes or not only requires a simple majority of 50+1.

If you pass something through budget reconciliation, that only takes a simple majority, but that only refers to spending.

However one of the Senate's rules is that a few spending bills ("budget reconciliation") cannot be filibustered. They can only do this a few times per year, and these bills can only have certain types of provisions. For example, it's not possible to do a marriage bill under budget reconciliation because it has nothing to do with taxing/spending.

1. Someone tried to filibuster to prevent the bill from being voted on. No surprise there, nearly every bill gets filibustered.

However, not all Democrats want to get rid of the filibuster. Most famously Manchin and Sinema are against getting rid of it, but the truth is there are even more Dems who also want to keep it in place. It's not going away anytime soon.
Erdogan is trying to extort from both NATO and Russia. He apparently thinks that his Security is up to the task of protecting him from Putin's inevitable ire when Sweden and Finland get in.
And YOU realize that Putin regards Finland's membership into NATO as a threat--when he hasn't threatened Finland, right??

Ridiculous, and patently unrealistic. Riddle me this: if Putin's army is on the ropes from what was supposed to be a "quick" Ukraine invasion: then how's he supposed to invade several other countries, simultaneously?? And even assuming Putin thought he could bully the world through nuclear blackmail: what's to stop NATO, et al, from covertly supplying these invaded nations--just as they're doing with Ukraine?

Had Ukraine been allowed to join NATO there wouldn't have been a war in Ukraine to begin with, just like Sweden and Finland won't have to worry about Russian aggression from now on.

In either case, the assumption you are making is that because Russia is finding out their military is not up to even Soviet standards that somehow that means they aren't a threat to any of their neighbors. Leaving aside they are still a nuclear power, it wouldn't take much to actual revamp their military, learn from their past mistakes and use all their oil money to become the military power that they mistakenly thought they were in the first place. And then there is the fact that they went in alone, but that won't necessarily always be true. What do you think say a Russian-Chinese alliance could pull off for example? Believing that a country is safe from a warmongering autocratic neighbor without having allies to protect your back is the height of stupidity.
Would you accept the results if the Supreme Court intervenes and allows elections to be decided by gerrymandered state legislatures that don’t represent a majority of voters?
Again, I don't care if they SAY they don't want democracy gone if they then go and vote for the party that has been trying to enact a coup and restrict voting rights and remove legitimate mail-in ballots and passing state-level laws to override the popular vote for presidential electors.

Lots of things. The biggest is probably a network of allied media outlets that mirror what Republicans have with Fox / Breitbart / Sinclair Media / Every single talk radio station in the country. The GOP doesn't directly fund this of course but they are supported by an activist base, and the Democrat activist base is currently too individualistic and needs to unite around creating broadcast institutions of all sizes.

Yes, but they aren't doing that. If you vote for a less extreme candidate in the primary but cast a vote for the extreme one anyways in the general, you're contributing to steering it towards extremism.

You want moderate Republicans voting to help steer it away from extremism. You want the Democrats to be more palatable to moderates. If those two things could be accomplished the country would be better off for it.
I don’t think this excuse really works, as they didn’t treat people in Poland much better during the “liberation”. They raped, murdered and robbed just the same, even though Polish people were victims of Nazis as well.
They all tortured, murdered and (gang-)raped, no matter the nationality. One side just was more successful pushing their narrative.

The big hit if either voting company wins is to force Fox to change or risk more and more similar litigation. Theirs are extreme cases, but if either (or both) win, targets of Fox are going to start using those judgements to attack Fox.

I’m reading this as though the people who would be impacted are within Fox or associated with Fox. It would have been irresponsible to expose them like that, to what I’m not exactly sure. Prosecution for aiding and abetting a treasonous president in his attempted coup? They were protecting themselves, not the country.
ok, and, as the article mentions, the vast majority of independents vote for one party overwhelmingly.
Absolutely, ranked choice voting would give the independents a lot of power and pull politics back to the center instead of a choice between two extremes.

You mean the one that allows the federal government to keep operating, but also allows Republican governors to kick people off Medicaid in their shitty moron-filled states?
The reason this "problem" exists in the first place is because the federal government prevented states from removing people from Medicaid who don't qualify for it. If they don't qualify for Medicaid now because they have coverage from their employer or the ACA, then why should they still be on Medicaid?

Is wrong because we are talking about healthcare COVERAGE not hospitals and the polling you provided shows that a majority want the system we have, which is a mix of government programs like Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance.

Most didn't, and you can tell because they're going off on rants about universal healthcare when the issue being addressed in the article is these people no longer qualify for Medicaid.

There's a reason people like me, union members, and others are against universal healthcare because it reduces the quality of care we currently receive. It also means dealing with the issues countries like Canada and Europe deal with in their universal systems that I and others don't have to.
Banned stuff has to be transported. Transport vessels are very expensive. Insurance companies will refuse to insure said ship if they're carrying banned goods. Transit areas like straits (e.g., Bosphorus) will refuse access to ships which aren't insured because ships can damage the strait or get stuck and require millions to extract (e.g., Evergreen in the Suez Canal).
So if a ship is carrying Russian oil to a country that's paying more than $60/bbl for it, then that ship is effectively uninsured and can only travel in the open ocean directly to/from Russia. That basically limits Russian exports to the Pacific Ocean where it, presumably, doesn't have a ton of oil infrastructure.

That basically limits Russian exports to the Pacific Ocean where it, presumably, doesn't have a ton of oil infrastructure.
In summary, if a ship transports Russian oil at a price over 60$, it won't get insurance to cross the Straits like Suez Canal. Then this ship will only able to take the Open Waters meaning it delay it's transport tremendously (going around Africa to go to India). Since part of the money is only transferred once the goods are delivered, the remaining 50-70% of the sum will come late while Russia needs as much money as possible right now.

Countries are not friends, they don't help each others out without gaining something in return. If you take India, they have no incentive to pay Russia an extra 20$ because they know Russia HAS TO sell its Gaz. And if Russia doesn't want to sell for 60$ and the ship has to take the route around Africa to reach India, the delivery will take a lot more time which means Russia will gets the money later (probably 50% at delivery) and they can't afford that.

And if Russia doesn't want to sell for 60$ and the ship has to take the route around Africa to reach India, the delivery will take a lot more time which means Russia will gets the money later (probably 50% at delivery) and they can't afford that.
So what is in place from countries being like, "we will pay $60 per barrel" so that they stay insured and can transport it or whatever, and then, they turn around and pay Russia and extra $20 after the oil has already been shipped and delivered?

They absolutely will bother to do it. Look at Wall Streets history of corruption and fraud, and the governments history of corruption and fraud in regards to "war/defense" in the US and the energy markets.

Just because the general population might "think" countries are only paying Russia $60, doesn't actually mean they aren't paying $80. The elite are corrupt as fuck.
If your entire sovereignty movement just blatantly ignores the basic structures of government as set out in the constitution, which is also the basis of your governments authority, you're gonna have a bad time.
The law’s not really about the sovereignty movement like the headline implies, it’s about trying to limit the power the federal government has when it acts (in their view) without proper authority. Right now how it works is the feds write laws that then have to be enforced in the provinces, if they think the law violates the provinces jurisdiction they have to go to court and prove it. This new law tries to put the onus on the feds to prove their law does not violate provincial jurisdiction before it is enforced.

When they actually make a law that violates the division of powers, it'll get challenged quick enough. Probably not by the federal government, but by a civil group that got screwed over by it.

Yes, our provincial government are a bunch of amoral idiots. They think that declaring “sovereignty” with no takesie-backsies is a nuanced political tactic. They think that we can separate from Canada, somehow keep the Crown Land and Treaty Lands, and that the UN Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States will somehow force other provinces to let us build pipelines across their land. They’ve forbidden mask mandates in schools and have created a ministry specifically to protect anti-vaxxers from “discrimination” at a time when we have record numbers of children sick and in hospital. There are too many other things to go into here, but basically they’re the worst fucking government in the history of the province - and that’s a low bar to hit.

Please know that the majority of Albertans don’t want any of this. It’s embarrassing that this government has the support they do, according to polls, but it’s not out of line with the level of support Republicans have in the USA, for example. So, in that respect it’s not unusual. But still embarrassing.

It was supposed to “allow Alberta to ignore federal laws or regulations that the provincial government deemed harmful to the province”, but everyone with half a brain knew that was complete bullshit that would never fly. The Lieutenant Governor hinted that she would not give Royal Assent to any bill that was blatantly unconstitutional, and this was. As a result, clauses about “ignoring” federal legislation were diluted to the point where any possible interpretation is already covered by existing legislation.
And yet, millions of Ukrainians remain displaced, their homes destroyed, and most of their financial lives ruined.
The original post is absolutely true. Putin was a joke until he wasn’t. Sure we here in the US can laugh and call him a joke. I bet millions of Ukrainians don’t share that same sentiment.

You’re missing the point. N Korea could still level S Korea if they wanted to. Sure, that’s about all they could do before we wiped them from the face of the earth. Nevertheless, they could still kill tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of S Koreans if they choose to.

It's more likely we'd completely genocide North Korea with conventional weapons before they actually took out Seoul. Their nuclear weapons are essentially firecrackers, and they don't have enough of them to get through the ballistic missile defenses in place. Not to mention the short range factor.

The real problem with North Korea is mopping up after their failed offensive. You'd need to build a giant wall to keep the Northerners from fleeing into South Korea, and many of them would be fleeing to start a street-level insurgency. You're not talking about "trillions of dollars of massive infrastructure damage," but hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of civilian casualties are not off the table.

The problem is you now have millions of impoverished civilians with no education who hate your guts and have been trained to believe you're the devil to deal with. And if you thought Iraq or Afghanistan was a quagmire... we'd be ten trillion dollars deep into attempting to rebuild North Korea and they'd still be fighting an insurgency (probably funded by China for funsies, no less).

Not even South Korea's interested in that mess anymore. Everyone's pretty happy with the tinpot dictator status quo, for better or worse.
>“Let me tell you something,” Wilson said. “Donald Trump would rather Joe Biden be president for a thousand years than Ron DeSantis be president for five minutes.”.
DeSantis doesn't have Trump's charm, he doesn't have Trump's money, and it remains to be seen whether he has Trump's sociopathic viciousness. Popularity isn't enough. Governing isn't enough. Ideas and policies aren't enough. These guys are in a pissing contest. MAGA voters care about dominance. Who is the Alpha MAGA? We've seen Trump neuter opponents before. Does DeSantis have it in him to take down Trump?

Good point. If the right wing media start to criticise Trump for his lies and divisiveness and self obsession, rather than justify or even lionise, the dynamic would definitely be different.

Part of Trump's power has been the media's tendency to frame everything in terms of "why are Republicans angry today?" When he's the only game in town , even left leaning media is obsessed with him to the exclusion of everything else. But that dynamic isn't a Trump thing, it's a Newt Gingrich thing. Right wing media power is drifting away from Trump, and mainstream to left leaning media has already signaled a shift to DeSantis as soon as he comes out of the Fox News bubble.
Just a hypothetical here, let's say Ghana needs to buy one barrel of oil (currently around $80). They need to convert their own currency to USD first in order to buy that barrel. Currently, it takes 14.41 Ghanian Cedi (their currency) in order to get 1 USD. Maybe that doesn't sound like a lot, but at the beginning of the year it was around 6 Cedi = 1 USD. A HUGE difference. A single USD is now 135% more valuable compared to the Cedi than it was on January 1.

So, yeah. Maybe u should convince the world that weaponizing the dollar and printing paper currency based in faith is still the best option.

U guys who still have faith are always saying that this faith backed currency ia great and the best option. Yet the reserve currency in USD keeps falling meeting the natural and historic trend of empires rise and fall. Right now at 59%. Once u hit that 40%, it might happen till 2030, things wont be too well internally for the US.
This argument has been had, fascism is inherently intolerant and its dangerous motives are hidden behind bad faith arguments and lies.
I guess my main point would be that "Nazi" is such a historical trigger word that it lets the fascists derail the conversation. Much more accurate to just use the timeless term - fascists.

Yeah fascism is way more specific. The current GOP/Maga is not just authoritarian, they're that step further that brings it into fascism. Every single one of the 14 points of fascism from Umberto Eco's "Ur Fascismo" are checked off by their current platform.

If they tell you to define fascism, tell them to look in the mirror. They're going to disregard what you say to begin with and any opening that doesn't clearly define their fascism they will then use for their argument. Don't argue with these people, mock them, insult them, demean them, don't engage in an actual argument. It says their views are acceptable enough to argue.
And I Thank you. I too am a boomer, and I approve this message. I will vote for true democracy as well until I'm gone. And I wish a lot of people on these sub-reddits would stop grouping all boomers as conservatives.

Has Manchin been against loan relief at all? I thought most of his holdups were things that personally affect him- like anything to do with coal, or taxes that'd affect him or his businesses.

Nah, imo- it's just learning too late that bipartisanship wasn't going to work here... just as it hasn't worked in the 12 years prior. He came in going "lets work together", and got the Obama treatment, so the current strat is to actually maybe-sorta try and get things done.
The only ones they have thousands of are S300s, which have limited range (<120km) and are far older and less reliable.
So the expectation is that Russia will continue to use cruise missiles and Iranian drones for long range strikes, and they are very limited in their stocks of those while their hit rates are getting worse and worse.

Russia is firing more cruise missiles than it can produce but assuming they are going to run out is wrong. They have been trying to increase production and there are serial numbers found on missiles indicating they were produced this year.

Those articles were from 30 days into the war, when Russia supposedly ran out of half its missiles. We are 300 days into the war and Russia is still running out of missiles. At this pace by 3000 days into this war, we can safely assume that Russia will still be running out of missiles.

Russia uses more than 70 missiles per attack to ensure saturation of Ukrainean air defence. Depending on how many they throw at once that means 3,4 attacks.

Yes, thats why the news statement is that they have enough missiles for another 3,4 massive 100 missile attacks. They can choose not to fire the last 400 missiles at Ukraine and then they won't run out. Estimates can only be made based on consumption rates and guesstimated production rates and stockpiles. Their consumption rates have gone down a lot since March.
While Reagan (R) eliminated the fairness doctrine, it was it was Clinton (D), ironically, who signed the telecommunications act of 1996 which allowed the media to become such an effective weapon of the autocrats. The "free press" is supposed to be the thing that the framers believed would hold the government accountable. These days much of the country believes media companies are click-bait advertising platforms with fake news for views. Everything about the media industry needs a reformat.
So here we are, it is possible to use all three branches of the federal government to target and eliminate political opponents. The supporters of these autocrats are as bad. We see candidates or public officials openly encourage physical violence. Then supporters of these people physically assault opponents/their family, shoot at opponent homes, run political opponents off road, and/or turn out for insurrection and hangings. The media have been neutralized and rather than shine light on this corruption they salivate over every opportunity to print those juicy, click bait, headlines.

Tbh I think it’s the Chinese leadership just throwing a hissy fit because they didn’t get their way with ‘Zero Covid’ policies, primarily because they almost faced the first ever Chinese revolution, but also because they hate their own citizenry who they look down on like insects.
“You told us to stop our Zero Covid policy, so enjoy the over-packed hospitals, we’re not helping any more” -all Chinese politicians overlords.

Russia is quickly rediscovering reality again in the form of Ukrainian defiance, and China; from a pandemic that every other country on the planet has managed to get under control, except them.

I think what they actually implemented was a ‘close your eyes, cover your ears, and hope for the best’ policy. Yeah Russia and China just decided they want the world to hate them this year, apparently. So they’re both acting-out and lying to the point where they think they can just create their own reality.

I guess when the lie has a certain intent and purpose, it will keep being used for the same reasons and so we get the same lies again and again.
But there is a basic logical problem with this definition. Woman means "an adult who lives and identifies as female" but a female is "a woman or girl". So it's a circular definition.
From your point of view, I agree, those circular definitions probably don't seem like a big deal at all. You might know tranpeople in real life, and you treat them with the respect they deserve because you intuitively understand their stance on gender.

Trans women are women; the fact some people don't like that and may choose to believe otherwise is immaterial.

Trans women are just that… men who believe they are women. It doesn’t matter how long or often you say it, you can’t change reality. Transwomen ≠ women, they are quite literally men down to the cellular level.

Also, by the logic you're following, cis women aren't women either. They'd be cis women. At which point no one is a woman, since neither cis or trans women would qualify.

“Cis” is an invention to bring gender down to a “type.” So people like you can say the female gender comes in two varieties, cis and trans, but both have equal claim to womanhood. They don’t.
I've been following this war since I have an interest in military history and things (which makes it kinda morbid tbh) and because I hate Putin funding what amounts to neo fascism, so my credentials are of someone that os very vaguely aware of stuff rather than completely clueless, take me as a girl sharing gossip.
Ukraine has taken considerable efforts to do a military reform ever since Crimea (IIRC it was named something like "desovietization") showed the UA to be kinda bad, in that they took efforts to decrease and mitigate corruption, improve organization, modernize equipment....they even changed the uniforms AFAIK (and I don't mean camouflage, I'm taking about far more meaningless stuff like their berets).

Anyways, one of the things I saw mentioned about this on reddit is that the particular air defense rocket that hit Poland lacks a self destruction mechanism, I'm assuming that's common nowadays, and allows to remotely destroy a AD rocket if it misses something or goes rogue.

It's enough to destroy or fell another flying missile, and prob at \some distance too (I doubt these are basically guided gyro jets and just slam into the intercepted missile).

I doubt there is any ADA in existence that doesn’t have an automated self destruct mechanism to prevent the missile from coming back down.

Being careless is the entire point of a missile defense system, it's supposed to do everything in it's power to stop the missile. Sometimes it will destroy a cruise missile mid-air and the warhead will land in somebodies house and still kill people.
Russian civilians would always say flat out that they think america is misguided and that they think Putin did a good job controlling Trump and us politics. Under obama, they were always under threat of strikes or sanctions if they made any moves on ukraine and could not make a move.
Trump's primary use for russia (in russian minds at least), wasn't to make us politics a primary shitshow, it was a primary objective to cause enough chaos to prepare for a war to invade ukraine without the threats or sanctions Obama or Biden or even Bush or any past non compromised president would have made.

The U.S. has been increasing tensions with Russia and attempting to provoked into a military conflict and now this is the narrative to justify it.

If we back down in the face of Russian aggression, we signal that the US, and more broadly the UN, no longer has the will to enforce that basic idea that borders as drawn by the UN are immovable. This would likely start a feeding frenzy. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, China has been remarkably belligerent when it comes to Taiwan, going so far to threaten Nancy Pelosi on her visit there. If we back down from Russia, I can guarantee that China will take a shot at claiming Taiwan.
The rest of the democrats to a RURAL voter come off as "elitist" or "communist" unless I'm missing any.
Like if they put Adam Schiff in there he'd appeal to 0% of the rural voting group and when you look at a lot of the rural area democrats you're likely looking at a POC. Aside from: Tom O'Halleran, Peter Welch, and Ron Kind who are all kind of... unexciting or hell even well known. You've got like Bennie Thompson and Jim Clyburn who are both pretty damn old (I think they're pretty qualified outside of that - but yeah that's not going to happen). Hell all of these guys are pretty old.

We do need someone younger. Unfortunately, picking a speaker of the house that would actually appeal to the old, white, rural people of the United States wouldn't actually be a democrat, because generally speaking - they don't pick democrats... And it definitely isn't due to race/gender.

Fair enough - but personally embodying the diversity of the Democratic Party, in stark contrast to the lack of diversity in the Republican caucus, may very well be a valuable trait for “uniting the caucus”.
This fucker proposed that peace talks between Ukraine & Russia begin with Ukraine accepting that the territories Russia has annexed (but not conquered) belong to Russia and that they negotiate over the rest.
Any talk of Russia re-entering the international community can only take place after Ukraine is at peace, reparations have been (or are being) paid, and the war criminals prosecuted — all of them.

I dont think it is wrong to say that Russia should eventually rejoin the international community, but only after Ukraine's sovereignty is restored, war criminals are prosecuted, and reparations are made.

Untill Russia should be trusted and be part of international community again, there is a long way to go in the culture and mentality of that nation. They were helped not to lose to the nazis and wanted half of Europe for that and they were trusted again with Putin as a leader just to create this shitstorm that is going on right now.

From my point of view there were enough concessions made for them and besides the nuclear weapons(which I do not believe are an option for them at this point) there is nothing else that they have as a bargain chip. So I don’t see how this people think it is a solution for them to gain anything from the war in Ukraine. It is baffling!
Took them over 2 decades to copy a dc-9 and they still haven’t certified it in any other countries. That’s 1960’s technology. Douglas tried to help them in the 80’s, Sukhoi of Russia had to design and build the wings for them to put on it because they couldn’t build the wings, and they still can’t make a native turbofan engine and buy them from GE or Rolls Royce. So decades for an advanced stealth aircraft is probably pretty accurate.
"The last 10% is harder than the first 90%" is an extremely relevant saying regarding stealth planes. It is comparatively easy to make a shape with a lower radar cross section, hide engines within the fuselage, use s-bends to obscure rotor blades, and reduce airplane noise. The hard part developing and maintaining radar absorbing paint cost effectively, transitioning from a design that uses low radar cross section techniques to one that doesn't compromise the cross section for other features, and carefully machining the components with extremely precise tolerances.

The continued operation of an "outdated" bomber like the B-52 is precisely because the B-2 has such advanced stealth characteristics. The B-2, as a bomber, compromises different functions by maximizing stealth. The B-52 still has uses today when the B-2 is not needed, when it's ludicrous operating costs cannot be justified for a mission.

Time will tell if the Chinese airforce and industry can stomach the true costs of a stealth plane program, and whether or not these planes turn into parade peices, or a millitary backbone.

There's good reason why arms suppliers outside the USA aren't making lots of their own true stealth planes, it's really expensive, and the DOD is able to absorb the costs. And even the mighty USA Military isn't able to fully realize their potential.
Looks like the liberal readers here do not like it when one of their own media outlets posts some facts that do not lean their way. Truth is fair so if someone is outright fibbing to the public, it should be noted. Too bad Fox News would never do the same to one of their own, however, since they tend to exaggerate and even originate some odd claims.
In contrast here, for most of Trump's presidency I made an effort to give benefit of the doubt when I saw headlines saying he said something misleading, false, or otherwise just awful. I'd go in reading those articles looking for ways Trump was getting an uncharitable assessment. But, far more often than not, when I read or watched the things Trump actually said, the headlines were actually giving Trump more credit than he deserved. The crap that came out of Trump's mouth was regularly even worse than the headlines I tried to take with a grain of salt.

The crap that came out of Trump's mouth was regularly even worse than the headlines I tried to take with a grain of salt.
In that context, CNN's descent into a hard right turn under the guise of balance is even more wretched.
Its virtually impossible to not have lots of paramilitary groups who are straight up nazi or fascist in ideological definition in such a scenario.
Its a poor as dirt poorer then many african countries nowadays country in europe fighting a conflict since 2014. And had historical prevelance of fascists with bandera and etc.

Also some out-and-about nazis that are part of the government military or something? I'm not too well informed on the exact details there.

Wasn't there like a genuine issue with ukranian nazi militias promoting themselfes at the beginning of the war? They'd flock to journalists covering the situation in order to promote their groups and stuff.

Like, Putin is full of shit about everything he says about Ukraine BUT they do have a pretty notable nazism issue as far as I am aware.

If Ukraine news gets blurred in the background, so would people support and political sanctions on Russia.

That's why they are coming up with all the laws recently which before the war were very controversial in Ukraine.
Did you not notice the war in Europe? Russia already started war posturing and invasions in Europe, it's ENTIRELY prudent for countries to prepare for self-defense.
My point is ASEAN countries are going to militarize regardless, and are, because they are facing PLA imperialism in real life, as we speak, not as some hypothetical. It's not a matter of "should we piss China off or not", it's a fact China is already an imperial power trying to weaken their neighbours. Do we do nothing in response to this? Is the question. China is not being "forced" to steal territory actively from their neighbours. But we may be forced to respond.

The ones feeling "cornered" are the much smaller Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia etc that are seeing large swathes of their traditional (and internationally recognized) territorial waters being literally taken over violently by China who claims waters 1000s of KM from their own shores. Or India who has received multiple PRC incursions across previously stable Lines of Actual Control. Or Japan who regularly receives threats from China that it will take over some of their islands. Let alone Taiwan which is under direct pressure not withstanding a possible invasion in the future.

"My neighbours don't want me to be an imperial power" does not mean "cornered". Far too often I hear defenders of China say, "Philippines etc. do not deserve sovereignty because they are lapdogs of the US". Directly justifying Chinese imperialism while painting themselves as victims. I find it funny you argue China is cornered while ignoring China cornering their neighbours.

Thank God we can do pretending China isn't a threat. Probably the greatest thing "W" ever said was that "China is not a strategic ally. They are s strategic enemy.".

In the end, it is. We are the good guys, though we are not angels. We do not conquer. We might wage wars, but we do not annex land. We do not target civilians. We do not wage total war like Russia did. We do not murder journalists. Our leaders do not become the richest men in their country. We have the moral high ground, by comparison.

you say that, but it is. you have to buy it on the 'black market' meaning at least 3x the price. you can get it in KSA even. muslim friend in KSA that would drink. its not that uncommon.

a gasoline mixture works better and is easier to get ahold of, especially there. only disadvantage they have is probably bottle size. without alcohol i dont see many 1.5L bottles being available, but thats an assumption.

the oddest time was running in to a saudi expat and we had to poorly speak cantonese to communicate while drinking and smoking.
Also, he and his party made sure those of us in states that actually invest in our public sector hand over more federal dollars to states that refuse to do so, and encourage our states to behave more like theirs.
Even worse for them, they made the tax cuts for the less affluent look bigger than they really were, meaning that even a lot of people who still came ahead didn't feel like they had come out ahead.

No they'd be happy to pay that tax as it's regressive, it's even worse for low income people than a flat income tax that doesn't increase with income bracket, because lower income people tend to spend a greater fraction of their income on actual stuff. So it ends up being a 20-30% total tax on the poor, and less than 1% for the rich, rather than it being the opposite now.

Removing income and other taxes and replacing them with a sales tax moves ALMOST ALL TAXES from the rich to the Middle class and poor.

The national sales tax also would eliminate the income tax. Actually, it eliminates the IRS entirely. Without IRS agents, there are no audits of the rich. The IRS already does not have the capacity to track down the multiple ways the ultra rich hide their income, thereby avoiding taxes, and these SOBs want to make it even easier for the rich to hide their money.

Of course, in their zeal to make the ultra rich even richer on the backs of working class Americans, the GOP national sales tax eliminates the estate tax and the capital gains, gift and corporate taxes.

Just like the Trump tax cuts, it is a continuation of the republican money grab for the very wealthy.
The headline is very misleading. The actual statement from the authorities is that four(!) girls have received asylum due to their gender, not that any girl/woman coming to Denmark is promised anything.
Im Danish and you are right in that they are not promised anything. There will still be checks and controls - but at the moment the headline is correct. It will be eligible for all Afghan woman and girls.

Imagine owning a bar and let in white people without asking questions, but all black people will have to go through a process to get in. They have to answer some questions, do some tests et cetera. I think it is fairly obvious that is not a fair system.

Everyone going through the same process doesn't mean the result is the same. Let's say I own a business and I need some employees to do some data entry. I don't really care about your education, looks, gender or what not. All I want is that you are accurate at data entry. So everyone can apply, and everyone gets the same data entry assessment where you need to do some data entry. Some pass, some fail. I hire the ones that pass. Everyone had to go through the same process and meet the same requirements. But that didn't mean the end result was the same for all.
Almost certainly not true. Even if the engines had failed (which the video evidence does not strongly support), the pilot can maintain control and land, even if it's short of the airfield. This is a far better outcome than a stall/spin, which the video does strongly support. The aircraft is shown in an extreme nose-high attitude prior to spinning in, which is strongly indicative of a stall. Stall/spins are rarely survivable, whereas a controlled off-field landing often is, depending on terrain. Yes, I am a pilot.
I am a pilot, and a former instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School. I taught folks how to test airplanes to evaluate engine-out performance.

The short snippet of video I saw of the airplane before the crash looked like either the left wing was dropping precipitously or the pilots were banking hard to the left. If both props were feathered (hence, no thrust from the engines) and a tight turn was initiated, it would be very easy to stall the plane since that would likely not be a configuration the pilots had ever experienced before. And at low altitude, a non wings level stall could very easily cause the airplane to roll nearly inverted and hit the ground since there’s no altitude to recover.

While I'm not disagreeing that they had an engine problem, the plane seemed to have a higher angle of attack than you would typically expect for a pilot trying to glide in for a landing.

OTOH if you’re low, not used to engine-out approaches, and/or not familiar with the glide characteristics of the aircraft, you can easily tend towards a nose-up attitude, which can quickly lead to a stall/spin.
Obviously the purpose of this sabatoge was to cut off a potential energy route (not in use) from Russia to Europe. I guess I can suspect Russia, but who do you all think it was and why?
And there's no more fear and uncertainty in Europe than there was when Russia invaded. Everyone in Germany knows they need to ditch piped Russian gas and find alternative energy sources.
And there's no more fear and uncertainty in Europe than there was when Russia invaded. Everyone in Germany knows they need to ditch piped Russian gas and find alternative energy sources.
But once fighting in Ukraine had stopped (he thought he'd control Ukraine by March) he likely hoped that Germany would shrug its shoulders and get back to buying gas; that happened in 2014 after Russia seized Crimea. That couldn't happen this time if he ordered the pipeline blown and Putin hoped (tho he was a fool in this regard) that us relatively wealthy Europeans would once again buy his gas in future.

Russia, since they can't throw Europe out of a window they can cut off a significant portion of Europe's energy supply which they did after they secured other trade routes for that gas. It certainly beats having to keep throwing all those Gazprom executives out the window to avoid the feedback influence Europe was having in Russia.
And Republicans will ensure that cuts to the budget will deny as much aid to Ukraine as they can so their beloved conservative hero Putin can finally roll tanks theough Kyiv and execute Zelensky.
The issue is that the Republicans are using this as a cover for cutting aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian (which many of them, and Trump himself, are clearly either outright compromised by and/or minimally way too cozy with).

Cutting a bloated defense budget is not a bad thing in and of itself, especially if the money was to be allocated to social programs, infrastructure, education, etc., and especially if its NOT done in a way that sacrifices a people who are standing up against the autocrat Putin and his actions which has included genocidal behavior (such as the theft of children in an effort to destroy the Ukrainian identity).

At a time when Russia and China are building up their forces, Russia is invading Ukraine, and China is preparing to invade Taiwan and the South China Sea islands, it's a bad idea to cut the defense budget.

Yes, military spending is bloated, BUT the timing of a sudden isolationist austerity push at a time we are barely winning a decisive proxy war against Russia is 100% inappropriate and in line with Russian hybrid warfare. And the GOP would be happy to watch the world burn if they could pin a major defeat on the Democrats, as the GOP did when we 'lost' China.

Seeing a lot of folks demand 50% cuts. Ok. If we demand blindly set artificial caps on prices, expect some bad consequences.

Yes, we should absolutely target corruption and waste in the military. The timing for austerity would have been more appropriate in the less adversarial 1990s or 2010s when we weren't facing both Russia and China, but the next best time for reform is now. But if we have a problem, we should go for that problem directly. Fund watchdogs and anti-corruption enforcement. This whole debate feels counterproductive, like the MAGA folks criticizing immigration while simultaneously supporting budget cuts on immigration judges.
They have a near endless supply. How much was it, 1000 soldier died per day? Russia has 20 million men between 18 and 40, assuming no one gets born anymore, at this rate it'll take 100 years before they run into issues.
Irrelevant, you can still send them into a war. A very significant part of the Russian soldiers in Ukraine right now comes from the eastern parts.

Oh there are plenty of issues already, but that isn't stopping them. Let's say they only throw 10% of the eligible population at it, you're still looking at a 10 year war.

If you think you can get 9/10 of a population onto the battlefield you're delusional. If you think you can make more than 1/10 of a population into something more effective than cannon fodder, especially in a single year, you're insane.

But you're acting like Russia didn't also have to deal with covid. Also they were facing a demographic cliff to begin with. Russia had fewer young people and is now burning through them or they're fleeing the country.

Realistically, you only get close to a quarter of the population fighting when the fight is in their backyard.
Female gymnasts can have their periods delayed by years. No joke, depending on how active and intense they train, female gymnasts can have puberty delayed by two years or more. Which depending on circumstances could have a girl at 15 years old, competing in high school gymnastics who has never had a period. "Well, she's never had a single one, so obviously a man. Let's run a series of panels on her and then be baffled by the results.".
Um. How is that any of their business? Fine, you wanna know? I'll wear nothing to the games, and you can watch me bleed all over the place as a play. If they REALLY need to know that info so badly..

Those are both gross, and I hope to hell that's not the reason. Girls have been playing sports with their periods for a long ass time without the schools needing to know that shit. It's a child/teenager medical privacy. And no one beside her parents to and doctors need to know about it.

There are no medical reasons that schools need this information. Clearly it’s so they could suss out transgender people and punish them under the guise of “medically necessary“ information. The panel that recommended this needs to be disbanded and investigated which we all know won’t happen.

No, thank you. The GOP doesn’t want to help to Democrats on things so simple as making sure the people they represent don’t die easily preventable deaths, so why should the Democrats have to solve the GOP’s own pointless infighting?

Here's the thing, if Democrats put in decades of work and political will behind helping a group that's +10 R then they're not fucking helping their voters. If you aren't helping your voters why would your voters give you credit.

Lithium mining is still incredibly dirty and toxic to local environments unfortunately. On top of that, you're making yourself reliant on the next generation of despots as you start running out of domestic Lithium supplies and have to import. The only real solution is Nuclear power.
No one is talking about minituriased nukes for cars, for good reason, and yet our cars use as much energy as our houses.

Nuclear isn't taking off like renewables are for a reason. Some of it is down to unfounded fears, sure, but the main factor is simply that it costs more to build slower. It doesn't offer the same bang for your buck that solar and wind do. Now that's not to say that nuclear is bad or useless, just that as renewables are in this explosive growth phase and continue to get cheaper they're going to justifiably be the focus. Alternatives like nuclear, hydro, and thermal are still important to keep the grid stable because expecting to bruteforce our way to victory using a fuck-ton of grid-scale battery packs is silly. Build some of those alternatives on the side. And if you already have them? Where possible, keep 'em!

Hochul isn't interested in diversity. Just milking the lowest common denominator of division. She's a status quo theist that imagines addicts just need to pray away their addictions. This charade of diversity is ridiculous.

These are. Take all the experts. Racial diversity will probably be close to general racial demographics. Now, evaluate qualifications of potential judges. It could be 80% of the top 100 with the highest qualifications are of country dominant race of the general demographic. In that case if you follow diversity requirements you end up with less qualified staff as you have to pick more folks outside of top 100.

Yep and many people say this is why Russia was so hasty about the war in Ukraine, every 6 months they dont act is another half year of a plummeting population of young people that could fight.
Those Russians fleeing now would of course not want to come back to Russia as long as the war is still ongoing, but people are commenting here as if that was the only scenario possible, thus making the ban of course useless.

People who flee the country can no longer be used to fight against Ukraine. Reducing the Russian capacity to fight should be the priority right now. Sure, it would be better if they started an uprising but most likely they would just go along with conscription because that's much less dangerous than trying to start a revolt. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

Then let them pass through to other countries if they're so paranoid about that. It's not like anybody expects say Lativia to take in all the Russian refugees anyways. Germany's expressed a willingness to hear asylum cases from draft dodgers.

And some countries such as Germany and UK are accepting Asylum applications. I agree your view is common but I would not support that course of action.

Ummm yes, it's 3.7% of the total mobilization with several bordering countries restricting Russian entry which is already significant. Without those controls those numbers could skyrocket. Also that demographic is economically valuable to the state as well so it harms the Russians on that end as well.
Get rid of the gerrymandering that turned some potentially competitive seats into protected Republican seats and we'd already be saying "Speaker Jeffries".
And then after they elect that speaker, a few GOP members change their mind about the speaker for not getting assigned to their promised committees and then vote to replace them, along with the Democrats.

What \will\ teach them that gerrymandering is bad is if Democrats get into a position to redistrict to favor them instead, and that's completely fair game at this point as far as I'm concerned.

Somewhat less likely befeficial scenario: McCarthy trades away some consessions to the Democrats, for enough Democrats to vote "Present", so that McCarthy can get the necessary majority.

However, the Democrats have no reason they should want to help McCarthy, and they have absolutely no reason to trust the Republicans to uphold promises over time. The deal will have to be something tangible which they can receive immediately, such as being granted chairmanship of committess, which would essentially leave the entire sphere of governance out of Republican hands for the next two years, in the case where they give the Democrats the tie-breaking vote in a committee, essentially putting it under their full control.

Very unprobable scenario: Fed up with complete deadlock, some moderate Republican decides to change his party affiliation from Republican to Independent. This would require someone who feels they have a chance to actually get elected as an independent candidate in the next elections, otherwise it would be career suicide, because they would be running against both a Democrat, and a Republican who had a camaign funding fuelled by petty vengance. I can't think of anyone who has the balls, nor the means to do this.
As a Michigander, I can tell y'all that the only reason the Democrats won BIG this midterm was because we passed a prop that has an independent body draw up the voting districts. This is the entire reason why for the first time in almost 40 years Michigan has a blue legislature.
Michigan is fully constrolled state-wide by Dems for the first time in 40ish years. Minnesota is now in a similar place. There is a good possibility the state house of PA will still end up Democrat despite gerrymandering.

We weren't supposed to have a chance of holding anything in Congress. The odds are in favor of Dems keeping the Senate, even without the runoff election that even skeptics are placing in Warnocks favor. Hell, we may even still keep the House, and the fact that that is even a conversation is insane. If the Republicans win the House, it will now be by a razor-thin minority, with a lot of new blood entering the house being Progressive dems and Trump-critical Republicans. That means the possibility of cross aisle collaboration on certain issues.

While it is still too early to celebrate the best case scenario possible coming true, you really are scraping the barrel looking for bad news if you aren't overjoyed by this outcome. The rust belt has significantly come out Blue, with bl8e state legislatures in place to prevent a whole lot of fuckery in 2024. Given the Moore decision slated to be ruled on at the end of the year by the SCOTUS, this could not be a bigger victory.

Progressive ballot measures passed in half a dozen states, including abortion rights enshrined into state constitutions and multiple more legalizing weed or hallucinogenics.
So the software dev field is a bit complicated here, but to generalize it, the more credentials or higher skill the job is the more insulated it is from market effects. It's why the ice cream shop down the street is offering almost 80 percent more than it was 2 years ago but software devs are probably seeing something like a 10 to 20 percent increase (I'm speculating,) but that pressure still exists. At some point there's a potential software dev that stays working IT, a potential IT guy who stays working doing computer repair, and a computer repair guy who stays working at the ice cream shop because of the upward pressure of the wages from the bottom, so it also creates a shortage at the top.
Its literally supply and demand in action. As the population of workers drops relative to the number of jobs, then the cost of labor goes up, since each individual laborer has more options. IF you flood the market with cheaper labor, you can create downward pressure on wages. While its great to keep prices down and get more workers, it kind of screws the people who would otherwise take advantage of the tight labor market.

Notable too that the tech industry has been on absolute fire because of growth companies in the inflationary cycle, there's a reason big tech has been doing TONS of layoffs disproportionate to the market recently, and why the number of openings rose so quickly in the last 2 to 3 years (and it's not just remote work/covid.).

2. I have a friend who runs a surveying company. He can't hire new grads because he pays $2500 a month to start. He has said that he has been told that it isn't enough.

1. I know 6 people who don't have jobs all 6 have said that they aren't willing to work for minimum wage. All 6 have a significant other that works. Money is tight but not that tight.
I believe that making certain guns/equipment illegal it makes crimes associated with those guns/equipment harder to perform - thus reducing said crime.
Isn't the argument for banning things like extended magazines and bump stocks to make mitigate rates of fire and potential damage/harm from the misuse of such weapons - not that they are "scary looking"?

Now that's obviously an extreme example, but the point is that everyone has a "destructiveness" line for weapons, at which they agree individuals should be barred from possessing those weapons, whether they've thought about it or not. My line may a lot lower than a lot of people's, but that doesn't mean it's inherently invalid, just unpopular. There's obviously lots of room for debate on where exactly that line stands (full-auto? Artillery? How about "arms" used in cyber warfare, like viruses? Chemical weapons?) but as we clearly agree, you can easily lose the forest for the trees by fixating on this one particular disagreement, and that's been heavily encouraged to avoid real movement on positive change.

You are choosing to sell your labor to them at a mutually agreed upon rate. Nobody is forcing you to work there. They are not "stealing' shit....everything you described is a voluntary exchange.
Britian made slavery illegal before the vast majority of the globe and was among the first nations in history to do so ever. This particularly impressive given that slavery has been around since before writing and was endemic across the globe.
Britian spent an enormous amount of money fighting slavery across the globe. Regularly tried to enforce slavery bans within its African holdings (yes that's right, the Africans wanted to continue slavery and unfortunately were largely able to) and it's other territories.

Britian set up the West Africa Squadron to hunt down slave ships bound for the Americas at great expense whilst trying to deal with its geopolitical concerns of the time. Britian attacked and destroyed Portuguese slave ships at anchor in Brazil to try to force them to give up slavery.

The British crown shipped more slaves to the Americas than any other company in the history of the Atlantic slave trade. Between 1690-1807, over 6 million slaves were brought to the Americas on British ships. They literally branded the Duke of York into the slaves.
It gives morons something to talk about. They gonna be asking why isn't Biden firing Harris already so he can set up his hand picked replacement now that the midterms are over and Harris isn't who he wanted anyway.
If Biden did anything, it would be resign and let Harris be President to see how she does and then she competes with Democratic field in the primaries.

Biden unilaterally overriding the voters (which I don’t think is legal) to replace the first female VP (who is also a POC) with a slick white guy sounds like a great way to turn off your base. Not to mention it makes Newsom look like he couldn’t win the primaries on his own but needed help to get there. Plus, I think he’s a bad national candidate (I’m a Californian and have voted for him several times but think his inauthenticity won’t play against more competition, and also until the homelessness issue is somewhat solved California candidate will be a hard sell.).

So this idea that would destroy the Democrats’ popularity entirely was written by a former Republican White House staffer… not weird at all.

If a conservative wants to try to sabotage the party that just stomped his own by giving terrible advice, he could at least try to be sly about it. This is just openly partisan and moronic.
