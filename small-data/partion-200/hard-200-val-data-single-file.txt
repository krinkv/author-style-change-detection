At least when you smear one second, you remain within the +/- 0.9 seconds tolerance of a well designed system. But +/- 1 minute in navigation error is over 16 miles. And, it would break some big money transfer security systems.
That's another way of saying that we all better hide for those two minutes. Banking, credit transactions, stock market, computer file transfers, air flights, even a lot of ship traffic in ports, .... they're all going to be really messed up for two minutes. People in cars using their GPS will miss their turns.

We already have very good synchronizing of clocks, that's not the problem. The problem is the damn Earth! It doesn't rotate once every exactly 24 hours (relative to the sun), and yet a lot of applications depend on 24 hours. Such as silly humans, who don't want sunrise being labeled as "2:00 AM". A lot of computerized stuff needs Earth rotation time = UTC time +/- 0.9 seconds (astronomers, and satellites).

I think the earth's rotation and the year are probably the two things that matter most as far as measuring time is concerned.

I would suggest that we replace months with deciyears (36 days per deciyear), and replace hours, minutes and seconds with millidays and microdays.
I think you mean "euphemisms" - when you basically substitute an expression with another that is relatively similar in meaning, but has a much softer or more positive connotation. e.g.: "This isn't a war, it's just a special military operation!".
The whole "false dichotomy" things makes no sense in the context of your post. Are you mad someone is boiling a complex issue into a simple binary option (a.k.a. a false dichotomy) or that you think the word "support" is far too kind and harmless to describe what the russians did (euphemism)?

Seems like it, and yet it would have been so much more concise to write '_Russians killed one protest leader abroad/in Germany_'.

Maybe she was murdered by Putin's people, maybe Putin's opponents are killing Putin's people. Wouldn't be surprised if Putin's gone by the end of the year.

By the time this is over, he might be. Recently one of Putin's close allies was murdered accidentally fell from a window on accident.

I suspect most know deep down that it's a lie, but they want to believe it, because they'd rather not admit they were wrong or that they're supporting bad people.
The first one literally had an abbreviation of "Communist Party of China" written on it in Chinese. I mean, yeah, anyone could technically stick that on a balloon, but who would?
True, China publicly claimed that one. Could be Russia or someone realized "wait, they let balloons through their airspace?" and jumped on it. You never know.

but I agree with what you're saying. if they were shooting military planes out of they sky you'd think they'd be grounding civilian aircraft. Unless of course they're trying to somehow keep this quiet. I'm sure grounding flights would be the last thing they want to do and would be absolutely devasting to the economy and would cause pandemonium. Perhaps they've known about ufos all along and have been trying to keep it quiet bc just that. idk.

I'm not saying it's not. how the fk would I know. I popped up on my news feed and it's on Twitter.. I'm just saying I that I just read an article about it and thats what some people are saying.

There is a law preventing this because that idea is silly. PLACA shields these manufacturers because they are not responsible for anything that happens with that product after purchase, the same as every car manufacturer is not responsible for someone buying a vehicle and plowing through a crowd. Knife manufacturers aren’t responsible if you hurt yourself with a knife or someone else either.
I agree with you something meaningful should be done but I cannot think of an effective solution because clearly Californias hundreds of gun laws only hinder law abiding gun owners and do little to nothing against criminal use of a firearm.

Well it's not legal to leave California and go into other states to buy guns that aren't legal in California, so if you aren't going to obey that law then you might as well stay in California and not obey the law.

They have been out of power in California for a long time, the Dems in CA don't need anything from the Republicans when they can just hammer through any legislation they want. Pretty incredible to blame the other side when you have a supermajority that can't be resisted.
Two Jewish guys from Odesa meet up. One asks the other: ‘So what’s the situation? What are people saying?'”.
Yep. Plus they repeated their own propaganda about Ukrainians so much that they started to believe in their superiority and underestimate Ukrainians. If someone is capable to stop Russian soldier than it can't be Ukrainian...

But all in all, russians are fighting the tenacity of Ukranian people, who're super inclined to defend their freedom to death, their own or their enemy's.

They believe that civilians of Ukraine are just Russians that are waiting for liberation and everyone that fighting them are brainwashed Russians that became nazis and NATO soldiers.

They keep saying they're fighting NATO in Ukraine because that's the only way they can excuse the amount of failure they've had. Russians would not be happy if they realized they entered a 1-year long meat grinder in exchange for barely holding the frontline in Eastern Ukraine.

Russia always lived off the "Don't wake the sleeping bear" propaganda of their army being hyper-macho commandos with giga-hypersonic missiles.
Interesting stat is that the number of kids married couples have is actually pretty stable. The number that keeps going down and down is the marriage rate, and it’s not just in Japan. You have as the biggest impact the positive development associated with the rapid rise in social status and freedom for women, where as previously they were married off as soon as they graduate mandatory education, versus now where the majority pursue higher education or employment. The second biggest impact is that we also have far more entertainment options for single people. No one is spending their saturdays going out to bars to meet single people and have sex when they can curl up indoors and watch a good tv show or movie from their laptop. They can even get sexual gratification from just a single push of the button.
It’s a global issue and the only solution in a capitalist system is to make no changes and be satisfied with becoming a poorer country in the long run, or basically import enough people from around the world to remake your demographic makeup. There are no 3rd options. Robots and automation isn’t going to do fuck all but make like 2 guys in the entire country rich while the rest become service gig slaves.

For me the solution is simple, either robotics will help the shrinking labor force or they are destined to get a piece of karma back. Not working on culture reforms to accept other races sucks when you need people to work in your country.

Japan is one of the most racists countries for immigrants. Immigration will not work. Their economy has been in limbo for decades now after the 1990’s. They import most of their raw materials.
Because they could just leave it alone and focus on real issues. Also, how about just letting go of the idea that “business attire” somehow means a suit and tie.
Men have to wear a suit and tie, always have. Slacks, dress shoes, that sort. If you're not in that attire the supreme court, regular court, state courts, etc would have you removed.

You actually can. Have you ever shopped cheap? Just curious. Just go to any second hand clothing store for most of it, pick up a 40 dollar jacket off some discount rack. Done.

A Missouri representative makes more than an average Missourian does. You can go and get slacks, a shirt, shoes and a jacket for under 100 dollars assuming you buy cheap and actively try to save money. Most employers require more than that for employees. If we're going to cry about price, then remove the damn steel toed requirement for most manufacturing jobs because my boots cost more than a cheap suit does.

Where the f- do you work that your employer isn't offering at least a partial price match for your boots? Have you ever looked through their handbook?
If poor people had access to lawyers like rich people, we’d need 30,000 Supreme Court Justices and a proportional number of lower court judges just to avoid the most simple of traffic fine from taking longer than the heat death of the universe to arrive.
Oh wait… we have an executive branch pushing the idea that a President may not be indicted. The Legislation passed laws to prevent insider trading and are doing everything they can to ensure they can keep that up as long as possible… SCOTUS members aren’t subject to their own ethics rules they set for Justices….

So why don't they just call this out with their lawyers why does it take forever to sort this crap out? Aren't some things in law fairly binary? There are clear rules right? Can't they just be like "Nope. show up on Tuesday cheese dick.".

Thirdly; this entire idea was created from taking a quote from a Virginia governor candidate wildly out of context.
What he actually said was "If a child is born with a terminal and incurable illness, and it will quickly die, then the doctor should respect the parents' wishes about whether or not to put the kid through life-saving procedures which cannot save its life and will only prolong its suffering. The government shouldn't force itself into that terrible situation.".

They characterized it as "he said that kids that survive an abortion should be thrown in the trash.".

Yep. This was also a ballot proposal in Montana that failed back in November. It basically says that if a baby survives an abortion procedure, then the doctors will be forced to deliver it and treat it like any other case of premature birth, or else they will be jailed for five years.

More importantly, what kind of precedent does it set when you allow the murder of a child who is now outside the mother’s body and is capable of surviving on its own and can lead a healthy life but it needs immediate medical attention for it to survive? Do we just let a guy having a heart attack die because no one wants him to be alive? After all, no one wants him and he can no longer “live on his own.” He’ll die without treatment but he could live and continue to live for a time afterwards if he receives proper medical treatment.

I mean, a quick google search can tell you while extremely rare, it is possible for a baby to survive an abortion. It is far easier to destroy than it is to create.
Then by 80s suddenly there was a real panic of American being taken over by Japan economically. That is why media from the 80s (Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, Karate movies, sci-fi novels) all have significant Japanese supremacy etc.
I think the point is what we think of Japan is what we think of China now. Japan used to sell walmart quality crap, now high tech products. The same thing can also (and already partially) happen for China.

China's growth period has past. Population is falling and will halve by 2050. Seriously, half! A crash like that has no equal in history, we don't even have a model for what that does to an economy.

I guess Russia's plan of "we will just buy everything from China and India now" is failing. Especially since China also creates large problems for russian ship cargo certification, since they refuse to accreditate russian cargo and lowered the import of cars and electronics into Russia.

In the recent past, Russia has also restricted the export of some of their most advanced military technology to China, who has otherwise been their largest importer of military equipment.
I often wonder if there will ever be a geopolitical event that India won't in some way blame on the US or UK. I fully expect that in a few years India will claim that the west pressured them to support Russia during its invasion of Ukraine.
The 3 million number was reported by USSR/Pravda in support of India's involvement in the Pakistani civil war (which would have the effect of reducing western influence in the region and advancing the USSR in the cold war).

Bruh. That number is just blatantly false. The H1B program as a whole only has 65k seats/positions available, with an additional 20k for applicants who have completed a degree in the US.
And at uni levels, really all levels, but uni especially, the goal of reading isn’t to agree with what is written, to conform to what it says. You don’t read Frankenstein to agree to reanimate corpses. Rather, to analyze and discuss who wrote it, why it was written, when and where it was written, what else was being written at the time, an analysis of the analogies, the social commentary (without expressly agreeing), etc. Hell, a well-stated critique on clearly defined grounds would likely be lauded.
Students can either select a different elective if a class syllabus has a book they don’t want to read or a topic they abhor, or… nothing requires them to major in a topic they don’t agree with.

I assume (pre uni level) that if a particular parent didn’t want their child to read a given book, almost all schools would find an alternative book for that lesson, or would accommodate in some way.

It’s because parents that are against banning books are working at their jobs, taking care of their children and generally being responsible. The only way we fight this is figuring out how to make it so that people can be responsible AND as loud as republican complainers.

With the Republican party, he has other people doing most of the ground work, but them he puts his name on it.
Honestly I think that’s entirely how the founders intended it. And I know it’s so outdated and they couldn’t anticipate where people would migrate too in terms of population centers like the big cities. They simply didn’t exist back then in the way they do now. That is why I will defend the senate in that regard. I don’t know I’m trying to see things from all sides, at least in the future in this country.
If the gop disappeared tomorrow it would only take about a year to have the division be between central democrats and progressives. That’s my opinion on it.

No chance in hell that will happen, we could increase the house to around 2000 representatives... technically it would only take a federal law to do that, and it would wipe out the small state advantage and be good for politics in general...

If they had wanted this lopsided they would have made it this lopsided, they chose to give small states an advantage, and they would still retain power in the Senate that would balance out the larger states.

As it stands folks in smaller states have way more say in presidential elections than the founders intended. It would just be ensuring equal representation in the house, the Senate would still be tilted toward small states, and small states would still retain more political power per person through the electoral college, even if that edge is lessened.

I agree the Senate is important in balancing large vs small, but that's exactly why the house should function as designed, and provide equal representation Per Capita.
Graduate students aren't herded into a room and basically lied to that their degrees will make paying back loans simple, the way freshmen are (with little to no explanation of the impact of compounding interest), so it's understandable and I hope it works out.
10% is the current level for IBR. What will make a difference for graduate students is the planned increase the threshold of what counts as discretionary income. If that works out, it will lower graduate payments simply because the 10% threshold will be based on a smaller amount of their income.

If all you can afford to pay on your loan is $0 a month, maybe you should have considered a different career track or whether you should have the school you did in the first place.

Endowments aren't built from tuition rates or collected from students; they're funded by donors. But schools should be tapping into them more to help address the rising costs of education.

It did, but the implementation is hung up in court. So it looks like the admin is trying to split the program and implement the IBRP changes separately.
Yes, please! The 50 plus years of embargo has accomplished nothing. The Cuban leadership still kowtows to the Russian and Chinese governments. Perhaps a change in US policy will improve the relations between Cuba and the US and make Cuba more amenable to a democratic government.
Yeah, I cannot figure out if the anti-Castro Cubans in Miami are just dumb as a brick or have succumbed to the Russian propaganda which probably advocates status quo. Cuba is certainly not more democratic as a result of the embargo. The anti-Castro Cubans will have a better chance of making Cuba a democratic state by lifting the embargo.

If the anti-Castro Cubans hate equal opportunity, they can still vote for the GOP and also favor lifting the embargo. Their continued support for the embargo, which hurts their Cuban families back home, is a mystery to me.

The embargo is stupid, but Cuba would still have an awful government and economy without it. The embargo is not what holds Cuba back, not by a long shot.

Cuba's problem is not the embargo. They get everything they need from Mexico and China. Their problem is not to have any money to buy things.
Blatter wasn't in favour of Qatar as a host (he is still corrupt due to other issues) but Platini, president of UEFA was in favour of QATAR. He initially wanted to vote for the US but changed his mind after a dinner with Sarkozy and Al Thani. Just a coincidence of course, like Platini's son getting a well-paid consultant role at Qatar Sport Invest afterwards.
Some Superclubs wanted to make their own Champions League and wanted "to leave" UEFA. Long messy story short: Paris, of course, wasn't interested in joining the Super League and UEFA rewarded Paris owner, Al-Khelaifi, by making him the Chairman of the ECA.

European clubs weren't happy with the Winter WC because it is interfering with their European season. The ECA was flown to Qatar and after returning most clubs stopped their resistance for a winter world cup. Just a coincidence, like Rummenigge, head of the ECA during that time, getting caught with 2 Rolex at customs from returning to Munich from Qatar.

It's even further dispicable that they're threatening to do this because if they don't then them doing it hurts FIFA's relations with Qatar, which in turn hurts FIFA's bottom dollar and we all know FIFA can't let that happen.

It has always been a joke and FIFA has been riddled with corruption but only people are realising it now since it is being held in a middle eastern country.

The plurality of the blame for corruption in FIFA falls on officials who were originally from Europe and/or associated with UEFA. I do think UEFA is the only federation that has enough power for this to maybe work on its own, but Europe has been allowing this version of FIFA to exist since the 70s and its not like there weren't tons of previous corrupt acts. FIFA officials don't even care if you get publicly caught doing corrupt things, as long as you pay them they will continue to re-elect you. In most organizations if you get publicly outed then your done.
States with stricter gun regulation see lower gun crime. Waiting periods for instance are shown to dramatically decrease gun violence.
“Mental health” is the tiredest most hollow refrain from the pro-gun lobby (whose goal is to sell as many guns and gun accessories as possible all the time).

the vast majority of mass shooters are not experiencing a mental health crisis, this is a red herring used by the right to dismiss gun violence. just like they dismiss the suicides by gun as well. since you can't compel someone to seek treatment perhaps making it way harder to get firearms would be helpful. all i know is i have a right not to be murdered while going to the store and that should outweigh someones right to carry a firearm in public.

i live in a place where i have more places to buy guns near my house that i have to buy food. guns are insanely easy to get and that's exactly the problem. the rate of gun violence in this country mostly tracks the increased numbers of guns in US households.
How is she a spoiler for D's? The only group where she has favorable numbers is with R's and they won't won't vote for her en masse over a moderate R candidate. Same with a D candidate who will have Kelly, Hobbs, Fontes, etc. stumping for them. In a three way race she siphons more votes from R's than D's.
To run as an indy she'll need 3% of total registered voters who are not members of a ballot-qualified political party (per ballotpedia and AZleg.gov), that's about 42k+. Obviously, her team feels that's attainable, but where... Also, I can see both parties challenging the signatures to keep her off the ballot.

It seems more like she's banking on the D's not fielding a candidate and letting her run, should she choose. That's the only thing that makes sense to me at the moment. It doesn't make sense for the local or national party to be OK with that as Kelly has won twice, Hobbs has won, Fontes has won, and there are attractive/qualified candidates who could run (Gallego, heck even Hobbs) and her "stance" isn't inline with the electorate anymore.

Perhaps. I don't see it, she's very unpopular with everyone and a Murkowski-esque effort isn't that feasible for her.

If she’s the only candidate I still wouldn’t vote for her. She betrayed us in so many ways after we elected her in good faith. She might as well have an R next to her name.
Actually resolution was accepted with amendment L.52 which inserts a new operative paragraph, reading: “Notes with alarm that the Russian Federation has sought to justify its territorial aggression against Ukraine on the purported basis of eliminating neo-Nazism, and underlines that the pretextual use of neo-Nazism to justify territorial aggression seriously undermines genuine attempts to combat neo-Nazism”.
“Moscow's attempt to exploit the pretext of combating neo-Nazism to justify its brutal war against Ukraine, with Ukraine's delegate asserting that the draft has nothing in common with the genuine fight against Nazism and neo-Nazism.”.

The problem for Ukraine is that the one of their national heroes worked with the nazis and did some nasty stuff, which is exactly why russia has been pushing this motion.

Of course we all know how the equivalent of useful idiots and tankies supported the Nazis, others then supported the USSR , and now apparently they spread Russian propaganda for them.

The Azov group were being retrained and had been out under national command - ironically the Russian invasion and their defence of Mariupol will have actually realised their prestige.

I’m fact the usual suspects are the Azov battalion who were at most 6,000 strong in a total military force of something like 200,000 regulars and the same again national guard? Funnily enough the quest-fascist mercenary Wagner group is actually larger.

Far right Nationalists won a fraction and indeed a falling fraction of the vote in the last Ukraine elections. Far , far less than can be said won in Russian elections!
If they ban social media the kids won't get pregnant anymore. Since social media is how the libs groom girls into seducing their church leadership. /s.
Hm. Well, your first paragraph is the only one that infers the contents of the First Amendment. On it, I'd say yes and no. Thinking about it, I'd imagine the ulterior motive is to prevent teens from accessing liberal viewpoints or safe spaces, but I do feel like there's some implication towards the toxicity social media brings to social status and body issues, with the repeated citation of rising mental health problems in minors.

And yes, they would definitely argue that vpns are bad because it gives kids access to social media, while also saying that vpns are bad because they are suppressing conservative opinions by blocking social media sites without the first hint of awareness of how stupid that sounds.

No they would find out that corporate vpns block things like YouTube, and then all of a sudden it would be a war on vpns.

Do they think that everyone under 18 is just completely oblivious to VPNs? So would id verification have to be for everyone, even outside the state or even outside the US? It seems like it may also end up steering teenagers to deeper more obscure and uncontrolled sections of the web.

Also isnt social media quite literally designed to be addictive, the damage is already done mentally to lots of teens who i doubt would just give up their access without trying things like a VPN. I agree with the idea i guess, but it seems like its about 10-15 years too late, as well as hard to implement affectively.
Filed in federal court on the eve of Election Day, the lawsuit argues that a Pennsylvania state law requiring voters to date the outer envelopes of absentee ballots "has no relevance to determining whether an individual is qualified to vote, in violation of the Civil Rights Act, and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right.".
I take this as they just want to make sure as many votes are counted, because that’s how elections are supposed to work. Throwing ballots out due to a missing date, even though they have been postmarked, shouldn’t affect the validity of the ballot.

So yeah... if you don't think about it sure that totally makes sense to invalidate votes based on a date that's not necessary as they have already been provided before the date.

Yeah dates that are trying to be used to disqualify under the requirement they be received before end of election day. If they are already turned in, obviously they arrived before election day.

I don't think democrats think these are all Fetterman votes, but legitimate votes should be counted either way. I do think Republicans consider these votes to not be in their favor, this being one of many cases they are trying to prevent legitimate votes from being counted in order to try to win in various districts/states.

Not sure the argument is more under the assumption that it will benefit democrats, than it is more the belief that in a functional democracy all votes should be counted, no matter who they are cast for. I agree the right has decided it will benefit them NOT to count those due to the history of the left voting early and absentee. I am a far leftist and believe all votes should be counted even if it will not benefit my side.
Democrats are famously addicted to failure. They’ve shaken it a little recently, but I’d be shocked if they have the ability to be strategic, and I say that as someone who supports democrats.
I know, I’m sorry I was being sarcastic, I’m just frustrated because sometimes it feels like democrats are putting their efforts into mundane elections where they have very little base. In missouri our two largest cities are blue and the democrats barely know what they’re doing here, my city isn’t the largest in missouri and it’s absolutely pitiful. I was just feeling bitter and pessimistic.

So you know the history of slavery in Africa? How so called slaves had rights. And their children weren't born slaves. That most of al slaves were captives of war. That most western/subsara african economies did not necessitate slavery as most were communal socieoeconomical. And that when Africas tried to cease slave trade with Europeans once learning the conditions of chatell slavery they would be either forced into slavery themselves killed or forced to continue to capture?
I already told you my opinion on Slavery, all I am saying is that in this day and age we were taught more of the Europeans doing slavery than what other countries were doing that took part or contributed to this awefull practice.

Well I can be pretty certain that every country in the world (yes even Africa) used or is using slavary at some point even to boost their economy or production.

I dont think that this "but Africa and Arabs learned their lessons and are finally turning against Europe" is as sunny and bright as you portay it. Untill this very day their are still slaves in those same countries, hell they even appear in China and India.

The only thing that changed is the way we see slavary, and also the work they are doing. After that its all the same, no bright future, no leaning, no free time, bad health conditions, difficulty to set them free.
vietnam has CENTURIES of interactions with China, went through many phases, but each time China tried to funny, they have been resolutely repelled.
While about a thousand years ago China did directly rule parts of Northern Vietnam as part of their control over this region, they eventually learned that direct control wasn't the best way to go about 'pacifying' the region. Over time, the tusi system was adopted instead. Under this system, certain tribes and 'tribal nobles' could hold certain aristocratic titles to their local regions and receive the backing of the Chinese state to maintain control. This was very attractive to many local tribal leaders, as they could use Chinese armies to crush their local rivals. While they would nominally have to be a part of China as a whole, they possessed an enormous amount of autonomy and could inherit their titles, something which didn't exist in China proper (officials might hold the same titles their parents held, but there was no guaranteed inheritance). Additionally, Chinese influence in this region was so weak that many tusi chieftains would often swear allegiance to multiple states at once, leading to border conflicts between other powers.

The region of Southern China/Northern India/large parts of northern Southeast Asia, technically known as the Southeast Asian Massif but famously named Zomia by Willem Van Schendel and James C. Scott, is considered one of the least governable regions on Earth. Mountainous terrain combined with a tropical/subtropical climate and high incidence of diseases such as malaria made it very difficult for states of any kind to effectively rule this region. For most of modern history, the Massif was dominated by a coterie of very ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of people, who often lived in smaller tribes and communities. Because of how hard this area was to govern, many bandits and rebels in China (and other states) would flee to this region and use it as a staging ground to either launch a war or simply raid nearby settlements. As such, many Chinese Empires saw controlling this region as vital to their own internal stability. Additionally, this region also had a large number of copper and salt mines, both very lucrative resources in Chinese Imperial history (copper was used as the most common form of currency, and salt was a vital resource in the preservation of meats).

Historically Chinese empires viewed their frontiers as areas of vital national importance. Many dynasties had been toppled or weakened by invasions/conflicts with 'barbarians' on their Western, Southern, and Northern borders. The Southern border, where Vietnam is, had been particularly difficult to rule due to the complicated geography of the region.

The point of all this is that China's historic meddling and expansion in the region wasn't as simple as merely trying to "invade and take Vietnam" for nationalist purposes, something which did happen but was eventually abandoned as a long-term project. It had more to do with the region being a source of both instability for all states bordering it and vital resources.
I understand the circus part of her quote but even though McCarthy is from Bakersfield he’s delivering little to no bread to the common man.
Exactly. McCarthy and Company just proposed a flat 30% sales tax and rescinding income taxes for the rich and corporations. They aren’t handing out bread to placate the masses, they want to make it cost 30% more.

Yeah, McCarthy won 2/3 of the 1/3 of folks that bothered to vote in a district that wouldn’t be red if California hadn’t unilaterally disarmed from political gerrymandering.

One of McCarthy's problems (of which there are several ...) is that while there are about 20 members of his conference from the "nut wing" of the GOP, there are plenty more "moderates" than that (plus some not-so-moderate ones that actually interpreted the 2022 mid-term elections properly, and understand that the voters are sick of the hyper-partisanship that the GOP engages in).

If the Democrats thought McCarthy could be a decent Speaker, they would have negotiated with him (and he with them) rather than forcing him to give a ton of concessions to the most MAGA wing of the Republican party to get the position.

They could, but McCarthy is also from the wing-nut side of the Republican caucus, so unless he suddenly decided to become a moderate, the best outcome is his speakership fails quickly, and some moderate Republicans work with the Democrats to put one of the moderate Republicans in the Speaker position, and then work together on whatever their bipartisan coalition can actually agree on.
The new thing is that they are no longer capable of being in it for themselves, either. They are simply unable to wield power because their internal factions are at each other’s throats.
The Republicans are unable to Govern for a myriad of reasons. The fact that they are debating who should be speaker rather that receiving a dictate from on high and marching in lockstep is not one of them.

If they can’t get together over the Speakership, the next two years will just be a non-stop cat fight over everything and the Democrats will just recruit some of the smarter Republicans to get things done. Because there won’t be a Republican Party coherent enough to be worth belonging to.

Which is not at all something I’d agree with, fwiw, as I linked there’s good reason to think wages go up as a result of immigration, but you can pick your poison I suppose.
I have very good news, which is that immigrants don’t drive down wages for native workers, and probably increase wages for natives. Check out comment I made to another reply. It addresses housing too, which is a separate issue.

Of course not, but immigration has enough benefits for everyone involved to make it worthwhile to ensure you’re building enough housing, which again, you have to do anyway.

2-If we don't have enough housing but we keep increasing the number of people in need of it, there can only be one inevitable result. That's just common sense. And look! That's exactly what happened and now we're all grabbing our ankles while the BoC tries to address a separate but related issue.
Actually in the mid 1980s rents went down after controls were out in place and home ownership was actually affordable.

Here's the thing. Nobody wanted him for the 2016 campaign, either. He got the nomination because, while the majority did not want him, they couldn't decide on who else they wanted. There were something like 9 candidates at the start. 75% of them didn't want Trump, but they split that 75% between the other 8 candidates and Trump kept "winning" because 25% would beat the 10% everyone else was getting because the votes were split between so many people.

Same thing can happen in the next election. That 25% of MAGA die-hards will stick with him and unless everyone else can pick a candidate very early on, he'll keep winning primaries. And the one thing Republicans do well is fall into line when someone looks like they are going to be the pick. Most of those "never Trump" people right now will vote for him if he looks like he's going to be the nominee because all they care about is that the candidate has an "R" next to his name at the end of the day.
Well the US army is under 500k whereas the Russian army on one of their borders has just under 1M men. Their army is currently larger than the US army by quite a bit. Does the US have equipment and manpower to (if this article is accurate) triple the size of their army in less than a year? Probably... Lol... It is however a massive undertaking.
I agree, however Ukraine will run out of manpower long before Russia will... Even trading 20:1... So economic crash is best hope to emd the war.

So instead of fighting the war NATO hopes their economy will collapse or infighting will take them down. Ukraine however cannot replace every combat age man (approx 60k training in Europe amd the US). Ukraine is hoping 60k conscripts will counter the 100k man advantage Russia curfently has/had. (Approx 1M russians to 800k Ukranians). ukraine can maybe squeeze out 1M but Russia will conscript up to 1.5M... Its not an escalation Ukraine can win.

What I want more than anything is for the west to supply Ukraine so it can defeat russia on its own. Ukrainians know what they need to achieve victory, and so far they’re not really getting it.

A 'quick' Ukrainian victory would require direct intervention by Nato. At the start of the invasion, that would have probably meant escalation into a world war, which as it turns out, Russia would have lost (but no one really knew that for sure), assuming China didn't get involved, because a European ground war would be a perfect moment for China to seize Taiwan. Who do you want to feed to the wolves?

It's dangerous to make predictions about China's future. The Party could always be dislodged by some unforeseen, cataclysmic event. But short of that, the surveillance system gives it an extremely powerful tool for maintaining control.

And most of their General KMTs general did not follow orders. -Japan war. I highly doubt China can defend Shanghai and Nanjing. Their troop lack training, equipment, and supply. Some of their troops only carry swords. Western countries refuse to train and equipped the KMT army.
Not even the KMT wants to join the PRC. 80-85% just want things to stay the way they are - unlike the DPP and their Western infiltrators and puppet masters who will do anything in their power to provoke the PRC.

So only half the population supported independence during Nancy Pelosi fiasco on a poll from an incredibly biased source (Taiwan Foundation for Democracy). My guess is in an actual vote they would lose. PRC is Taiwan's largest trading partner (about 40-50%), they are hyper aware of this fact.
the gap left by Russia should be entirely filled out by 2024,and this excludes the effect that warmer weather has had on gas consumption.
by this logic,Japanese households should heat with oil instead of gas,and Japanese industry should have never existed in the first place.

a lot of new LNG capacity will come online in 2023-2024,especially in USA but also in Canada, Nigeria,Mozambique,Egypt.

"a lot" might be relatively a lot compared to previous LNG capacity, but it's nowhere near the capacity NS pipelines had. NS1 had a capacity of 55bcm per year, NS2 had a capacity of further 55bcm. A typical LNG terminals Germany is building has capacity of 5 to 8 BCM per year, and they are building 2 a year now. At this rate we will need over a fucking decade to fill that gap, and we will be paying 5x the price. Also there is that little thing with Germany re-classifying Russian gas as coming from Poland and Czechia because they transit through those countries.

Germany is not re-classifying Russian pipeline gas, and Russia has already stopped deliveries via Yamal (pipeline from Russia through Poland) in 2022….
The Budapest Memorandum pisses me off. It isn't explicit but if 'the west' expects countries to disarm nukes based on protection deals then any and all agression should trigger significant aid.
What nuclear weapons have shown to accomplish is that they act as a deterrence to war in general. Countries which possess nuclear weapons tend not to be attacked in part out of the fear that those nuclear weapons will be used. That has even been a reason for the measured response from NATO about sending aid to Ukraine.

Donating heavy equipment back then might have given Russia an excuse to invade much earlier, and the Ukrainian army might mot have been prepared.

So the only way to protect Ukraine would have been to literally fight the war for them with boots on the ground, US soldiers killing Russian soldiers. No one in Europe would have supported us and it would instantly begin WW3.

It sounds nice in theory, but you have to understand, there was no way to defend Ukraine's territory.

Ukraine didn't have an army prior to 2014 and even after the "Civil War" the large majority of fighting was done by ultra-nationalist Ukrainians who basically funded themselves, which is where you got all these stories of Ukraine being a "Hot-bed for nazis" because the people most likely to be willing to fight are going to be, militaristic right-wing ultra-nationalist.
imagine if Democrats demanded Congress to eliminate tax cuts passed in the last legislative session in order to keep the nation out of default.
Why don't Democrats introduce a fallback bill that does a clean debt limit increase, and when things start to come down to the wire see if there are 5 sane Republicans willing to vote with them to pass it?

In late 2021 Schumer refused to give into McConnell’s demands (similar to what House Republicans are doing now) and once the deadline was right around the corner McConnell ended up being forced to back down and Democrats raised the debt limit without strings attached. He even went as far as to agreeing to a temporary filibuster exemption so that Democrats can raise the debt ceiling on their own. When it comes to fighting for a clean raise of the debt ceiling Democrats aren’t as incompetent as you think.

They will once the deadline actually gets closer. They have until June, no need to rush now. Especially since as the deadline gets closer moderate republicans will start to feel the heat from their donors and will be more willing to negotiate.

Is that really true? I must’ve forgot when Democrats beat McConnell when he pulled the same shit in 2021.
Chinas population struggle will likely be even more severe than in Japan. But this is only a temporary problem, as genes favouring more children will slowly become more prominent.
Even longer perhaps, but those who have more children for whatever genetic reason will become more dominant. These social groups already exist, like Mormons in Utah or in Israel.

There can be a genetic component for example which attracts people to Mormonism. I don't see why outside of religious groups society would not move slowly in favour of those who have more children, and eventually whatever genes cause people to have more children will become more dominant. In fact evolutionarily it should be considered an eventuality, rather than an unlikely outcome. To assume it does not exist in the human genetic genepool already is likely to be false.

Yeah social groups, but you said genetic above. "Have more children" isn't really in the genetic wheelhouse of humans on any societal timeline (hell, I don't even think the needle has moved much on evolutionary timescales).
Unless I’m wrong, Kamala Harris only votes if there’s a tie. Even if Dems are 51 to 49, if Manchin and Sinema are both opposed, that’s still 51 nays to 49 yays, so no tiebreaker vote.
If we have 51 Dems that just means we get to cater to one less Dem, but we’re still stuck between Manchin or Sinema at any given moment which sucks.

It’s a problem with the way the Democrats work in general I think, less so the amount. Anything else than a total majority and everyone can be on the same side and say fuck the republicans, but once they’re in power, someone’s gonna take the position to gunk things up for the rest of them because now they have the power and they can, and the Dems are much less unified than Republicans have been in the past.

And of course, judicial confirmations, leading committees, and at least a chance, however small, of actually passing meaningful legislation even if the Dems lose the House (which it is looking like they probably will, but not definitive yet) because any Republican Majority in the House so far looks to be slim.

You have to take into consideration the trends historically of the sitting presidents party losing many seat and the fact that if thw gop didn't gerrymander every state they could we wouldn't be talking about who would take the house, because the democrats would have easily taken it if not for gerrymandering. Republicans stack the odds in thier favor and still lose. They're a dying party and we are witnessing the beginnings of that.
Among the other prominent accounts suspended were the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, an antifascist group that provides armed security for LGBTQ+ events in North Texas, and CrimethInc, an anarchist collective that has published and distributed anarchist and anti-authoritarian zines, books, posters, and podcasts since the mid-1990s.

Georgia could impose the death penalty on anyone giving water to anyone in line to vote because the water-giver was undermining democracy. Over the top? Look as the collection of Republican clowns with flamethrowers in the US House of Representatives before answering that question.
Complete elimination of ALL CRIME is unrealistic. Lots of offenders believe they won't get caught. They'd still commit the crime even if the potential penalty were death.

To be clearer, if both child rape and child murder carry the death penalty, what's the downside to eliminating the main witness after rape?

The death penalty for child rapists sounds appropriate, and I do believe these people have high recidivism rates, and are not to be trusted around children in any way. However, I also see the reasoning that if child rape carried the same penalty as murder, some of them would just kill the child to get rid of the victim so they can't be witnesses.

Gotta say I don’t have any sympathy for unanimously convicted child rapists receiving the death penalty if a super majority of a jury of their peers voted for it.

China’s exports to Russia has gone down to half from December 2021 to May/June 2022. Not sure if it has increased any substantial amount since then given the trajectory. I would assume China’s oil/gas imports from Russia however has increased at a reduced price that is very benefitial for China and a long term suicide for Russia.

The other side of it is a lot of countries are not buying russian oil or vastly reduced their intake in favour of other sources, meaning the buy from other countries/economies which is good for those economies. Standard market prices haven't dropped so everyone else selling oil is getting their regular price per barrel.

This price cap doesn't exist on any other oils products from other economies, it's purely a sanction against Russia. It's actually good for other economies who buy oil IF they want to buy russian sourced oil, coz they get it at a 33% discount.

The oil conglomerates and other economies generally set a maximum price per barrel they were willing to buy at(if at all) from Russian sources. A price cap.

Generally, oil prices are stable or slightly elevated. Russian oil prices are low. This weakens the rouble and doesn't negatively affect other currencies, so the rouble continues it's decline in purchasing power.
When someone tells you they want to do something awful even if they aren’t able to follow through it speaks to their values and priorities. That this is a priority for the GOP (one of the only actual policy positions they hold) instead of fixing it to ensure current and future generation workers get the full benefits they were promised and have been paying into for their entire lives should tell a reasonable person everything they need to know.
Unfortunately people who are still voting for republicans have a loose grip with reality and can no longer be described as reasonable thinkers.

Edit: You know what it is like? It is like when you get a phone call from someone selling something and they are answering any questions and responding as expected until you respond with something they weren't expecting. They pause and just repeat the last thing that was said, and then you realize you are talking to an AI. That's what debating is like with one of these MAGA people who are obviously just parroting back someone else's talking points. Once you respond with something outside their programming, they pause and then say something really general like how it is a shame the country is communist now.

I then remind him his kids and grandkids are those future generations and that obliviousness or lack of awareness that something was said occurs.

A lot of Palestinians were murdered during the Nabka, so you might have a hard time saying "this is 100% how this particular family was murdered", but make no mistake the Nabka was a horrible, deadly thing.
A portion of the Palestinian population of Israel got mad at the nation being formed, attacked the Jewish population, lost the fight and rather than executing all of them, some of whom had family who'd be neighbors to the people who would be killed, they were exiled to preserve the peace.

People claiming the nabka is ethnic cleansing are the ones trying to justify ethnic cleansing of Jewish people in the middle east in 1948 and on.

For all intents and purposes, the 1948 Nakba was a genocide of Palestinians, or at the very least an ethnic cleansing. Yet, sadly, very few dare to call it as such, despite it bearing the hallmarks of such a definition; it was deliberate, and it intended to destroy the Palestinian Arab ethnicity in part or in whole by expelling them from their homes and destroying hundreds of their villages and towns, leading to the shattering of their society. This lead to the creation of permanent Palestinian refugees with no right of returning to their homes.

If I recall correctly the Jordanian excuse was to give housing to the mass of Palestinian refugees they now had to deal with.

That isn't ethnic cleansing that is mass instability caused by mass immigration and sudden demographic change causing hate and unrest in the populace leading to atrocities like the riots. Blame of which rests on the British authorities.

And the instability was the Hebron massacre and the wave of racial violence in the decades leading up to the 1947 civil war, of which both sides committed atrocities.

The nakba also predates the 1948 war, it was started during the 1947 civil war. Do yourself a favor and actually read up on Israels history.
I don't see Finland saying no (nor "we'll just join with Sweden later") to joining if ratified, but the constantly growing amount of hoop jumping demanded for possible ratification has become too mutch even for finnish politicans.
It’s great how Finland and Sweden are sticking together and everything but I’ll admit, Finland specifically joining NATO would be such a blow to Russia that I’d almost rather defer to Turkey on Sweden if it meant Finland would still join up.

Look at the choice from Finland's point of view: Being in NATO protects Finland to the extent that they expect Russia to attack Finland and puts Finland in danger to the extent that they expect a NATO-Russia war to happen over something else. Given the damage it has suffered in Ukraine, Russia isn't going to have the strenh to attack Finland for years. It's far more likely that NATO will end up at war with Russia as a result of something happening in Ukraine than it is that Russia will invade Finland soon. So, it makes sense for them to wait for Sweden so that Sweden's NATO membership can ameliorate the risk of being drawn into a war with Russia.

If NATO decided to intervene in Ukraine, would Sweden be willing to take the risk of participating in the fighting even after NATO wouldn't have them? What if the war was over Russia's invasion of Turkey? If Finland is in NATO, there are a whole bunch of reasons they might end up at war with Russia besides an attack on Finland, and mutual defense pacts don't cover those.

My answer: because being in NATO makes it possible that Finland will be pulled into a war with Russia. This most likely cause would be if the Ukraine conflict escalates. And in that case, being in NATO without Sweden means being at war with a country with which Finland shares a massive land border and not having the support of the powerful and nearby Swedish navy and air force.

Swedish influence was a big part of Finnish history and I’d like to think that our relationship has been very good at least since after the Finnish civil war and through Sweden coming to Finland’s aid during WW2.

Yes we have, sort of. Finland was colonised and belonged to Sweden for 600 years, until we essentially lost it to russia. After the russian revolution Finland was independent.
It's hardly unprecedented. Get 100,000 of your own men killed in a war no one asked for, piss off the entire planet (including your allies like China) and tank your already-failing economy, and you give a lot of people reasons to want you dead.
Putin clearly had a chip on his shoulder with Ukraine, and felt like he had nothing to lose. (Maybe the rumors of his illness had something to do with that.) I don't think the rest of the Russian mafia state is so inclined, and certainly wouldn't make the mistake of concentrating so much power into one person again.

However what might happen is that a decredibilised Putin or a new leader of Russia would not have the same iron grip over the political class. So a crisis like the would resolve differently. This would mean that other offices of the Russian Federation, that have their own legitimacy, or certain oligarchs that can buy popularity in their own fief, would become much harder to touch for the presidency.

Unfortunately, Putin's subordinates have the power to control the army organizations & Russia even its citizens. What's more, Wagner's mercenaries can kill boldly Russian protestors who wish to push down Putin's regime. But most Russian citizens don't have the guts to try that since they are men in the street, not superheroes. However, Zelenskyy's comment might annoy Putin's psychological status a little by little. If Zelenskyy aims to spark Putin's rage, it would be a successful one.

“While Sanders and King formally caucus with Democrats, Sinema declined to explicitly say that she would do the same. She did note, however, that she expects to keep her committee assignments – a signal that she doesn’t plan to upend the Senate composition, since Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer controls committee rosters for Democrats.”.
This move lets her continue to play "President Sinema", forcing Schumer and Biden to continue to acquiesce to her demands for attention and favorable treatment (like committee chairmanships).

Of course China wants chips. Russia wants chips. Everyone does. No one goes it alone, right now. No one can today. The US is bringing more chip fab back home, but those projects are a decade out, and all it's going to do is make us more internationally shock resistant, not independent. If China and Russia want to do it alone... They just... can't... Both countries demographics are inverted pyramids - they have more older people than younger people. Russia has a population of 143 million, but only 8.4 million between 20-40, and Putin has pledged to send up to 2 million of those to die in a war. There isn't going to be a Russia in 10 years. China isn't faring much better, by 2050 their population is going to reduce by HALF. There isn't going to a China anymore. They don't have enough people left, neither of them, to innovate, because they don't have enough people left to hold their own shit together in the first place.

Nothing about China is what the propaganda would lead you to believe. They're not an economic powerhouse because they're entirely dependent. Their economy only exists by the good graces of the US IN THE FIRST PLACE. China is an empire over conquered regions, they were never unified until recent history. The China you know today has only existed for 70 years, though as they tell it, they've always been this singularly large country.

Their economy only exists by the good graces of the US IN THE FIRST PLACE. China is an empire over conquered regions, they were never unified until recent history. The China you know today has only existed for 70 years, though as they tell it, they've always been this singularly large country.
China, industrializing as hard and fast as they could; in Xi Jinping's mind, a world where he cannot possibly imagine deglobalization, his world which we made on purpose, why make what you can buy? It's cheaper and easier that way. China does participate in chip fab, but all of it is imported, the tech, the materials, the knowledge, the software, the people. Because of Biden's CHIPS act, all of that is gone. And with that, all their supposed innovating that they were doing on high speed rail, for example, all their research, and principally because they decided to build hypersonic missiles so they could target the US if they had to, everything China has ever done to innovate is going to die along with their inability to get anything. They're sanctioned, and now they can't get the software from the US, they can't get the hardware from anywhere else, and the people they relied on were all US - so Biden said to those people, either give up your jobs, or give up your US citizenship.
But the judge specifically channeled the will of our founding fathers, you know those revolutionaries who fought for change and progress to improve the lives of US citizens, and decided they would have been conservatively against change and progress.
The judge, appointed by Donald Trump, said that from a historical perspective the ban was "an outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted.".

Right. And if you look at the last two amendments out of ten, it's a ratified reminder that the Constitution is not a Magna Carta, literally because those debating the Bill of Rights were worried that people would make exactly the error you're making. They went out of their way to try to stop you from making that error, but unfortunately, in order to work, it still does require that you both read and understand the entire Bill of Rights at a minimum. Ideally, you'd also have a decent civics education.

This is one of those areas of the law where the plain text and meaning of the Constitution simply cannot coexist in any coherent, consistent way with the state's desire to make people safer. One of the two has to give, and a shocking number of people on this one issue will suggest that, not only should it be the Constitution, but that it should be the Constitution without a formal amendment having to be ratified.

But you think that pointing out amendments in the constitution shows that the rights aren’t established by the constitution? Good lord, ideally you’d take a class on basic logic before going full dunning kruger.
It's literally what nazis did, as time goes on they keep making the "us" group narrower. Now Israel's new (even more) far right government is straight up saying if you're not Orthodox you're not Jewish enough.
If you tell any right-winged Israeli about how similar their behavior is to countries like Iran, they'll always retort with the same "this is a Jewish country for Jews, if you don't like it you can move".

That means that if every non-religious Israeli took the advice of "just pack up and leave if you're unhappy" the country would quite literally economically collapse.

Which is ironic because, on average, the non-religious Israeli pays 6 times as many taxes as the orthodox one, essentially bankrolling their child support and the paycheck they receive from the government to study the Bible.

If you want to not pay taxes / social security, you have to have lived somewhere else for a prolonged period (I believe about 2 years, out of which 183 days in every year have to be out of country).
How is it possible to believe that she sent those emotional, overwrought texts to Mark Meadows, but didn't discuss anything with her own husband? It's just not plausible.
That's what would happen. The right-wing on the SCOTUS have no interest in lessening their power and there is no mechanism that would keep Thomas off the bench.

Imagine if they tried this and it went all the way to the SCOTUS, Thomas didn't recuse himself, and successfully got the court to drop the subpoena.

In the extremely likely event C. Thomas was involved and there is clear evidence, he should be impeached and criminally tried as well.

The current Supreme Court cannot be taken seriously. It’s members stopped vote counting in Bush v. Gore and one member’s wife sought to play a role in denying the election results. Thomas refused to recuse him from cases in which his own wife was involved.

Why haven’t they questioned him already? Why is he involved in cases related to January 6th when his wife was involved? Why doesn’t he recuse himself?
Permitless carry or "constitutional carry" normally means concealed, but can apply to open also depending on the state.
I only skimmed the article but does permitless carry mean concealed carry? Or are they saying that open carry is now allowed in nearly half the states?

A big trend over the last 5 years or so is for more states to become "constitutional carry" states. Basically, as long as you can legally own a gun, you can carry that gun.

Carrying a gun may be legal, but menacing is not. Anyone who is doing literally anything with a firearm that is not secured in the slightest will have to speak to the police.

Having less guns on the street by making it more difficult for law abiding citizens to carry is not the fix you think it is.

Our laws suppress rights by simply trying to limit the amount of guns in public in the name of public safety while not addressing the causes of violence in the first place. They certainly aren't successful at discouraging criminals who somehow got a gun and carries it regardless.
The glad-handing behavior by telling content creators what they can and can’t do via threatening their livelihood is bad. If it’s not harassment, calls to action for violence, or porn YouTube should stay out of it. Advertisers have to advertise on YouTube. It’s the biggest video platform on the internet. Advertisement is a numbers game. As long as people watch YouTube creators, ad space will be bought. But, if creators are so bogged down with stupid rules that try to make sure everyone is a sanitized, milquetoast employee of weenie hut junior’s, people will stop watching. We are human, we want to watch people who are their genuine self, not some corpo’d watered down version of who someone is.
Swearing is ok. Talking about sensitive subjects is ok. Being someone who doesn’t conform to the mainstream is ok. Being your honest, authentic self is ok. Dissent is ok. If YouTube continues to dangle monetization over creators heads unless they conform, the content will get worse and worse until creators stop creating because they can’t be themselves, and we’ll stop watching because we can tell when someone is being a phony.

we're at a point where youtubers censor themself while talking or say "oh i can't say what i wanted to say because otherwise i get demonetized" or "F....aaantastic!". its so extreme that it is annoying to hear everytime "oh i can't say what i wanted to say otherwise i get censored" etc.. you can't watch videos anymore without hearing it again and again. and as a youtuber its hell to always find out what the reason for it is this time. youtube don't tells you its exact rules and things you need to look out for, so you have to try and experiment for countless hours to find out what the problem is by editing your video to death. it sucks.

i agree with you, some people over-do it. in such cases i think it is okay to prevent children from seeing it (i mean, youtube has a age restricted video feature for a reason). but even if you're an adult and verify your age.. youtube still censors it. they could just restrict such videos (who have TOO much swearing in them.. like 20-50+ in a 10min video or something like that) so only adults can watch them or similiar. but treating adults like they are children who need to get "protected" from "evil things" is just dumb.
Asteroids are waaaaaay more economically viable to mine, and we already have the technology to mine them.
Getting to Mars is a matter of human achievement and research opportunities. There are virtually no economic drivers to reaching Mars or building a base, but we'll do it anyways. There was no economic driver for the initial missions to the moon either.

Ok but you also can't move planets closer to earth. Commercial mining of asteroids would involve first bringing them into earth's orbit, which is actually quite straightforward. We already have all the technology to mine asteroids, it's just not economically viable yet. Meanwhile even getting to Mars, let alone setting up mining colonies is going to be a massive undertaking.

Probably a bunch of gold and other metals on Mars too. Why not? There might not be as much since Mars is smaller and less dense than Earth, but that doesn't mean there's none.

Mars is in space you can literally see it in the sky sometimes, like the Moon which is also in space.

There's a lot of similarities between Earth and Mars, but Mars is like a dystopian, dead and fucked up version of Earth.

Basically, the atmospheric pressure doesn't really matter because it's too cold for the water ice to sublime anyway.
