They were so very lucky the capital Police didnt use their weapons Police have the right to defend themselves, and its illegal to put your hands or objects on a police officer. The police defended as patriotic Heroes. The one person whom was shot was intentionally breaking the LAW and with treats to the lives inside the building. Our LAWS will be followed. Our Police will never be hurt by mini maga extremists again. That Mother did not teach about the meaning and consequences of brainwashing, so i am only am sad about a death not the reason for that death which is justified by the majority of the people. i feel sorry for her and now especially that those mini magas have influenced mom as well. It will be over soon, magas are a small number of brainwashed certain area people whom are easily influenced. and many grow older by the day. BYE BYE evil.

If the public pressure was real Biden would have done this earlier. Instead he waited until basically the day after the Georgia runoff to ensure the 51-49 Senate lead for his party.
The timing is too coincidental. He knew this would be unpopular at home and would be heavily criticized and hurt his party at the ballot box. He does this the day after the last vote is in, announces it and hopes that everyone forgets in 2 years before the next election. The only surprise of this whole thing is he announced in on a Thursday and didn't do the classic Friday afternoon bad news drop.

The whole reason why the deal included Griner and Bout was based on division. Now there are two sides to the whole debate, Democrats who view it as a step in the right direction to help an American who was in need of help from their government and Republicans who see it as an issue that a black, lesbian, basketball player was traded for a lord of war.

The trade couldn't have gone any better for Putin, he received an ally of the Russian government, the US received a citizen in need of help, and now Russian bots can push their beliefs against others they seem undesirable while dividing the US even further over an issue that, arguably, doesn't even matter to the lives of the average American.
When the fascists are terrified that their reign is coming to an end they resort to violence and intimidation, anything to stop the voice of the people.
Unfortunately state run propaganda continues to hide their actions, but we keep seeing the cracks growing.

This is what we've been seeing for the last few months. Both the military and political feudal lords are terrified that the people are voicing their opinion and their uncontrolled corruption may end.

Imran was ousted through a democratic and constitutional vote of no confidence, and he’s been stoking violence across the country ever since. PMLN may not be a whole lot better, but Imran is 100% a wannabe fascist (dissolving the NA, jailing more journalists than any previous admin, attacking the judiciary, etc).

As an American, I think UK politics are more fun. If there were easily available English translations of other European Parliaments, I'd watch the fuck out of them.
As a Slovene, I can say the same. Our dumb prime minister said a while ago that the Western Balkans are on Russia's side. Our dumb foreign minister said there can be no peace or stability in Europe without Russia. We're still waiting for comments from our dumb Karen of a president. It's a shitshow, led by sympathizers of the old communist regime.

I see. Could Croatia confiscate the yachts belonging to those sanctioned individuals at least? And then sell them to the highest bidder and give the money to Ukraine, or something.
I mean, they use the word ‘revive’ here, but viruses aren’t technically alive. It’s a strand of RNA inside a protein capsule that can’t move, can’t eat, can’t breathe, can’t excrete, and only can bind to a cell and trick it into incorporating it’s genetic material into its host, where it instructs the cell to replicate copies of itself.
Viruses need to evolve alongside its hosts so as to keep being able to infect them through the long cycles of natural change and selection. We have a 50000 years a head start on these specific little beasties, so we’ll be fine. This is why new and contemporary viruses like COVID-19 are far more of a threat to us, by the way. They are the kinds that have mutated in ways that can afflict modern humanity and not our stone age hunter-gathering ancestors or our neanderthal cousins.

50000 years ago humanity was in it’s infancy. We’ve had 50000 years to evolve and change and develop. We aren’t the same creatures we once were that made us susceptible to such ancient viruses. It might not even be able to bind to our cell membranes anymore, or it’s genome might no longer be compatible with ours, or it may be extremely vulnerable to our current immune system, or so on.

Honestly I’m just drawing on my fascination and out of school interest in history with my three years of high school biology. I’m not an expert by any means, but I know the very basics as to how viruses work.

But it is like digging up an ancient roman coin. Or a fossil that is really well preserved because it has been buried in sediment for 20000 years. It’s interesting and certainly a historical treasure. But we don’t go around calling it a “supernatural voodoo coin” or “magical zombie fossil” now do we?

What would call opening a tomb of an Egyptian king? It’s a historical treasure that strangely becomes the subject of movies filled with supernatural voodoo… but voodoo is a specific type of dark magic from a specific area on the globe, particularly vile, but not a catch all of evil magic.

You probably don’t have anything to worry about. Viruses are only designed to attack a specific cell or group of cells. And even if this one against all odds evolved to attack or was able to attack one of our cells, it might not be able to anymore.

It is a fact that this shooting will not receive the same news coverage if the shooter is not a white guy. Which is still technically an if but I am highly doubtful he is since there is no mention of the race. If that fact bothers you then your anger should be with the media cooperations who make it so, not my comment on reddit pointing it out.

You’re literally posting in a politics sub. I have no issues improving the voting process, but we have one side claiming irregularities with zero evidence; that is not good faith criticism, that is sore loserism and a lack of respect for our democratic process. Plus they offer no actual solutions, and the plans they do support actively make voting worse for many people.
Probably. This is a country that at one point had a mass compulsory sterilization program in the 1970s. They might not go as far as that specifically, but somewhere close.
Not really. India already has one of the strictest gun control laws. Owning a gun for an individual legally is very very hard. Whatever is being done in Punjab is just to appease people after the outrage of Punjabi singer who was murdered recently.

Compared to Pakistan, India's gun laws have been pretty strict. Under the , which sets up much of the regulatory framework with regards to civilian small arms, ownership is a licensed matter. Under Article 14 of the Arms Act 1959, issuing authorities are granted significant discretion in issuing licenses, and are limited by legislation from issuing anything more than what the law deems suitable for certain purposes. Even shortening the barrel of a firearm requires a license.

Anti-personnel mines are, especially the ones the Russians are using which are just complete and utter war crimes, however anti-tank mines are very cool indeed when used appropriately. Stick 'em nice and visible on a road, now your enemy has 2 choices, use another road, or stay hours at that one cleaning them up, meanwhile your pre-ranged artillery can hit 'em hard.

They are ok, if the mines are actually mapped correctly. For example how to prevent the enemy from disarming AT mines? Place some god damn anti personnel mines around them.
Nah, we just realized there are other things more important than top speed in a fighter. The F-22 can do 2.25, the F-35 can only do 1.6, the F/A-18 can do 1.8, the F-15 can do 2.5, but all of them would demolish Russian planes in actual combat.
That having been said, the F-15, F-16, and F-22 can all still do it, so it's not like it's a rare thing these days either. It's just not really a handicap in terms of actual combat effectiveness either that the F-35 and F/A-18 can't.

Mostly because we realized it's kinda pointless. It takes a lot of fuel and a long time to get to that speed, and in actual war, it's rarely useful. Nearly every fighter and interceptor in Vietnam was capable of Mach 2, and almost none of them ever spent much time even just over Mach 1.5.

I’m aware, but to say Mach 2 is kinda pathetic as if there are planes going faster just simply isn’t accurate.

To anyone confused: type 1 diabetes is generally diagnosed in youth (of course there are exceptions), and ALL type 1s need insulin to live. Pretty much everyone who’s a type 1 diabetic is still screwed, aside from the lucky ones who’ve made it to 65. But that’s a VERY tiny percentage of us.

I don’t know any type 1 diabetics over 65, personally. The vast VAST majority of diabetics over that age are type 2. If they need insulin, I’m glad they’re able to get it now, but this isn’t even close to helping solve the insulin situation for the people that need it most.

But the general public has zero knowledge of the differences between type 1 and 2, and really overestimate the percentage of insulin dependent diabetics that qualify for this .

Yeah type 1 is the genetically fucked not your fault but uncared-for diabetics in the USA. Type 2 are the generally shitty lifestyle types (I know it can be stress, etc but predominantly it's poor life choices c'mon now).
All that ass kissing. If the judge had it in their mind to let the guy off they could at least do it quietly instead this spectacle of ass kissing. If this judge is on the ballot next election cycle and you vote for this clown then you are just as responsible for this crap as the judge and the cop.
Realistically though, how many people are actually going to remember her name or what she did when they see it on the ballot? Probably not enough to matter. I still want to try but it's depressing that this corruption is so blatant and hardly anyone seems to care.

This should not be hard to understand, but voters always seem so damn confused by it. Democrats represent the people regardless of who you vote for. Republicans represent their rich, and often foreign, donors.

Also there are multiple jurisdictions, different investigations and both state and federal charges..

How about we let the investigations finish. We just learned today that Mark Meadows was burning documents. I don't understand why people think they know enough about what's going on. Do you want him arrested, or do you want him prosecuted and found guilty?

That is not how it works. Every charge is separate. You don't have to wait for everything to be complete, you can charge him with what is know now and charge him with the rest later.

Except...... tick-tock, you know? The longer they stand around with their thumbs up their asses, the bolder the wolves become. They have to charge him or democracy is over....and they have do it now. And they have to go after all the government officials who were involved. Very soon it will be too late. The Nazis are practicing blowing up power stations for fucks sake.

I never said that. I said we should let the investigations finish. If they were to bring charges they would. I was trying to explain that we are actually in no position to know what they're investigating, let alone whether or not they're ready to file any charges.

They will bring charges when they have a case that can win. None of us know what's going on or what information and evidence they have.
I hate to say this bc I'm very disappointed, disgusted, etc etc with Russia and cannot stand them, well the government. I wholeheartedly hate them with a passion. But it seems like people should just drop the "whole war crime thing" because evidently not one country will do anything about it outside of some gd sanctions. I get the whole gist that well if the US does something then ww3. I am at this point either do something about with force or quit complaining about war crimes bc at this point I'm just fed up. Obviously not at the same level of the poor Ukrainians who have to actually live throughout the hell day in and day out. I honestly believe its way past time that nato actually steps in bc the only the west is doing is letting this scumbag get away with some of the worst atrocities that the world has seen in a veeeerry long time... From mass kidnapping on a massive scale to bombing hospitals, schools, cancer wards, gunning down innocent civilians standing in line to buy bread and ice, bombing their apartment complexes, raping women and children, etc... I could go on and on for days. I just believe we are at the point its time for the leader of the free world to step up and put a stop to this horrible shit. I'm sorry for ranting like this but enough is enough... Bc i believe just like the whole holocaust ordeal that basically nobody will be punished for these war crimes. I do think Putler is only playing the card he has left and that is saying he'll use nukes. But it's just a bluff. If he was going to do it, he'd already have done it. From what I've read from their leaked reports if they nuke Ukraine then that is basically admitting defeat if they have to resort to such BS like nukes. I say either literally give Ukraine the best of the best equipment that can use with much further range or put nato boots on the ground in ukraine. I believe the only way Ukraine should attack into the Russian borders is to retaliate from where a long range missile was fired then they should have the green light to fire back at said bases inside Russia. It's time to actually put a stop to this sick sorry piece of shit.
Just imagine for one second, how many war crimes are in the occupied areas that can't be currently accessed. I can only imagine and it isnt good. In Izyum alone there were mass graves of 400-1000. Just one town. Id be surprised if the number of rapes was lower.
I mean she handled that case like a pro. But it was also a black and white case. Darrell Brooks is a monster and that’s something both liberals and conservatives agree on. All Judge Dorow had to do was not fuck it up. The bar is so low for judges these days I understand why people were impressed. But the Supreme Court is full of nuanced cases and politics, and judge Dorow made it clear she would bring conservative insanity to that court and any rulings that allowed her own brand of judicial activism.
The latter election is to fill the seat of late-Representative Donald McEachin, who died late last year of cancer. It was called shortly after close of polls for the Democratic candidate, state senator Jennifer McClellan, who will be the first Black woman elected to Congress from Virginia.

Barrett is bad for the court because she's an under qualified puppet that was just picked by Trump getting blindfolded in a room full of Republicans and spinning around while pointing. When he was too tired to keep spinning (3/4 of a spin), he was pointing at Barrett. There were tons of people that deserve the job more than her.

Gorsuch, surprisingly, is one of the foremost experts on tribal law in the US. He will likely side with the three liberal judges leaving Roberts as the swing vote.

He strikes me as a guy who I can have disagreements with but still respect. I personally don’t think originalism is the proper interpretive method for the Constitution, but I understand why Gorsuch does and I don’t think he’s inherently bad for the country the way Thomas and Alito and Barrett are.

On the politically motivated angle, it's was probably about money before it was about a difference in a political opinion. Yeah, nuts are starting to target politicians, not good. But that's not the first thing I'd suspect. She was probably an obstacle to someone. Qui bono?

Well I've not read anything about a robbery, this was clearly an execution. So either it was senselessly random, the result of some personal vendetta by someone she knew, or as you said politically motivated. I'm gonna guess the latter is probably the most likely option.

Am I missing something here, or does this post completely ignore the reality of just about every civil war or domestic genocide or ethnic cleansing ever?
We need to stop demonizing people who we have tensions with and trying to appeal to their more accommodating section of their population and let them lead the change. These people are willing to act as a shield. When the incidence of outrage reaches it's absolute point, it will reflect what kind of change they are willing to fight for. When young jews are ordered to shoot other jews in protest, how will the nationalists deny they haven't murdered their own. The schism is real there and obviously being on the correct side of history feels much more appealing. Let's stamp out all forms of organized fascist conspiracies.

Easy - they turn them in to "others" same way they always do. They're not Israelis - they're traitors that want to destroy the Jewish people and drive us from our homeland. There's nothing new about this playbook, and fascists necessarily don't have a strong relationship with reason or truth. I'm all for supporting local elements opposing fascism, but we need to recognise the steps that are taken to prime people for genocide. Look at the rhetoric of the Republican Party for examples of the spectrum of how this is done - targeting leftists, "sexual deviants", minorities, women, the poor, etc.
Republicans should take a moment and realize, understand that you are the reason Biden is so appealing. Every time you guys boo him and detract from him we ask ourselves why? And when we do we see he's right way too often and think this guy isn't so bad after all. It's hard to complain about Biden when you haven't offered us anyone better. Trump is a trainwreck, an impulsive and short sighted pathological liar. DeSantis is arguably even worse. Try electing someone who doesn't openly despise and antagonise people who are different from them. It's a lot different than Democrats antagonizing Republicans for their beliefs because we choose what we believe. Republicans attack people for being trans, woke, gay, black or female. That's way worse because people don't choose those things.

When I was in Korea, I walked into an establishment and everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at me. The lady at the door pushed me back out the door and said no Americans I understand there are some businesses like this they just don’t want foreigners in their businesses. That’s fine it could have been for their or my safety that I was not allowed there. I don’t really care if I as a white guy am not allowed somewhere no need to get my feathers ruffled I just pretend that the place does not exist and go about my life. Why get upset because a business doesn’t want us there.
Wow, this hits home. I lived in Taichung for 4 years about a decade ago. I've actually been to this bar a few times, but never had issues there. There is definitely a weird vibe in Taichung bars, for some reason. I always heard stories about gangsters taking offence that some white guy had tried to dance with one of their girlfriends and beating the hell out of every foreigner in the bar as a result. "White guys cause problems" might be the other side of the story, though. I doubt the bar will be able to get away with this for long.

I question whether or not the reactions are massive enough, honestly. The very best case scenario for this is they are trolling some 3D chess move into a news cycle and treating the legislature like a circus. Worst case scenario is that they don't think she's insane.

So you're saying "both sides are the same"? Both sides are equally bad? Gotta disagree buddy. The party putting on the circus instead of governing is not the same as the party calling out the circus.

Virginia's 2nd District: Luria (D-incumbent) vs Kiggans (R) - It's a toss up, so if Luria wins, it's good news for dems. If Luria loses outright, it is a bad sign. If it's too close to call for a good chunk of the night, then things are going about as expected.

Virginia's 7th District: Spanberger (D-incumbent) vs Vega (R) - This is a +6 Biden district and Spanberger should win the race. If she loses, it's likely going to be a bad night for Dems. If it's too close to call, then that's also not a great sign. If she wins, things are looking okay for Dems.

New York's 17th District: Sean Patrick Maloney (D-incumbent) vs Lawler (R) - Sean Patrick Maloney is the chair of the House Democrats campaign arm and is unexpectedly facing a pretty close race. It's a toss up right now. If he hangs on to his seat, that's a great sign for Democrats.

Michigan Governor's Race: Whitmer (D-incumbent) vs Dixon (R) - Whitmer is expected to win this race, which should bode well for down ballot candidates. Keep an eye out for how close it is though; if it's in the low single digits, then that suggests a better night than anticipated for Republicans.

Watch Miami-Dade County in Florida. If it stays blue, that's a good sign. If it goes red, that would be the first time in decades. The margin is important.
I wouldn’t be so sure of this. Georgia’s population is highly concentrated into a few cities, which skew very democrat. For example, 50% of Georgia’s population lives in the greater Atlanta area and an additional 5% lives in the cities of Macon, Augusta, Savannah, and Columbus. Judging by vote recipient for down ticket offices is not that reliable because as a Georgia voter myself, many of those candidates run unopposed and many voters do not view these offices as political in nature. I have no issue voting for a republican coroner even though I am a pretty staunch democrat because it’s not really a political office in any meaningful way.

States that had a Republican governor running for re-election tended to outperform nearby states. Had governors like Kemp, DeWine, etc. not been on the ticket I suspect the outcome would've been different.

Hm, almost like every state and locality is different, and candidates should be running based on what their electorate looks like instead of mirroring national platforms.

A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.

It was extremely effective in 2012 (based on the 2010 Census and the gerrymandering done from that), and got republicans a 33 seat lead even though democrats received 1 million more votes overall than republicans did.

While it must be acknowledged that the Dems do this also, it would be disingenuous to claim it’s truly a "both sides" thing. Yes there are Dem jurisdictions that pull this shit too, while too a much much lesser extent.
This speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese governance. The ones with true power, like Jiang, don't need to hold office. Jiang stacked the party with loyalists so he could be certain he would be able to continue influencing politics despite being formally retired. Xi needs a third term because he lacks a clique he can continue to influence upon retirement.
Despite no longer being general secretary, Jiang still remained in charge of the military during the first year of Hu Jintao's term. Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference.

Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference. A WikiLeaks transcript showed Hillary Clinton informing her private audience that China's foreign policy was ultimately controlled by their military establishment, not Hu.
If you criticize Xi for underhandedly cementing power by enshrining Xi Jinping Thought into the constitution, you should also criticize Jiang for doing the same when he enshrined his "Three Represents" ideology into the constitution.

It's much more complicated than that, and not at all like the Jan 6 event in the US, because Jiang still had power after officially leaving office, where Trump had only influence.

Political cults like Falun Gong are not new to China. The Taiping Rebellion was started by a political cult, and more people died in the Taiping Rebellion than in WW1.

Falun Gong is China's version of QAnon. China's solution was heavy-handed, but most Chinese would argue it was necessary to prevent the unrest we in the US have to deal with due to our political cult, QAnon.

They weren't a political cult, either, they began as a spiritual movement and were forced to take a political stance by persecution.

Jiang (and all Chinese leaders) are not afraid of religious movements in general, they are afraid of any institution that threatens the CPC's authority over China. Most sects of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity are tolerated, as long as they keep they promise to never question the CPC or discuss political issues. Tibetan Buddhism and Islam in Xinjiang were suppressed because they were afraid of separatist movements. Jehovah's Witness was banned because it taught its followers to refuse to swear allegiance to a specific nation. However, Hui Islam, Mahayana Buddhism, and the Catholic Patriotic Association are tolerated because they don't conflict with the CPC's political agenda.

A foundational belief of Falun Gong is that the CPC is illegitimate, so it's not a surprise they got suppressed. I'm not shedding any tears, it was an insanely racist cult. Li Hongzhi is not an idiot, he knows he can't actually levitate, he's just making this stuff up to build a following in order to influence Chinese politics.

His "ability to maintain good relationships with western powers" is BS. He oversaw the third cross-strait crisis. The only reason you don't remember the times he disagreed with the West is because we never took China seriously as a potential peer competitor. Back then, we could silence China's disapproval of a Taiwanese leader with a basic naval exercise. Jiang and Xi's policies towards the West haven't changed, most of the change comes from the West not being as cooperative because it realizes China is an imminent threat to it's hegemony.

Never thought I'd see the day where Westerners praise Jiang. Just goes to show how easily Westerners forget about the past to eat up the new narrative about why this time, China's leader is really bad.

Jiang had a unique view of the US. While he believed the American values were incompatible with China, he still respected America. He memorized excerpts from the US Declaration of Independence and Gettysburg Address. He was the last mainland president to go on 60 Minutes. Jiang cared less about ideological purity, and more about understanding the values of other countries. That is what sers him apart from the current general secretary of China.
Of course I want NATO and the US to supply Ukraine with even more and it is frustrating to see them refuse to supply long range munitions while my relatives have to hide in the basement from missile strikes, but I'm also grateful that NATO and other nations have provided so much and continue to assert their support for Ukraine. If support was not provided - both when the war started in 2014 and when it escalated in 2022 - I know that people would have still fought against Russia but it would have been even more brutal and difficult for the people to stand against Russian imperialism.
But at least the average Russian knows what they're dying for. Palaces and yachts that they'll never be allowed within 20km of.

Do newer spellings with "ê" have the same pronunciation as the antiquated version? I have no knowledge of French pronunciation, but I'm assuming it is just a spelling modernization, like an Eszett in German?
Well, there's something to learn when relations start to deteriorate like this. (Aside from the motive, just to focus on the sanction itself. Maybe after this Brazil will rethink their dependency regarding the supplychain for key items(the context is unpleasant, but the opportunity to learn is still here). Everybody gotta be as self-sufficient as they can. Also, I don't understand the reasoning for that move by Germany. I think I understand what it is meant to signal, but not the reasoning itself. But it is what it is. Seems like they aren't gonna do business as usual to countries that don't send weapons to Ukraine. Rather harsh(especially form Brazil's perspective), but hey, at least it further motivates much needed discussions inside Brazil. So far I focused on the impact to brazilian industry(just a topic that interests me for a handful of years already), but some discussions are also being held regarding Brazil's position in the war up until now.
Didn't Dire Straits once approach a police officer and ask for help stating "we're in dire straits", but the police officer hadn't heard of them and thought they were actually in some sort of emergency?

I live in Georgia and feel the runoffs are gonna be closer than they should be. How do you reach Republican voters that are voting for Walker despite all of his issues? I know several people that are voting for Walker simply because he’s a Republican, even though they can’t stand him. They think Warnock is automatically worse than Walker simply because he’s a Democrat.

Also, given that this race could give Democrats an edge in the Senate, GOP Georgia voters may be more energized about making sure that doesn’t happen and that’s a big driver too.

Nice to hear from a Georgia resident! Yes, this is shaping up to be a SO close - if current polling is accurate. I don’t have any suggestions on how to message to voters, but midterm races usually draw voters who are party loyalists. Those are the folks who turnout. That could be part of the reason why republican voters are supporting a candidate who is not traditional.

Yes, but you've told us that what you hear directly from voters is far more informative than "current polling"!

What is the back-back-back story of Walker getting into the race? He is so obviously inappropriate for the position, yet he has had enough support to give him a real possibility of getting into the Senate? How can voters equate a football star with the intellectual acuity necessary for a position in Congress? What does it say about Georgia voters in general that someone so inadequate can be elected?

Nice question, the quick answer is you go into the interview with your facts ready as much as possible! This has always been an issue for most reporters covering all sorts of topics. The best way I’ve learned to combat it is to re-ask questions, point out the facts and sometimes ask them to share where the info that doesn’t seem quite right is coming from. I think most political reporters (especially those of us on-air) are aware that spin almost always happens, so be ready.

Honestly, the polling in this midterm cycle fascinated me months ago. There were trends in places like Washinon state and Iowa where senators deemed “safe” were seeing mixed polling of being far ahead and then being down significantly.

One thing that I kept thinking about on election night when the red wave didn’t happen, is a conversation I had with a political scientist who pointed out that polling might be off and continue to be off, simply because some polls haven’t caught up to the reality of how we live. Many people don’t answer landlines, making the pool of respondents far smaller and less diverse, so you might not get a good gauge of voter sentiment. On top of that, there is also a phenomenon some have mused that you may have people say they will vote for Candidate XYZ when asked over the phone by a stranger, but that may not be the reality when they actually get to the ballot box.

The bottom line for me as a journalist has always been that polls can be a tool to keep in the back of your mind, but go talk to voters and listen to what they are telling you.

Unfortunately, yes, I’d say we are all more aware of this type of violence than when I started my career. It’s something you do keep in your mind when on certain assignments. It’s also really important these days for many reporters to seek training on how to handle it.

It appears he has property in Georgia and Texas, that’s what we know. We also know he has said he lives in Texas publicly, in speeches and campaign events. I’m interested in hearing what Georgia voters tell us about how much of a concern this is. For instance, we saw in the PA senate race that some voters there said they were troubled that Dr. Oz Mehmet who had a house in NJ, wasn’t a real resident. Historically, other candidates have had to answer for similar multi-residency issues. I’ll also point out an interesting constitutional tidbit- you must live in the state you are representing at the time of your election. Not necessarily while running for senate election. So I’m not sure his TX homeownership disqualifies him, but this is a story I’m following.

On one hand, some Georgia GOP voters have said they like Walker because they know him from his football days, they think he’d be a fresh face in the Senate. People often like political outsiders who don't have conventional experience. But - there is indication that republicans in Georgia don’t want to see another seat go to dems and that is likely a significant part of his support base too.

Georgia voters keep showing they aren’t tired yet! The latest numbers from the first days of early voting over the weekend broke state records for turnout.

Great q. I do think there has been a proven purple trend in Georgia because we’ve seen it for a few cycles now and doesn’t appear like a fluke. A big part of the trend is that Georgia has experienced a population growth of younger and more diverse groups, due to metro areas like Atlanta being attractive places to live.

More diversity and youth in your pool of voters makes things more competitive during election time. Younger people are also less inclined to be party loyalists. I point out this trend in a recent story a few weeks ago.

This isn’t to say the purple will last forever in Georgia, but it is a phenomenoon has kept us on our toes over the last few years.

I think this might be a particular race where we don’t see the election denialism narrative as much. Walker has said he’d accept the results of the election and he doesn’t seem to be running on re-litigating 2020 like others have.

I think with many of the more vocal election deniers losing their races earlier this month, republicans might not want to make that a central theme in this runoff. But, of course, that narrative is still out there.

The likeliest outcome is Dems lose the senate, but a 50/50 split would not be out of the question and honestly more likely than maintaining a 51/49 majority given the map.

I don’t think there has been a single poll where Sinema gets more than 20% of the vote. Schumer and the DNC need to stop caring about that traitors feelings and back Gallego. There damn near no pick up opportunities in 2024 and a lot of opportunities to lose, I get that. But Sinema is clearly not popular in Arizona as she is receiving less of the vote than Kari Lake in hypothetical 3-way races.

It's not that people don't give a shit. It's that they don't believe there is a legitimate way to get rid of the criminal organization that has hijacked the sport globally. Boycotts don't work with the mafia.
in all honesty. if people would see the effect or their doings, like boycotting the world cup mayn more would do. many jsut dont do it because they always think their boycott would not change anything and thats why they jut dont do it. its the same with environmental pollution or just throwing some garbage onto the street. very shotsighted but thats how majority of people are.

Again, it's a transparency issue because we're used to seeing a President's tax return every year. The fact Trump never released them indicates he has something to hide, which wouldn't be surprising given the mountains of scandals surrounding the guy since 2016 and even before.

Don't really get it myself. My best guess is it tells exactly what he made when. Giving a very good idea of his actual net worth. He likes to pretend he's a brilliant businessman. Tax returns would summarily end or vindicated such a notion.

It sounds like the person you replied to was speaking generally, and not necessarily that the US has the highest standard of living. Regardless, just like there are quality of life differences between living in different parts of Europe, there are big differences between different US regions and states (many of which have economies and populations that rival whole EU nations). With regards to metrics, many US states rank high and compare favorably, but the overall rankings are often dragged down by certain states. My own experience as an immigrant to the US with family friends in various parts of EU, UK and Israel is that the US is still one of the best places to live, especially for immigrants.
I can't imagine how utterly delusional you have to be to say America has the highest standard of living in history. While yes, you can't compare the Taliban and the GOP, America sits in the mid-twenties in every ranking of Quality of Life, even ones made by Americans. Among western countries, america is one of the worst places to live.

The reality is, if he was on the ground and couldn’t call out for help for a while after falling who knows how far and his official Twitter is asking for prayers for the family, I don’t think his prognosis is going to be good. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone of course, but they are treating this like something incredibly serious. I guess we will see tomorrow.

Discussing politics, the ebb and flow of the house membership could have significant ramifications. If Steube is medically sidelined, Devolder/Santos ejected for an illegitimacy (certainly possible), and Virginia replaces McEachin in February, that's 220-213. For something like raising the debt ceiling without having to mint a trillion dollar coin, convincing 4 Republicans to buck their party might be doable.

Biden doesn't write legislation but he sure influences what goes on that floor and how people vote for it and don't you forget it.

On Tuesday night, Senator Bernie Sanders withdrew a measure to end U.S. support for the Yemen-Saudi Arabia conflict. President Biden stepped in, reportedly vowing to veto the measure if it passed. Two California senators declined to support it and although two Republicans publicly were in favor, Sanders withdrew the measure because "the votes weren't there" for a bare minimum 51-vote passage.

Never trust when someone gives you that lame line about Biden's inability to influence legislation or policy because it's absolute bunk.
No, they've been sending lost of their own fairly-limited equipment stocks to Ukraine, as well. Poland sent virtually all of their T-72 tanks at the start of the war, several NATO members have severely drained their stocks of SPGs to equip Ukraine, all kinda of tech, maintenance, intel support has been provided by virtually every western ally, and not even mentioning all the consumable materials sent by basically everyone, MREs, water, basic infantry equipment, plenty of small arms, probably almost every kind of missile launcher ever made in some quantity or another, and all that's just off the top of my head.
Attack, no, but an emboldened Russia with a significantly increased influence sphere, with Ukraine's population, heavy industry, farmland and heavy industry can do to fuck shit up for the rest of us here in the region in myriad ways. They don't have start launching missiles to terrorise its smaller neighbours, and given the history of our countries, the way Westerners poke fun of how Russia can't bake a cookie without it being somehow defective, guess what. Mismanagement and sabotage are devastating, too.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

It's massively important that one of the liberal justice candidates wins, but it will still come down to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of independent state legislature theory it could allow the Republican majority state legislature in Wisconsin to not be able to be stopped by the Governor or state Supreme Court (if it is flipped to Liberal majority) and give them sole authority on drawing maps and potentially how elections are carried out (and electoral college is decided).

The GOP Senate Majority Leader in my State House got busted about two years ago driving drunk in the middle of the night the wrong way down an interstate at excessive speeds. He even tried to outrun the police. When he was finally pulled over he was extremely belligerent and verbally abused the arresting officer, but was released almost immediately on his own recognizance upon being taken into jail.
Ukraine stops about 80% of these or so so while they can keep doing it the payoff is small considering what they are losing in stopped missiles. It comes down to attrition, how mich can Russia resupply and how fast can Ukraine rebuild and how much material do they have.
These exist and are called mobile substations. They typically are used to take a substation out of service for maintenance. Getting 6 million people back on in 24 hours seems like transmission line repairs to me. It’s an insane amount of customers to get back on in that short of a timeframe.

Almost all of the times you are going to do scheduled maintenance on a substation you don't use the mobile substations. Those are reserved for emergencies. Usually you would simply reroute the power through connections and then disconnect the substations.

From experience i would guess that Ukraine probably got the majority of the people back on the grid by rerouting via connections, ehich id usually done quickly and with remotely operated devices. Then they probably had to patch up the holes in the grid in certain places to get the rest of the people back up.
Remember when the WHO determined that stress from fear of radiation caused more adverse health effects than radiation from the plant? Same thing here. It's fear of the scary word "radiation" that threatens the fishing industry.
I used to be a carer for a guy who worked in Libya does system stress testing stuff. His colleague was instructed to go into a reactor or something of the sort to do some tests. He had a geiger counter and it started reading really really high levels of radiation, indicating a radiation leak.

He was in an area which was supposed to be shielded so was not wearing radiation protection, so he evacuated the area. Extensive investigations took place and it was determined the geiger counter itself was faulty.

However, although the man was not exposed to any radiation, he lost his hair and developed a multitude of benign tumours around his body.

The plant is on the seashore. Dumping it inland would require an enormous amount of energy to pump it uphill, not to mention the pumps and system of pipes that would need to be installed. And it would just run downhill into the ocean, anyway.

In a moment of crisis the police (in Colorado at least, we're not Texas) wants to neutralize threats and people with guns and not in a uniform are immediately assumed to be threats.

Let us also remember another true fact. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R. CO) never graduated High School. She literally just got her GED only very recently in 2020. She is THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD... with no actual diploma, and a representative of our country.
Does the world want a new China though. The existing one became quite problematic when it got powerful.
The main issue with india is the lack of infrastructure. They would need trillions of investment to compete.

Takes time but India will get there. China has ONE moving part and that's CCP. India otoh jesus Christ. I'd root for an open democracy anyday over a covert and malign authoritarian regime to flourish.

It won't be easy because Indian infrastructure is garbage compared to China. It will be impossible to create efficient supply chains from so many factories in India.

But I suppose none of that matters as corporations will just buy from the cheapest country anyway. (Edit: Or maybe not, all eggs in one basket approach has shown itself to be problematic. Guess it will depend on how much risk vs low prices corporations will accept.).

On its own side AKA only caring about yourself is pretty much the definition of not being a team player.

You are like the football player who refuses to pass the ball because you want to score and pad your personal record, who doesn’t care about how other players on the team feel, or even if it means your team is less effective - i.e. not team player.

I'm about 50/50 that there is something interesting in there, or he's just such a petty contrary asshole that he spent 6 years and who knows how many campaign dollars fighting it just because the other side wanted them.

1. It's mathematically impossible for you to get too big of a raise or bonus, get bumped into a higher tax bracket, and lose money overall for the year. I don't care who told you it could happen or who you think it happened to, if you believe it than you haven't done the math or don't understand what the math is telling you.

2. When republicans say "cut taxes", they are talking about income taxes. You likely pay mostly payroll taxes, so you won't see much if anything in savings.
Poachers in the sanctuary are clearly heavily armed dangerous people. They do need to be dealt with as such. However, the problem of poaching is not going to resolve by killing them. It will reduce rhino deaths, but also escalates violence and puts even more people at risk, because ultimately the poachers aren't doing it because they want to kill rhinos or because they don't fear the consequences, they're doing it because it is extremely lucrative in a place where making that kind of money can be otherwise impossible. The problem of poaching will only be resolved by not making people so desperate that they feel like the risks of poaching (or the risk of joining gangs that will fund themselves with poaching, which is ultimately a similar problem) are worth the rewards.
I don't know the situation but from the same article, locals living near the park are getting caught in the effort. I would imagine not everyone is aware of the defined borders of the park and people may be getting shot for simply being in the wrong area.
