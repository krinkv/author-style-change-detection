My goodness. The poor woman can’t even get her thoughts out she’s so stricken with grief and the very same ghouls who helped incite that riot are up there trying to shake her hand.

Exactly. If Sicknik had "recovered" that day and been back in the hospital a few days to a week later, then sure, I can be sympathetic to his argument. But that didn't happen and they're talking out of their ass.

Essentially, if someone commits a tort, like assault (say, aggressively yelling at someone and putting them in fear of their safety), and the person being assaulted has a fragile constitution (say, a nervous disorder resulting in a weak heart) and that tort causes the victim harm due to their fragile/special condition (say, a heart attack), the assaulting party would be liable for damages stemming from their tort which resulting said condition.

Challege accepted. In California alone, there's so much land in the San Jose area, South of San Jose regions, and South Bay. Apple, and others, have built large campuses, and there's so much open space that can be annexed. Not to mention other parts of Northern California one or two hours of San Francisco, or in the Central Valley Sacto region. Nevada has many options as well.

unconstitutionality-signaling too, in this case. Luckily his base only cares about one amendment to the constitution and it’s not this one. They claim to care about 1 too, but that’s only when compelling other parties to publish their speech.

Selective populism. Under fascism, the “voice of the people” is not the democratic majority, but only the voices of those who support the leader.
The state of ME did try something however: They passed a law forcing cable companies to offer their services “a la carte.” (Fox is the second most expensive channel after ESPN. That's why boycotting advertisers on Fox won't work, the majority of their money is from cable fees. A la carte theoretically might limit their reach however.).
Dominion has been able to show that major players at Fox effectively knew the stolen election story was BS and Fox editorial based their publishing decisions on viewership, not factual accuracy or judgment on who they thought was correct at the time. The fact that Fox was this sloppy in their communications have actually built a pretty strong case for Dominion that I think has a shot of winning in court.

The AI then deduces that people that were in "women's chess club" are bad candidates. B/c it turned out you were generally hiring men. You don't have 100K resumes from a non sexist system, so you have to manually filter out the word "women" as something to judge on. You repeat, pulling out biased filters until you think you're done. Only... it's more likely that the AI just started keying on biases you don't notice either than that it's actually doing it's job right.
TL;DR You ironically have to be MORE diligent against bias in an AI than you do in normal people, since we at least have decades of practice and intuition in detecting human bias.

One of the biggest challenges with AI is that it has a huge tendency to pick up unintentional bias. Companies have wasted millions (probably billions) on various scrapped AI programs that ended up being unintentionally biased. . AI criminal justice has been shown to be racist against Black people.

Republicans remain confident they will narrowly win the House, but several key uncalled races, particularly in Western states, are breaking in favor of Democrats, giving the party an outside shot at retaining control.

hello everyone angel here. i run the washinon post's reddit and i'm sitting next to sean sullivan who has my phone and airpods in for this talk. gonna do my best to chat with ppl down here/toss in any helpful midterms-related links over the next hour. thanks for joining in!
Responsibility and being responsible are two contextually different things too. Responsibility is nothing more than a consensus on the understanding of future consequences. Being responsible however is the result of that understanding or lack thereof.
You can argue he was oblivious to thinking through those consequences, or simply did not care, but those consequences occurred nonetheless, making him responsible. Thus also, why it should have been his responsibility to anticipate those consequences if he wanted to avoid being responsible. And here we are.

Snowden acted entirely independently. It'd be a different scenario altogether if for example Greenwald had pressured Snowden into obtaining the NSA data and supplied him with password cracking tools in order to clandestinely gain access to secure data. Because of Assange's involvement with Manning in obtaining the data, he moves from an investigative journalist into a co-conspirator.

It's difficult to say if Manning would have committed the espionage without Assange's direct involvement, whereas with Snowden, he had the data before he ever met Greenwald.
For these types of businesses, there is less likely to be new entrants into the market and they are likely to be subsidized by the government when necessary. Publicly traded companies go under all the time. You rarely see a bankruptcy in a capital intensive and economically critical industry. It does happen - see GM. Investors in old GM got wiped out.
Yeah, like electric cars are heavier than ICE cars, because the energy density requires a greater volume, so not beyond the realms of design, but certainly not a simple drop in replacement for previous tech, we need to accept that shit is going to physically change with regards to anything that needs to cover distances pure electric can't meet, as I've said previously, you're going to have to accept the efficiency loss as well.

So. . . instead of adopting a known technology that Japan has been successfully operating since 1964, we should instead invest tons of money and energy into unproven hydrogen jets that are still in the experimental stages?
I still think it’s Newsom, despite his baggage, possible Pete, but there is an unknown bullpen most of us plebes don’t know about. Either way Biden will say he’s going to run until he says he’s not. If he says he’s not going to run, it will only happen when there is someone ready and waiting. I think it’s 75% Biden runs, 25% he passes the torch to someone who has tested well, been vetted. Then again, you are listening to someone who thought there was no chance they would cancel Roe. So essentially I don’t know shit.
I don’t envy any GOP candidates strategy for 2024, I mean how exactly do you contend with trump literally owning the base while actively courting his cult while simultaneously kissing his ass and trying to make the case that you are the better option for the presidency? All the while being paranoid that Trump says fuck it and poisons the well or splits off to his own party.

NPD is a mental health condition, being a narcissist isn't. We only diagnose something as a mental health disorder when it inherently causes distress to the individual. If someone's narcissistic behaviour is working out for them, or their perception is still so fucked that they cant tell that their narcissism isn't working out for them, than it doesn't meet the criteria to be a mental health disorder. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a classification specifically for the people who realize they have a problem but are experiencing distress from struggling to adjust their behaviour. This gets fuzzy when people mis self-diagnose their narcissistic collapse as depression and seek treatment for depression. But generally a narcissist who is still endorsing their grandiosity is not considered mentally ill on the grounds of narcissism.

No experiment, document, person providing contradictory information will change their mind. Worse, in some cases they cannot handle the challenge to their psyche that they become belligerent and aggressive.
Side note regarding California affluent homeowners protecting their assets... California's abandonment of single family residential zoning theoretically should address affordable housing. This program is several years old, but has yet to take off. In my conservative neighborhood on Nextdoor, a a recent discussion about building an auxiliary dwelling unit turned into not so veiled threats from other homeowners. Although a zoning variance is no longer needed, ADU permits are still required to ensure compliance with building safety codes. The city makes ADU permit applications public on the internet which strenhens social pressure to not address this housing crisis.
Really well-written/researched article. I agree with the author's last statement as well - the leadership required to fix this hasn't been imagined yet. Grappling for position has left us completely unable to solve shared complex problems like poverty. We can't even seem to talk about them without talking past each other. I appreciate the facts that I quoted from the article above. But facts won't get bitter people to suddenly accept change. They need to be heard, not lectured at.
But beyond Reddit, imagine doing a search for, say, election candidate policies. All the major reputable and/or neutral news sites have decided to charge for link shares, so they disappear from Google/Bing/DDG/etc search results. The results that do show up are now, naturally, from sites that chose not to charge for link sharing, which would likely be from sites that do not require sustained traffic revenue to keep functioning (say, sites that get their funding from rich right wing oligarchs who are fine dumping pocket change into a site that actively spreads false information about policies they are against).
Yes and no. Fake news coming from disreputable or propaganda sites is a big problem on Facebook. That content will continue to flow like the mighty Mississippi. What will be put behind a paywall is legitimate news by organizations that, rightfully, should be compensated for their professional journalism.

as a physician- I rely on the vaccination for peace of mind. I dont have to freak out everytime I see a sick or old person (which is every fucking day). It isnt perfect but it is the best the modern world has to offer.
I mean, my reasoning is quite simple - considering the amount of harm done to the relatives to Sunil Tripathi for example, despite him being completely unrelated to the crime he was accused of, I much prefer to avoid such situations happening to me over being safe from some random murderer I could be more likely than not in any way able to screen using the internet anyway - and that's already assuming that the prison rehabilitation system is useless and he would try to murder more people.

Yikes! I get being against the mandates, and I understand them only being able to charge her for the 6 incidents with actual evidence.. But holy shit snacks, this is so messed up. Get the jab or don’t, I don’t care either way, but don’t deny thousands of others the medical care that you are obligated to provide. Fuck her.

Understanding logic and personally insisting that your ideology is updated to reflect actual scientific results can help solve this.
But isn't that a tactic to figure out the response time of your enemy? Couldn't the Russians divulge the capability of our response by how long it took and how far they could push before they got the call? Risky maneuver but if you were assured an enemy would have to call you before they launch a perceived counter attack wouldn't you like to know where the line is? Russia sacrificed those men in the first battle to see what would happen if they fucked around, well they found out. The second incursion was to gain intel and posturing, after they learned we weren't playing games anymore. I'm just an armchair tactician so I'm just blowing smoke, I couldn't really tell you what happened or why but you should always give your enemy more credit than they deserve. Russia is still a nuclear capable country and that should give us a bit of a pause before all the dickswinging gets started.
American-residing Pole here. Anyone who thinks we would have a "morale problem" while facefucking Russia doesn't know a thing about our history with them.

If a population cannot replace itself from a wide enough gene pool then it ceases to exist. That is the doomsday scenario.

It's not a problem. It just kind of means you lost. Game over. What's the point of survival if you're just gonna end your own bloodline? Like, why continue? Just seems kind of a waste of time, honestly. Unless you're gonna do something big to make your mark in the world another way, but I doubt you're gonna do that. The reason we're here is because those before us reproduced so that we may do the same. It's kind of the purpose of an organism, you know?

No, at least not directly. IMO it has more to do with businesses gouging everything child related. Cost of raising a child on China is ridiculous right now, especially considering the level of income.

Am i wrong? The only distinction between the two parties is their views on race/lgbt/abortion. While that is a huge distinction, their economic policies are largely the same. They both want an authoritarian police state run by the military industrial complex and big pharma. Vote in truly progressive candidates and ill change my mind.

Sure we can sit here and hash out the minutiae and talk about how mainstream conservatism willingly took this poisoned pill--and kept taking it, and taking it for years leading up to this point--but the continued use of the label "conservative" gives MAGA Republicans the convenient façade of a traditionally accepted ethos in American politics when in reality they are anything-but "conservative".
I dont think anyone expected from India or other developing nations to put sanctions on russia, thing is increasing trade of oil by 23 times starts to look like war profiteering, and less like just keeping pre war trading status quo.
You are quite correct. What they can do and likely are doing is significantly reducing CapEx. That can bring down the cost of production significantly below that 60 dollars a barrel and increase cash flow but this is a temporary solution and will still eventually cause damage to the fields while creating a maintenance cost that will need to be paid at a later date.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying Russia will cease to exist any time soon. That would be crazy talk, because that's not how money or national economy for that matter works - at all. The question however is, in what form will Russia exist in the future? How will people live there in the near, middle, and far future? Will they be independent or massively dependent on someone else? Will they be a global power or no power at all? Will they be off better or much worse than before the war?

If it came down to it and Russia collapsed, China would be rushing in to grab as many pieces as possible. Having them for an ally is like having a hungry tiger as a guard animal. It’ll turn on you as soon as it’s convenient.
Russia has significant internal geopolitical issues which it cannot reconcile with democracy and capitalism (hence always the Strong-man approach to governance). Look into the vulnerability of the Eastern/Southern cities and their complete dependency on Moscow for subsidies. Until these cities have better access to trade/goods from the southern borders, Russia as the super-sized state will always fall behind in some way. Additionally, suppose the eastern/southern cities of Russia happen to get access to international trade/goods/warm oceans. In that case, their respective republics will likely try to break away from Russia, as they will no longer be dependent on Moscow. Russia has A LOT of issues which not easily resolved. Also, keep in mind how much coercion and soft-power Russia attempts on former Soviet states, e.g. Azerbaijan, Armenia etc.

Yeah that’s how I took it. “Handling” nuclear powers also doesn’t really seem wise. A lot of people I’ve noticed have a bit of a hard for this sort of thing since Ukraine.
This guy had nothing to say about stimulus checks or unchecked PPP loans, but woah, try to help students who are crushed by lifetime debt, during a global slump caused by the disaster of the Russio-Ukraine war and that's just too far. TOOOOO far. Doesn't qualify as disaster relief.
And why? To own the libs and please their billionaire overlords? I don't understand what this accomplishes at all besides guaranteeing a generation will hate you the rest of their lives.

As it's becoming obvious that Republicans will relentlessly throw infinite lawsuits at this preventing it from ever happening, if I were president, I'd go scorched earth, "Fuck you, ALL future payments and interest are suspended indefinitely The next Republican president can choose to publicly ass rape you and undo this suspension".

Chinese citizens can't access the BBC in China thanks to the great firewall. You have no idea just how totally the government controls the information landscape in China; it's not about if it is possible to circumvent through VPNs, messaging apps, and the old rumor mill, but rather the fact that the entire information landscape will be shaped towards party interests. You won't know what you don't know.

Good idea,. Lets see now a well regulated militia lets make sure every gun is registered after all if we are going to kill off amendment to the constitution the 14th a right to privacy is not going to be the last.
Ok so the article explains, saying how drivers for taxi-vans and busses are getting Karma—bc they apparently suggested? the transition to only-ruble be pushed forward early (was supposed to be next year), and now it was decreed last week that hryvnias are strictly forbidden, but there’s just nearly no small bills in rubles floating around. (Implies that at least some drivers are collaborators.) So the very ones pushing are now forced to break that same law. The grocery stores are also divvied up—and the ones the Russians frequent don’t even have adequate rubles. They posted on door yesterday—it was notable bc said Russians had to see posting that change would be in hryvnias, despite new law being implemented.
Escalating is COMPLETELY irrelevant. They cannot be negotiated with. They will never honor any peace agreement, the same way they did not honor any of the previous ones.

Bruh.Dmitry Medvedev's predictions are bordering on schizophrenic paranoia. In what weird world do they think Germany is going to become a fourth reich and people will go back to the gold standard?

These modern ones, such as what the US uses, are great for monitoring (and controlling) any intercepted communication waves - military movement, political satellite-based phone calls, traffic abnormalities in monitored hot zones - they have built-in radar, dampening, are entirely self-sufficient, and are far beyond the range of most modern aircraft!

Nope. An apartment sized balloon traveling on jet streams that can reach 275mph at 65,000ft would require a Sidewinder to kill to ensure the kill and minimize hazards to the aircraft. A Reaper UAV could carry Sidewinders but it can only travel 200mph at 50,000ft. They'd need to arm an RQ4 Global Hawk to have a chance at reliably killing that balloon with a drone, and that's only going to save them $60k per flight hour and provide little meaningful training as a Global Hawk will and should never play its role in contested airspace anyway. We're designing a drone for that, the Loyal Wingman, and it will be neither cheap nor ready in a year nor have simple kinetic weapons, only missiles, which I remind you are the only reliable way to shoot down massive balloons floating on jet streams of up to 275mph in the stratosphere. The missile cost more than the flight time in probably every interception this month. You're not getting a gun lined up on a wildly unpredictable flight path of a lighter than air balloon.
The complaint that they are legislating from the bench is valid. They fucking lie in order to create the legal reality their ideology calls for. They outright ignore the fact that the Constitution explicitly states we have unenumerated rights - specifically, we have every right we can think of as long as the Constitution doesn't bar it. So the original argument that we have a right to privacy is a Constitutionally valid argument even if there are better arguments to be had (like an absolute right to bodily autonomy.).
Do you think the apathy is also a result of a coordinated effort to damage concepts around the role government can play in people's lives, and possibly partly a result of a similarity coordinated effort to degrade the quality of public education in the US?

That part isn't true. The clause they cite includes that federal law overrules them. Agreed on the rest though.

Trump's continued sabotage was probably instrumental in Putin's plan to steal Ukrainian lands. With all the sanctions and world political opinion being against their aggression, Putin definitely has a vested interest in getting a puppet back in office. But the Christians have been so evil that they've driven an increase in voter turnout and invoked the survival response of the civilized portion of the population. They just couldn't wait to piss on the Constitution and attack human rights. They might have squanked by on voter apathy in 2016 with targeted social media manipulation, propaganda, hacking and suspicious elections in GOP-held areas, but even cheating wherever they can, they aren't able to overcome people actually voting.
Super Tuesday was March 3. Of 15 States, Biden won 11, typically taking 35-50% of the vote, and Sanders won 4, taking 36% in California to Biden's 27%, 37% in Colorado to Biden's 24%, Utah taking 36% to Biden's 18%, and 50% in Vermont, to Biden's 21%. An March 4, Elizabeth Warren dropped out and endorsed Biden.

Matt is a toddler. Recall the time when he mustered some of the other psychos to storm the SCIF where the intel committee was holding depositions related to the infamous trump/zalinski call? “I need you to do us a favor though”? Yeah, Matt thought it would be funny to disrupt that deposition and order in pizzas - postponing the committee by threatening the Capitol police guarding the SCIF, entering the room, holding a pizza party, and requiring a subsequent 8 hour long sweep for electronic devices because they broke every security protocol with that stunt. He’s a congressman that wants to be an internet influencer. It’s all performance with that clown.
I just don’t know Russia’s end game here. There is no way you are going to hold a conquered region of people that despise you. There will always be partisan activity and it will always cost more to hold than the value received from the land in the long run. And now they have to foot the bill to reconstruct everything in the land that they’ve destroyed, try to make it habitable, and do all of this under the most crippling sanctions ever placed on a country. Somebody help me understand.
None the less, personally I would say that IF the west keeps ratcheting up support at their current rate, it seems likely that we are close to the transition point where the increasing sophistication of Ukrainian hardware and tactics coupled with Russia's inability to maintain their munition burn-rate (missiles/artillery/etc) and their declining equipment quality and sophistication leads to a situation where the Ukrainians are consistently generating more combat power than the Russians are and are therefore capable of mounting offensives like Kharkiv and Kherson more regularly.

It can go one of 2 ways. Putin acknowledges that he's done for and he has failed because of the invasion of Ukraine, so he'll either say fuck it to keep control of everything and let nukes fly, OR he'll be killed for his massive blunder that kneecapped the already bleak future of Russia.

What I see is Putin ends up dying for being outed as a weak and failure of a leader, and Russia as we know it will fracture (again) and we'll see even more pop up nations take root, the issue with Russia as we know it collapsing is those that will have control of the nukes afterwards.
Orbán not having much bargaining power is not going to stop him from trying. He has made himself the pariah of the EU, his only time he has any leverage is when he holds a consensus-requiring process hostage. At most, he may not publicly hold it hostage.
Sweden was providing around 10 million euro a year to Turkey through Sida (the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) even before the earthquakes, with 94% of it going to reform work (including developing infrastructure, helping with climate work, improving education, strenhening equality and human rights, etc) and 6% going to humanitarian aid.

I wish. Hungary is too insignificant for that. At most, they'll find something to get Orbán to capitulate quickly. Orbán is hoping to hold the application process hostage in order to get some concessions from the EU.

This is likely going to happen because Orbán has done this before within the EU, where he holds an important process hostage in order to gain concessions for his regime. We seen it happen under COVID and under sanctions. This is the only position Orbán has left within the EU where he has any negotiating power because he has systematically destroyed almost all of Hungary's diplomatic relationships within the EU.
They specifically wanted to have an easy fight against a weaker opponent with no chance of defending itself, but now that the bully has failed he has no choice but to essentially scream "nazis!" at everybody in a bizarre real life invocation of in the hopes that people somehow don't realize that Russia itself has become almost exactly like Germany was 80 years ago. Basically even Russia knows that what it's doing is ridiculous, but they are forced to keep trying because Putin was too weak-minded to back down when he still could, his system of government completely fixated on proving itself correct in an argument they knew they lost a long time ago.
The blazes you say! Why surely Russia (or the USSR) would never make a treaty with a place like Nazi Germany or a person like Hitler, and if they did then that treaty would never be to divide up an innocent country like… hmm, let’s use Poland as a completely random example - so it would never be to divide up an innocent country like Poland between the two of them.
Far in the future, when people look back at this time, with all the crazy shit that has happened in the last deacde, Putin's invasion will stand head and shoulders above everything else in the catagory of "holy shit, that was dumb" and thats in a universe where the leader of the free world told us all to drink bleach to cure a disease...
I agree. However, despite remaining optimistic, I doubt that will be the case. Most anti-war protests have been “settled” by brutal oppression and mass incarceration, which is not something an average civilian wants, understandably so. Also regarding the civilians, a lot of people in Russia support the war due to being brainwashed by the state media. As a person living in an ex-soviet nation, I can see this phenomenon happen around me everyday and it is TERRIFYING how easy a grandma is made to believe that it is good to sacrifice her sons for a cause that is in truth utter bullshit. I do wish that you are right though, and people are able to stand up for themselves and for their country in the face of this tyrant.
Granted, the article ignores the fact that the sub-$1 per hour pay is only part of what a prisoner gets from the state. There is also food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. You're saying that the sum of these parts equals acceptable compensation for holding a prison job, even one that could prove fatal as in the case of fighting wildfires. However, to pay anyone other than a prisoner to do these jobs, the government would have to spend a minimum of three times what they currently spend merely keeping each prisoner alive. The fact is, food, clothes, shelter, and medical care are part of the minimum quality of care the government is required to provide prisoners. So the pay prisoners receive for working - which is a small fraction of minimum wage - is given for doing jobs that the government couldn't get any free citizen to do even for minimum wage. Which is, in fact, a form of slavery.

So many folk on the horizon... my wife and I each have five siblings, and they have 10 children between them, one of which has three of her own. I think I've spent more on gifts than on rent this month, and I hope to retain my Best Uncle Ever title for the 22nd straight year.
My main symptoms that sent me to the doc were: crazy heat intolerance, debilitating fatigue that had me bed/couch-ridden and avoiding even drinking anything at times because I didn’t have energy to get up to pee, intractable insomnia, periods of days to weeks of not being able to eat solid food, excessive sweating for no reason (I begin dripping sweat just standing up for more than 60 seconds), tachycardia upon standing (my HR would be 170-200bpm after a 7 min shower for example), random sudden bouts of high blood pressure that would then go away just as quickly, gastroparesis, vestibular migraines that felt like carsickness on steroids and made it literal torture to move, dry mouth and eyes, trouble emptying my bladder, difficulties regulating my temperature, horrible brain fog, and more.
Yeah, was going to mention this but you got there first. The idea that "the blacks" would take a train, walk to their house, break in, make sweet love to one of their relatives, steal the precious 50 lbs television, walk back to the train carrying it and board the train to ride back downtown. Possible ? Yes . Likely in the real world? No. Edit: pronoun consistancy.
Well, I live in PA. I dropped my mail-in ballot in the mail Oct 23rd after obsessively ensuring that every little thing was done correctly. As of today, it hasn't been received. Too bad, I'm told. Go to the election booth and fill out a provisional ballot. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid. But you know what? I'll go. No way is my vote being missed. I'll fucking be there.

Exactly. Less likely to be caught up in a dumb lawsuit trying to get my ballot tossed out if I vote in person. That option isn't available to everyone though.
Thanks for the link, that article is an amazingly comprehensive look at not only the current balloon situation, but also the military response, the different airplanes used to respond, and a history of previous balloon sightings.
Find a cat. Make a suit so the cat can survive high altitudes. Make sure to modify the suit so it's claws can still be used. Tie cat to a drone. Fly that cat towards the balloon. Balloon pops. We hold a parade for the cat.

Nah they're publically for sale, is government loves selling these abandoned military sites to insane bunker builders and they live in the middle of nowhere and quickly realize maintenance on these sites is impossible so basically they're mold and mildew infested traps with very shitty ventilation because they're built to prevent Nuclear fallout.

That... Sounds perfect. I have an instrument I need to make first, got the plans and everything. Guess I should get on that. If I don't get it done in time, I'll think of you playing for us both when the time comes.
Seeking asylum requires those people to cross into the country they are seeking asylum from and isn't a crime and doesn't require any paperwork to be done before crossing into the country. It's been established international law for a very long time and only the last pos who was in power tried changing the way it's done by purposely bottlenecking the process causing additional human suffering to gain points with equally pos people.
What should a Christian act like? If they behave as Jesus preached in Matthew 5, 6 and 7, sure. They chose the pieces of the bible they want and then cram it down our throats.

"These agreements addressed a national agricultural labor shortage during WWII and implicitly, they redressed previous depression-era deportations and repatriations that unjustly targeted Mexican Americans who were U.S. citizens. Upon its termination in 1964, the Bracero Program had brought more than four million Braceros (arms) to work in U.S. agriculture and on railroads."

1. the german military/police would have overwhelmingly supported the coup is basically 0 (individual soldiers have a constitutional duty to fight all threats to our democracy, so a general would have been shot by his subordinates before whole divisions just followed traitorous orders) the danger was that a KSK supply officer was part of the coup and could have been funneling military gear to the traitors.

They aren't titles. Noble titles do not exist anymore. They were merely allowed to enter "titles" as part of the names on birth certificates. Whoch necessarily cannot work like actual noble titles which change throughout a person's life when parents die or they marry. (from prince to king etc).

I think they will. Bankruptcy courts don't typically leave stones unturned and even when they do, you only make it harder for them to look the other way when every single thing you do with your money is ostensibly illegal. They will fuck him, or they will fuck every single person attached to him. The strangest part of all of this is the bubble of protection Alex Jones still appears to feel he has. His veneer is so thin. He tells the whole truth by how shitty he is at lying. And still. He feels vindicated and like he's fooled everyone and as if he's going to win. But he's already lost. His attorney handed over AJs entire phone backup... He's lost this and probably 50 things we don't even know about yet lol.

Interesting take. Good way to show they have no clue what the case is about, but interesting none the less. Stupid for sure, but still interesting.
The UK and french did give a shit to the extent that no one power could dominate the region. Take Iraq for example, split down the middle between Sunni and Shia with a small minority in the south. They invade Kuwait because although they do have oil the way their borders were drawn up meant they had no deep water ports. Kuwait exist solely to deny them this.
Hyperbolic and oversimplified. I can put words in your mouth too. America is not the world police but everyone seems to want us to be but also mind our own business. The truth of the matter is that every country is out for their own best interest.

There's another major faction in Syria, Rojava, an autonomous region that is theoretically democratic and secular, and was previously US-backed until Trump withdrew support from them after a call with Erdogan. Kurds are the main ethnic group associated with Rojava, and Erdogan hates the Kurds. Turkey's main ambition in its recent meddling in Syria has been to extinguish Rojava.
Yeah remember when Biden had to be ordered by the DoJ to rent apartments to black people and still refused? Or when he cheated on his pregnant wife by raw dogging a pornstar and paying the hush money with campaign funds? Or when Biden was legally prevented from operating a charity because he used it so fraudulently? Or when Biden bragged about getting away with sexual assault? Or when the 25+ other people came forward with stories of being assaulted by him? Or when Biden called the American armed forces “losers” and said he trusted Putin more than his own government? Or when Biden lied about the severity of a global pandemic to try to keep his rating up, and refused to west a mask, worrying it would smear his caked on make up? Or when his exact words were quoted by multiple mass shooters? Or when Biden suggested we listen to a doctor that claimed Covid was made from demon sperm? Or when Biden plead the 5th over 400 times in one of many many fraud cases against him?

For instance Gay marriage was a big divide in the friend group at one time. My religious buddy felt it was not up to the state to permit marriage (he is Catholic) that his faith does not permit (at least that is his reading of his faith I am not educated enough in catholic religion to know). My other buddy said that the law should allow civil marriage to any couple over 18 - that lawful marriage is a right separate from the sacrament of marriage as Catholics see it. That settled the issue for them - religious folks can ‘keep’ their marriage based upon their faith, and limit it to those who practice the faith. But for civil marriage, the law must (and should ) treat all adults equally, so gay civil marriage should be allowed an celebrated. It is a fundamental right the state should recognize. And sure each faith can limit marriage to the couples their faith allows (or some religious allow multiple spouses - which the law does not allow) as that is a religious thing between the members of the faith and their god(s). And thus educated men and women - dear friends - talked through an issue at the time was very controversial and ended up agreeing and being civil/loving. I leaned so much from these discussions. I think all Americans can do so, too. No?
Conservative principles are fundamentally asymmetric. The law is supposed to bind the "outside" groups and protect the "inside" group. Resources are allocated to those that "deserve" it.

No. There's no serious effort to start, and, lose a 2nd Civil War by any politician from the South(MTG excepted). But, it is the 2nd century of those clowns frothing up their citizens to keep them too occupied about that to realize that live in states with the poorest, least educated, unhealthiest citizens who are also the least likely to personally succeed, no matter their color.

What?! Nikki Haley is seriously trying to defend the indefensible? This is why people need to actually look into a politician's history before voting for them. It's sad that she didn't see the harm in celebrating Confederate History Month and defending Confederate symbols, which are divisive and have been used to promote white supremacy. We should all be striving for unity, not furthering hate with symbols of hate. Let's move forward and leave these horrible symbols behind.

whilst the democrats advocate the outright mandating of the vaccine under threat of losing their jobs, being evicted from their apartment/rental property, being segregated in public places like Jim Crow, being ticketed or outright arrested and imprisoned for not getting the vax, being disallowed entry for emergency medical treatment at hospitals; All of those things were advocated for by democrats to be implemented and enforced by the state and you wonder why the conservative base was not convinced by republican official to get it?

It is theirs to cut. That’s why we elected them (or more probably, why we elected representatives that will not cut it).
In any army, a ton of manpower is spent on non-combat roles: truck drivers, military police, construction, guarding supply lines, and also patrolling and protecting the country’s borders. With a peacetime army, I’d be wasting trained soldiers escorting supply convoys, protecting rear areas, and just loading and unloading shit on and off trains and trucks. If I had a ton of new conscripts, I’d put my conscripts in these roles and move the trained soldiers to the front lines. I’d also use conscripts to guard non-conflict borders and move the combat troops from there to the front lines.
Of course, what I said above is only if there’s still professional combat troops available. If all those are gone and they’re truly scraping the bottom of the barrel for every last man, then yeah, they’re pretty much fucked.

There is collaborative evidence. Circumstantial granted, very circumstantial. Some alleged captive Russians that decided to fight for Ukraine did a press conference thing. They wore ski masks and didn't identify themselves so at best they are ATM, alleged Russian turncoat/s. It seems they may be operating as a detachment within a larger unit. I think most likely propoganda but it is a possibility none the less.
The only thing can do is make DeSantis “look” weak to have a chance to win the Republican nomination. Doesn’t matter how weak the Donald is, by the transitive property, DeSantis (aka, DeSanctimonious) would be seen as just a trinket Donald collected and pulls out of his pocket to spite on his way to the nomination. For DeSantis to win, he has to point back to “Sleepy Joe” (aka, Dark Brandon) whoopin’ his ass and all his disciples. If DeSantis wins the nomination, Dems point to him as Donald Trump, Jr-Jr and connect all three to be of the same moral cloth of lesser and lesser quality and prone to failures and indictments. Tie them altogether so that one’s downfall is all of theirs. Connect them against their will and the harder they try to separate themselves, the tighter they make themselves. They’re all blow hards that point the Republicans the wrong way while they squabble and muddy their waters for voters to split. Sow the seed of the path of the Third Party for trump and DeSantis to take, keep the pressure on and let their platform fragment together because they’re still interwoven to each other. DeSantis doesn’t have a chance without the 2016 Trump dna in his platform and the more he turns on DeSantis, the more DeSantis’ platform gets denatured. What does Jr have to do with all of this? Jr is a barb of misgivings that when mentioned with daddy or desanctimonious will slowly implode the runners the closer they get to Election Day. Make it so that when either make an announcement, Donald and Jr-Jr made it together, make no distinction between any of them, they are a United front of a three-headed beast that speaks more desperately to be heard over the roar of the next head, a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, in the end, signifying nothing.

I’ll happily take that timeline, we’ll see which representatives and people running are completely insane right off the bat, the republicans would have a hard time holding a majority as I’m sure any representatives a part of his maga party would see them as traitors and not work with anyone, it’ll be great!

Yea I know. I still don’t think he’ll be do a coup. Even a soft coup. He may very well be part of a dark time, but I don’t think he will outright end the American Experiment. I obviously will oppose him. But I’d rather be fighting him than Trump.
I can't stand it myself, I find it lazy, unoriginal, repetitive and infantile. It's literally used every couple of weeks to describe some new shitshow dolt45 has created.

If Trump killed and ate a baby on live TV two years ago, there would still be senate committee hearings and DOJ reviews today where everybody would be “collecting the evidence” and “interviewing witnesses” while this shit sock is waltzing around free randomly mentioning how it wasn’t illegal for him to kill and eat a baby but also denying he knows anything about ever having eaten a California cheeseburger.

Iran has been trying to get the S-300 // S-400 // Russian jets, which would make things a lot more dangerous for Israel. It wasn't long ago that an Israeli F-16 was downed by an S-300.

This is nuts… nick Fuentes catholic nazi incel with a frat boy Hawaiian shirt wearing cult following has stated not wanting to be with women makes him even more heterosexual… milo an outspoken alt right Greek/Brit provocateur who dated or was married to a black man and fresh off his Marge Taylor green internship and ye a black man from Chicago’s south side rapper/fashion designer owner of some jim jones type shit academy that has a basketball team recently divorced from the kardashians who is hemorrhaging cash at the moment and running for president, having dinner with trump on the patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean not far from the Kennedy compound in palm beach with a bottle of fucking ketchup and a well done steak… can some one draw this cartoon up.
Yes, one would think. So that leaves you with two likely possible scenarios here. Either Trump’s campaign and security is utterly incompetent to even do a 5 minute Google search. Or, Trump fully wanted to meet with a NeoNazi, not anticipating that wasn’t a popular move, and is subsequently lying about it.
Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death,” is a former Soviet military officer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization.
No. Russia’s government is absolutely disgusting. Not to say every government doesn’t have its fair share of corruption, but taking prisoners and sentencing them to a decade of hard labour, purely for the purposes of making a swap is what’s disgusting here. Do not lose sight of that. That’s the evil here, not the U.S. getting an unjustly prisoned person back for someone who was justly imprisoned.

Exactly. Every single person in an American prison for weed possession needs to be let out immediately and all charges scrubbed from their records so they can get jobs. This is fucking DISGUSTING.

Because it’s a fucked up and irrelevant point. It implies you think anyone that protests the U.S. deserves to rot in jail. I truly don’t get how you can’t see that, but I know you don’t.
I concur. But these fragile snowflake will ask you what keeps atheist from suppressing/torturing/beating other people if they don't have "moral compass". Some people won't learn because they don't want to learn.

Can there ever be more? I think at best we can push the boundary for what is an ultimate "value" and what is just instrumental, letting us derive the instrumental stuff from a more "pure" idea of values. But in the end there will always be a subjective basis.

1. giving up on morals/judgements/values imposed to you from your environment (parents/religion/society/...).
Reality is when these laws were made it wouldn’t have even been questioned why they were needed. That was just how it was and the conception of gender identity and what being trans means would have been far more simplistic and set in the ideas of a gender binary, which would have involved a trans person having already gone through as full a transition as medically possible at that time. And women can’t be allowed to have the equipment to biologically “father”(for lack of a better term) children.
That’s interesting. Since I assume that doesn’t mean Finnish people aren’t aware of the distinction between “sex” being the biological fact based (somewhat arbitrarily) on DNA and hormones and “gender” being the behavior/appearance/etc. independent of DNA, I’m curious how that distinction is expressed in Finnish. A lot of conversations I’ve had in English kind of break down when we use them interchangeably, so I assume there’s some kind of phrasing that makes it clear which one a Finnish speaker is referring to?
I'm not sure what you mean here - biological sex is the result of a sex chromosome in the egg (always X) and a sex chromosome in the sperm (X or Y), so the biological sex of the fetus is differentiated by the sperm produced by the man (and sperm, being constantly produced by men, could conceivably be dependent on external factors like war). Women do carry the fetus obviously, and at least one of the references indicate that stressed women have increased likelihood of miscarrying male fetuses, so is that what you're referring to? But as with all things, it seems to be more complicated than that and it seems no one has really looked at the mechanisms behind the "Returning Soldier Effect"; the papers listed are really just (minimal) statistics run on (relatively narrow) historical populations with some speculative "here's why" added.
No it isn't. After your death, your widow just lost half her household income, and now you want her to be a single mother? Are you shitting me? Nah, any intelligent woman is going to move on with her life.

1. Since, younger people are more likely to spread the virus, vaccinating them first would curb the spread of the virus, protecting the elderly. Also, younger people may be more likely to be able to access the vaccine quickly due to their ability to travel and stand in line for longer periods of time, which could help to speed up the overall vaccination process.

Okay? Your link still lists New Jersey as having a higher per capita death rate than DeSantis. But sure, I'll support passing the Governor of Death crown to Tate Reeves. The point was that the Governor of Death title is, to use your words "highly misleading". Florida, using your own link, is still 14th compared to New Jersey being 10th. Thanks for supporting the cause without even realizing it, though, I appreciate it.
"Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you're a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible.".
I wonder why these tax return disclosure laws never simply direct the tax agencies to directly release the returns of candidates to the public, either with just a standard set of redactions (including Social Security Number) or with standard redactions plus the option for the candidate to argue in some expedited court proceeding for specific further redactions for justifiable reasons - but not the option to prevent disclosure entirely.
It's a little more nuanced than that. The use of the court system by private parties to impose penalties/restrictions on other private parties still requires government action, because the courts are an arm of the government. So the 1st Amendment still applies in civil suits, though the manner in which it applies may be different depending on the circumstances.
Private civil actions are still subject to the 1st Amendment, because the use of the court system by private parties to impose penalties/restrictions on other private parties still requires government action (the courts are an arm of the government). For instance, if the government passed a law allowing churches to sue anyone who said anything negative about Christianity, that law would (or should, rather) be struck down as unconstitutional.

Exactly. If you lie and are told by a lawyer 'hey stop lying about my client' and you keep doing it publicly - you've still broken a law and aren't covered by 1A. Way too many people, esp on the right, seem to believe that freedom of speech means you can say whatever you want, wherever you want, whenever you want...
Ignoring that the article says this isn't even gonna happen (which we knew anyway), I assume they would have kept Son regardless given that Jesu Christ was an actual human male.

Jesus refers to God as 'the Father' multiple times in the Gospels. They were likely originally written in Greek and/or Aramaic. Though the Catholic Church does indeed teach that God is neither man or woman, cause he doesn't have a body. Fair enough. They still refer to him in masculine terms just to continue the 2000+ years tradition I guess.

Yes. PPP was supposed to be used to keep employees on the payroll. So were the massive corporate bailouts. Both groups fired employees anyway. There were no provisions for corporations to pay anything back. Oversight on PPP was trashed by trump and Mnuchin so they got those loans forgiven anyway. But God forbid we forgive $10k student loans for the struggling middle class.

What situation? He is super intelligent, dedicated to saving lives, sacrificed greatly for this country and he says he is happy to answer more of their questions because he has nothing to hide. Does he make GOP mocs look ridiculous and stupid? Sure, but that's only because they open their idiotic mouths.

Traditionally, media is collectively moderately critical and also values the sanctity of the federal government institutions and those in it. Often it was media that hold the president to the highest standard.

The "special counsel" is someone completely different -- much like Ken Starr, has the power to complete the investigation and bring charges outside of the normal processes of the Justice Department, so as to avoid the appearance of improper political interference into a criminal investigation.

Agreed. Garland’s punt to a special counsel after more than a year and half is total bullshit. Especially after the J6C publicly provided so much information. If he was going to punt why didn’t he do this at the 6 month mark?

"How far he has fallen?" How much was there to begin with, like, maybe 2 feet? Seriously, I get the point you are making, but this behavior is really no different from what he has been doing all along - deny what is obviously the easily verified the truth, to an audience that is so caught up in their cult of personality these lies actually work.

There weren’t any food shortages either. In fact, the little shop where is buy most of my groceries had better stuff than normal. Things like actual big bags of Doritos and some decent beer. (Chinese brands of beer are in big bottles but are kind of weak) I just got back to the states a little over a year ago, and just after I left, shit really hit the fan. I don’t know why it got so out of control, but it lasted so much longer. People in my city had to stay indoors with no going out for supplies even, for like 2 months. And there were food shortages and panic buying.

Russia is definitely prepping for a "stab in the back" narrative post war. Nice excuse to purge any "undesirables" too. "Oh we totally would've won but the unpatriotic stopped us from warring hard enough.".
He doesn't have any real power, as he can't even do anything against the (pro-Putin) Saint Petersburg mayor that's criticizing him for using an illegal mercenary army, is constantly being searched by Russia's security apparatus, and doesn't even get a meeting from Putin. Plain and simply, there's no evidence on the ground that Prigozhin is building up influence among Russian siloviki, military and policymakers.

I suspect his big value is that he gives off the appearance of "independence" from Putin, allows the latter to shift responsibility for breaking Russian law to subordinates like Prigozhin, and makes Putin seem "moderate" in comparison.

1. From previous articles I've read, Russia's bureaucracy is indeed monstrous. It's a remnant of the Soviet era that they just never really got rid of. The government also directly employs a lot of Russians, and a large percentage of Russians depend on the government for their livelihood. That's been one of the factors cited in why Russians have been hesitant to be critical of the Putin regime; not only do they fear being jailed, they also fear their families being cut off from their only source of income.
Turks have been living in Anatolia in large numbers since at least the 1100’s, and European Greece had been controlled by Turks for almost 400 years. I would be surprised if the Greeks and Turks aren’t genetically closer. 1000 years of close proximity usually deludes ethnic differences. I have no proof of this but I always thought of modern 20th/21st cen Greeks and Turks as just two cultures of the same people. (Granted I could never say this to ether of them. They’d probably call a truce just to kick my ass).
Climate change is too abstract and scientific for most people to see the causality chain from our own actions to death and suffering to get an immediate emotional response; digging up oil, driving around in an SUV, exploiting the environment for fun and profit is rather incentivized and not like going further than Hitler ever did by gassing the whole planet; also we aren't feeling helpless, we just don't feel like it; it requires long term investment and fundamental changes, we can't just throw money at it, feel good, and continue with business as usual.
That’s why this is all a charade. Homeland security has already done very thorough checks on this fool. Especially after the appointment to congressional committees. Why are the Democrats not asking this question. They know. Every member of our house and senate has to have some degree of security clearance. People this is NOT a fucking Wendy’s!
Considering the licensing process of approval and background check I had to get to sell insurance is disturbing compared to the vetting they do for politicians this is just disgusting if you’re a politician we want to see ALL your finances and tax returns PUBLICLY why should it be any other way they LIVE off tax payer dollars and get paid farrrrr too much already… shit it’s harder for me to continue my adderall perscription than it is to get elected into office OR get a gun in this country.

What do you expect? We have a rapist and a cult member for a Supreme Court justices, at least 19 members of Congress that were actively involved in an insurrection and a Speaker of the House that is beholden to Russia. They likely view fraud as a cute attempt to fit in.
TL;DR: Some of the first batch of prisoner volunteers actually survived their tours and, surprisingly, the Russian government actually followed through on their promise and pardoned them... And Russians weren't to thrilled about convicted criminals being turned loose onto their streets.

Civilian criminals become military criminals. More importantly, it goes against how a professionalized military fights - you have to be able to trust each level of the chain of command, from your teammates on up, in order to execute intricate combined-arms operations. It takes training, often years of it, and it takes a camaraderie that you simply cannot create by pulling people out of prison jumpsuits and shoving them into cammies.

Precisely. To make matters worse Russia also doesn’t waste med evac resources on them so if a prison recruit is injured they’re often left to die unless they can get themselves out.
"100%" figure on the graph doesn't actually translate to supporting literally every bill. In fact, I'm not sure how they calculate that 100%, but she voted to keep filibuster rules in place instead of protecting voting rights, to remove CDC guidelines on travel recommendations, abstained from voting to establish a Jan 6th investigation committee, and switched parties in order to keep the Senate split.
All good. That was more a function of the inversion in how voters approached mail-in ballots/what got counted when. If the 2018 election was held with 2020 attitudes towards absentee voting Sinema probably would have been consistently in the lead from election night onward, with each consecutive batch of late drop-offs getting tabulated shrinking the margin (but ultimately not being enough to change things).

What about Jill Stein? Are you all still blaming her for Hillary losing? If anyone is to blame it's the DNC. Move on and expect better from your own party.

look, just because I said he happens to be Black doesn't mean what the Radical Left thinks it means, all I was saying, you have Ye, Kanye, he's one of my Great African Americans, because I know a lot about what happened, and it's a real shame, but it had nothing to do with me, just so you understand, nothing to do with Trump. the Radical Left was probably there, I bet Nancy Pelosi, she would've had a lot if you know what I'm saying, but now you can't say it, because if you do the Fake News will start a Phony Witch Hunt, and then we'll be back at Square One. we came so far for 4 Years, we had, and when I say this I'm being 100% Honest, but we never had a better time than we did when I was in charge. no Taxes, no Deaths, we came a long way after Obama, but then Sleepy Joe and Crooked Hillary took us back to the Stone Age. we used to be, they said, "America is Number One," and now, we don't even know what Last Place is. ok, enjoy yourselves, have a nice time. you're welcome, by the way.
Now, for the outrage in trump and his nazis, well, he's using nazis to undermine so many vital efforts (at the national security and security of our species level) and to destroy US democracy and NATO so fascist russians can take more and more power, which benefits fascists everywhere.

He’s not under fire. Trump is given a platform by the media and the Republican Party. He’s the most powerful Republican in the country and everyone is still afraid to challenge him. Cowards.
Edit: note that this is “assets.” I’d guess only a small chunk of it is cash. Shares are likely a mix of publicly traded and closely held. Probably a good amount of precious metals mixed in, possibly other tangible assets not easily leveraged by CS. This is all speculation, of course, but would follow from typical portfolios of other large clients of other Swiss banks.
Mongolia? Statues? There are statues of confederates in America that doesn't automatically mean people look at them favorably. You're acting dense, I can tell..

Does that mean they are using that money to pay for infrastructure in Ukraine 🇺🇦 in the future I hope so I read they are stealing people and wheat grains and water from lakes wow not to mention all the killing and rockets damaging infrastructure putin is very wrong for attacking Ukraine 🇺🇦 God Bless Ukraine 🇺🇦.

Where's the flip flopping? How does Switzerland profit from... Not selling stuff? Do you think we're getting money from RU, even though we sanction them & freeze their assets? Which sides are paying us for what here?

It’s really quite simple, the pseudo “Christian” Religion in the US has extensively laid the groundwork for generations to train people to believe in authority figures with unverifiable stories instead of science and data. It also primes them for, and is built upon, perpetuating racism and fearmongering towards "others". Once people see you as an authority, you can start fabricating any reality or conspiracy theory you want your followers to believe and everyone else is therefore a liar, even in the face of incontrovertible evidence. Basically, it is mental abuse from an early age that suppresses critical thinking skills. This “religion” combined with an intentionally weakened public educational system, provides the framework that has spawned this cult of ignorance.

Interestingly one of NATOs responses to the use of a tactical nuke is to attack Belarusian military facilities (possibly with a tactical nuke).
I should point out that a) I said possibly a tactical nuke, this doesn't mean definitely, b) Russian nuclear doctrine says they will use nuclear weapons to defend Russia, so a NATO strike on Russia soil would give then cause to use nukes, NATO know this and are fully aware of the risks involve with actually attacking Russia and c) I said one of their responses. This doesn't mean it's the likely response or they still have that as a plan. There are properly 100's if not 1000's of possible responses they would of planned out. 99% of them we will never hear of.

What I can see occurring if Russia drops a tactical nuke in Ukraine as a final warning, is that no, the West would not retaliate militarily at least with nukes, virtually all of Russia's allies (except for North Korea) would condemn this suicidal move and distance themselves from Russia, especially China, who has already warned Russia to avoid nuclear escalation.
Here is another interesting resource: where you can see that, much like the wealth/property statistics today, the top 10% of families owned 84% of the slaves.
And according to , after adjusting for the slave population itself, 4.75% of the free population owned slaves. The article goes on to indict the family members of the people who actually owned slaves counting that 1/3 of southerners, pre-civil war, owned slaves. Maybe that's fair, but women and children couldn't own property nor could they vote, so to me, politically, it makes more sense to cut the pop number in half, bringing the percentage to 9.5% of the pre-civil war south owning slaves, which at least would include the male children, ie future property, ie slave, owners. And if you add the northern population of free and enslaved people, the number probably actually gets diluted on a per capita basis (edit: assuming there were any at that time, idk the exact numbers there).

These exist and are called mobile substations. They typically are used to take a substation out of service for maintenance. Getting 6 million people back on in 24 hours seems like transmission line repairs to me. It’s an insane amount of customers to get back on in that short of a timeframe.
Yes that's what Im asking, well aware that it's dead of winter and people have other needs for the electricity 🙄, nobody is questioning ur rights to live or prosper, it's just a basic concern of what if the Russians target again to drain out Ukrainian resources, because the news everywhere else is that the Russians are raining missiles over Ukrainian, is it like building a sandcastle near the sea over nd over and the sea just keeps wiping it out(just a figure of speech for Russians trying to drain out the resources),again super glad for the electricity being restored again.

Agreed. They are heroes. This shit is so tragic and needless. I've been crying for 10 months, all the way across the world, with no way to help except monetarily. I can't WAIT for Putin to die.

Unsurprisingly. As many volunteers as there are for their military, there's bound to be even more for the many civil and infrastructure projects necessary to keep up the war effort. With a well-motivated populace like this, the only bottlenecks become material and transportation, both of which appear to be helped by Ukraine's benefactors.

GILMAN LOUIE: One of the critical things for us to be successful in returning manufacturing, as well as many other technologies that are going to revolutionize the economy over the next decade, is to not just get alignment from the government and the research capacity of our great universities, but we've got to get our capital markets involved, right? I mean, if you look at the US as compared to a country like China, the Chinese are investing probably in the neighborhood of 10X what we're investing in these deep technology areas. And while they're $2 trillion of commitment over the next five years is a lot of money, we have $45 trillion in capital markets. And if we can direct the capital markets to start investing in these critical infrastructures like microelectronics, not only do we shore up our supply chain challenges that we have, but we also lay the foundation for the next generation of technology that we can create a trillion or more dollars of economic wealth.

Edit: I’ve looked into it a bit more. The initial reports that I saw suggested that it had been set up specifically for kids. However, the reports out now say that it was an adult torture center that had a cell specifically for kids where they were starved and abused. According to victims, it seems that the kids were mainly subjected to mental torture: telling them that their parents had abandoned them and forcing them to scrub the blood from the room where the actual torture took place.
Definitely. I think there’s a point where you’re aware of the scale of atrocities and being exposed to more stories of them does nothing to help at that point. It’s definitely still good for people who don’t believe what’s going on over there to read/see these accounts, and to never forget historically, but yeah. This stuff does take a toll mentally.

Absolutely insane. We need more boycotts and sanctions not just against Russia, but also against all its allies and trade partners. It's time to punish the big ones, India and China, who are feeding the Russian war machine with money, parts and supplies.

As soon as a Republican speaker is elected absolutely zero meaningful legislation will be passed and we’ll have 2 years of sham investigations into someone who’s never even been involved in politics and sham impeachment hearings.
I disagree. If Jeffries became Speaker, he'd be paraded on Fox News as the mascot of government inaction, while the Republicans to blame for it would get off scot free. Letting the House Republicans burn themselves out is a better play. Some might say "but the House can't do anything without a Speaker," but that's not the Democrats' problem to fix. The House GOP got the mandate, so only they get to clean up their own damn mess.

Seriously. Anyone saying the democrats shouldn't try to find a compromise have no idea what's going on. Every time Mccarthy loses, the supermagas get more and more of what they want. If dems can make a deal that hurts or removes the freedoms caucus, they should go for it.

This is so fucking funny. Imagine being a Qanon fuck who thinks Trump is the smartest human in all of existence and has a master plan. You've lost friends and family from your insane worship of this deranged grifter, but you've stayed strong with your Qultist bros on the message boards telling you that the next big thing is coming. That soon the globalists will be publicly hanged. Biden will be forcibly removed and Trump will return to office and solve all your problems. Trump announces a big thing is coming, "holy shit, it's actually happening" you're gonna get to shove it in the faces of all your doubters. And then he announces a fucking photoshop series of Trump EFT fan fiction superhero cards. For $99 a piece. Incredible.
I mean, the trump campaign steals the rights to shit all the time, turnabout is fair play. I'd say you'd need to edit them a bit, though. Maybe with some of his greatest hits quotes.

Exactly. I'm not from the US, but it seems so strange that the founding fathers are seen as some sort of legendary humans and leaders who did everything they could for the betterment of the country.
But sometime less than halfway between now and then, probably around mid spring, we will hit the debt ceiling. If Congress doesn’t act at that point, we go into basically a slow motion financial collapse. First the government starts pulling out of its investments, which immediately destabilizes the financial system. Soon you can’t redeem US Treasury bonds anymore, which means the banking system grinds to a halt. Meanwhile the value of the dollar craters and ships start staying in China. It’s not far from that to widespread famine and starvation, a straight up depression. That’s late spring. By the end of summer, it’s all over and literally nothing prevents a foreign power from just landing troops and taking over.

Theoretically, yes. If by some miracle six Republicans found their spine and decided that dealing with a Democrat speaker was preferable to kowtowing to extremists then it could happen.
3) If a disabled person genuinely cannot work at the deemed exchange rate for minimum wage, and they aren't super-happy at their current job...then maybe they should be doing something else with their time and paid a livable amount just to exist because they aren't capable of working (competitively)? Again, we're the richest country on Earth, people shouldn't have to work to support themselves if they can't or just don't want to.
2) We're the richest country on Earth. We should be able to pay everyone a living wage if they're giving our time to us through working, either through the employer's money or through subsidizing what the employer can give in order to produce a living wage for the disabled employee(s).

The language of the bill is both borderline graphic and incredibly vague: it defines the body parts that stores are prohibited from showing in books, live performances, and films with meticulous specificity, including “human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state” even if covered. It measures nudity as “the appearance of a human bare buttock, anus, anal cleft or cleavage, pubic area, male genitals, female genitals or vulva” and seminudity as “the appearance of the female breast below a horizontal line across the top of the areola at its highest point. Sex acts are defined as “fondling or erotic touching” and “normal or perverted, actual or simulated, including intercourse, oral copulation or sodomy.”.

This mentality is exactly why previously successful entrepreneurs are notoriously bad at investing. They spend the early parts of their career hearing “no” a lot, become successful through hard work and luck (and some of their own talent), and become utterly convinced that they know more than everyone else. If they have an contrarian idea, then it absolutely must be a genius-level thought, in their minds. To believe that they’re fallible would destroy the mythos they’ve created for themselves.
Its essentially safety theater but recycling theater lol. When I was a sophomore in Ap environmental studies we went to the recycling center and dump. That's when I learned how pointless it really seems/is. That was like 13 years ago now I think and we obviously often discussed climate change pollution and how we were gonna run out of time and I don't think things have improved much. Its weird growing up ppl constantly telling you the worlds in danger, rainforest are being destroyed then you grow up and those are issues as much as they were talked about, are never addressed and now things seem to be at that breaking point and I think most of us have just become numb. Whatever Happens for exactly the reason stated in a comment up top and even urs. Corporations and government who can actively make change anything have decided to ride the Bitch that is profit straight to hell instead.
Exactly. Climate change is barely a scratch for the earth. For us though? It’ll kill all of us but in 1000 years earth will be back to pre industrial era.

Yes. Not by the Russians hacking the voting machines or ballot stuffing or dead people voting or any of that crazy bullshit, but by coordinating with the Trump campaign to influence the outcome of the election in part through large-scale disinformation campaigns meant to sway voters in Trump's favor. There was no doubt cast on the legitimacy of Trump's win. The issue was the fact that an individual running for the highest office in America was actively working with a foreign government to win said office. Which if you're perfectly okay with a foreign dictator helping your president to get elected in order to further his own shitty dictator interests, then lack of the basic comprehension of facts is probably the least of your problems.

2. If he did it would be proven after Trump had his DoJ dig into this. You have a misunderstanding of how nepotism works and how it's hard to root out. Any Biden will have leverage by having that last name, nothing has to be offered. And unless there's some law that states that it's illegal to have that surname, you're out of luck, homie. You're imagining some lame Hollywood movie plot.

Without gerrymandering (legal how?) and the electoral college the parties wouldn't seem so evenly divided. One party consistently gets all the perks of corruption and that is all by design, we can now easily design better. Scotus has even been tainted due to partisan power lust, no branch of government is immune or clean. Thus they all need redone and reset, a whole new system would be the easiest way. Get rid of loose wording that let citizens united decision ever be a thing. Write in the new constitution our leaders can't build a world army for the rich to bully others off the backs of regular citizens. Man it could be really great, people just need to rally behind it. The mechanisms to do so are already there, we need but do it.

Neon gas is a critical input for the semiconductor industry due to its use in lasers. One of the largest sources of neon is the steel industry, where it is a byproduct of liquid oxygen generation. As of 2022, Ukraine supplies an estimated 50 percent of neon worldwide, which is largely attributable to the legacy of the Soviet steel industry. The U.S. semiconductor industry is dependent on this portion of the global value chain, as Ukraine produces nearly all of the ultra-high-purity semiconductor-grade neon imported by the United States. This executive briefing explains neon capture, its chief downstream application (i.e., lasers), and Ukraine’s importance in the neon supply chain.".

The protesting people in Javanrud have been attacked with war bullets by the repressive forces of the Islamic Republic, the hospitals of Javanrud and Piranshahr are facing a shortage of blood, and the forces of the Islamic Republic do not allow blood shipments to enter Javanrud, the Islamic Republic is carrying out a genocide in Kurdistan.
Well, in 1992 Democrats won the House, the Senate, and the White House, then in 1994 Republicans won the legislative branch and held onto it until George W. Bush outraged the American people enough to give Democrats another chance fourteen years later.

So if past is prologue Republicans will win the House and maybe the Senate in the midterms, lots of governors races and local state legislatures, they'll use their power to prevent Democrats from moving on their legislative agenda and roll back what progress they can where they can, they'll run sham investigations into potential Presidential candidates and hold open Supreme Court vacancies to tempt their voters, then in 2028 the United States will elect a batshit unqualified Republican President, and Democrats will get another chance at winning local elections and legislating as early as 2032, but possibly as late as 2036, assuming we're still having elections by then.
Frankly, nuclear weapons are shockingly easy to make. All you need is a large quantity of explosives, a kilogram of enriched Uranium 235, and time. After that its just n+1 until they figure it out on their own. And honestly, all a nuke is, is an explosion that acts to compress the radioactive element into a supercritical state, and since ww2 was done functionally by taking Uranium, putting it in an artillery tube and shooting it down the tube with explosives into another brick of Uranium. Worked quite well actually.

No idea. This was information that I read in an Economist article. They said that it was largely because people repurposing these chips were largely unqualified for the job and using the chips for purposes that they were not originally meant for.

Obviously, yes. But I think once the trail is revealed and public, something MUST be done about it, by companies themselves or the government.
The majority of US nukes are aboard the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, and the Minuteman locations are North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. And who cares? Those silos have been there for 60 years. .
Have you considered the 50 years of actual Cold War, the War on Terror, the fear of Italian "anarchists", the "insert period of ridiculous fear based antics", etc... where we wasted trillions of dollars, mentally scarred generations of children, arrested foreigners, invaded 3rd world nations and slaughtered people, and constantly overreacted to every possible balloon/ mail parcel/ satellite/ bottle containing more than 3 oz of liquid at an airport needlessly?

I get the point you are trying to make. However, the CIA’s skyhook is completely different than what’s goin on here. That was designed so a c-130 could catch a wire with a dude/object tied at the bottom. The balloon would disconnect once the wire was caught. Otherwise it’s going to hit the plane and/or get sucked into the propellers.

"Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization. I say your civilization, because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization, which is of course what this is all about. Evolution, Morpheus, evolution. Like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You've had your time. The future is \our\ world, Morpheus. The future is our time.".

I am tired of seeing the whataboutism on Ticketmaster. Breaking up monopolies is a different kind of important. Bringing out the antitrust laws is a step in the direction of holding corporations accountable for their predatory practices. And god knows we need to hold pretty much every corporation accountable. Record profits on account of record prices and stagnating wages is not the move. If Ticketmaster is the straw that broke the monopoly camel’s back, so be it! Someone said ticket sales weren’t in the Bill of Rights, and I agree, but life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness certainly were. Concerts are a part of the pursuit of happiness. The whole shtick of the United States is that you can come here and even on the common man’s salary you can do shit like go on vacation or gasp… see a concert. So, fuck Ticketmaster. May they be a gateway to breaking up many monopolies.

Most Indian reservations are near either: superfund sites, lithium deposits, mining deposits, or toxic waste dumping. A lot of that is because during the 20th century, there was a lot of industrial expansion west, and most of the Indian reservations in the US are west of the Mississippi. Since the reservations are already on some of the shittiest land available(and this is well documented as being very calculated), they were not considered worth prioritizing, along with the obvious racism.
Thank you. Your response is the only one that did a good job of starting to dissect the extra nuances going on. I think the biggest thing I'm trying to understand is the contrast between white rich people being brought up in a super site versus the Indian reservations being the other example. I think you started to dissect that as they are made super sites for different reasons or at least held to different standards? There's a bit of a Chasm between the first paragraph and the second final point that I was trying to understand.

Yep. Conservatives don’t care about freedom. They just want the freedom to be the worst, most vicious versions of themselves without criticism. They’ll hide their bigotry behind whatever they need to (states rights, religious freedom, personal freedom) but in the end, they’re just bad people who don’t want to be told they can’t be racists or homophobes. Your freedom means nothing to them.

Apple isn't censoring anything. You would still be able to hop on safari and navigate to Twitter. What they would be doing by removing them from the app store is removing the perception of association and the perception (real or not) of making money from Twitter. They are free to choose who they as a company associate with, and can take steps to remove perceptions of associations they don't want.
they're losing 500-600 soldiers a day in this conquest and they're struggling to take tens of meters a day, and they've barely reached the edge of the city. i don't think ukraine will pull their soldiers there until they're at risk of encirclement. that's when it'll fall, but they've only now started evacuating civilians this week, so i think there's a ways to go. urban combat is hard for the attacker.
Seriously. We were able to give them equipment with a shelf life and then pay the military industrial complex to make replacements for us. It’s a stimulus package for the US that also helps weaken Russia. Probably the biggest win of the Cold War since the 90s.

Ya obviously. That is why is said half sarcasm. Of course it’s great for Americans to be working and this is a valid reason but we as a nation have been complaining about the defense department being a bloated and corrupt wing of the government for half a century and you know that. This just happens to be the first win they’ve had in 80 years.

Corruption? Nazis? Looks like your swallowing those conservative talking points. Guess who else has corruption and Nazis? We do! And so does Russia. This isn't about Ukraine, this is about beating down Russia. Ukraine chose democracy in 2014 and has gone into the wests sphere of influence. Ignoring them now sends a message to the whole world, especially Europe, that the US is not your ally.

The main difference usually is that most (left) anarchists wish to abolish private property as to prevent as much unjust hierarchies from coming into existence as possible, while libertarians/ancaps think that private ownership must be preserved in a lawless society creating needless unjust hierarchies for power’s sake.

Since we’re talking about god like space magic a population-scaling self-replenishing self-sustaining energy resource and food/drink system for every planet hosting life could have ushered a period of universal peace and prosperity.

I mean, it's all pretty simple stuff. Stop introducing and passing policy that helps banks and corporations make more profit at the expense of the Middle class, and stop attacking anybody who disagrees with your political opinions racist, homophobic bigots. Tends to drive away would be converts. The right seems more accessible to many Americans right now because of the talk of fighting corruption(I am aware that talk is not backed by action, but often talk is all it takes to sway a vote). A lot of poor America is angry, rightly so. They're opportunities and the future of their children have been sold out from under them, and I hear a lot of rhetoric about tearing it down and starting over rather than fixing what is broken. If democrats want their votes, they have to accept a wider range of political views, and most critically, they must reconcile the anger that many of these people are feeling, by both validating it and offering constructive rather than destructive avenues for them to express it.

Right now other than the Constitution itself, with Dobbs in place you can pretty much ignore anything involving common law precedent, you can flex the 'states rights/control' argument in whichever way is opposite of established precedent, and that's just a layperson's examination of the situation.

The conservative justices that wrote Dobbs have absolutely no fucking clue what kind of legal hell on earth they've unleashed for themselves the way they decided Dobbs and weakened stare decisis because it gives more states and people the ability to give them the middle finger than they intended trying to write it narrowly for abortion and failed.

I'd love to see a legal expert's take on this, but the entire reason Dobbs made the news cycle earlier this year besides Abortion is because it makes an absolute mockery of, and rejects, judicial precedence.

There are reasons SCOTUS decisions overturning old court cases near-exclusively grant rights rather than restrict them, and Dobbs is a land mine about to demonstrate why that is in the next few years.

Let me add that people are getting fined just for putting a LIKE on anything that is perceived "unpatriotic". Teachers getting ratted out by pupils and parents, students getting ratted out by their fellow students, people getting disowned by their family for not supporting the "spetzoperaciya", it's Orwellian levels of dystopia. And that's before all the shell-shocked Wagnerites and amnestied murderers and rapists start coming back from the war (well, the minority that make it), in fact it's already happening, several criminal cases being reported, incidents involving demobbed soldiers. I talk to some of the many Russians who fled to my country, they are all the normal ones as far as I can see: IT people, English teachers, they don't see how they can ever go back to living there. Anything up to a million of Russia's intelligentsia gone, left the country, many of them for good, all of this seems very very bad for Russia.
We were anticipating autonomous Amazon drones delivering packages. We got remotely piloted drones dropping hand grenades.
Real world corporations are a legal framework to create jobs and a living. Anyone that compares that to the government and their mafias building buildings illegally that get people killed are just not being realistic. The companies that get away with it are linked to Erdogan's government, they aren't a regular construction company taking pride in their work as builders. If you go talk with a large swathe of builders you'll realize that most of them want to be proud of their work, and most are organized in corporations. They want good marketing, good reviews, and safety is part of that. Erdogan's party's mindset is to loot as much as possible from anyone that doesn't support their view of the world. These guys work hand in hand with ISIS and other jihadist groups. They're murderous savages looking to genocide Kurds and Armenians, and kill anyone who isn't Muslim enough. Don't compare small business with that. Big corporate greed like Dole and their coups are bad but never caused this much damage over this amount of time. Hundreds of deaths for greed vs thousands, millions for government cronyism and ideology.
Exactly! A major catastrophe happened, and if the politicians of the last 30 years had done their jobs, tens of thousands of lives could've been saved.

Fascinating. The Americans do something similar as well with their lobbying system, essentially allowing an avenue of legalised bribery. So, what you’re saying is that the Chinese system works by functioning above the table rather than under it, with corruption kept on check by officials looking to cover their asses by refusing the potentially career-ending requests.
It's such an obviously good PR move to say "The money that was given to us was stolen, we're giving it back to his victims, and by the way, our opponents are in the same boat and aren't returning a penny, please vote D and give us $5" that I'm kind of surprised I'm being asked to be spell it out so explicitly.
The right thing to do? The money was given fair and square based on current campaign finance laws. Look, I'm not saying the DNC should be taking money from crooks or that money in politics is a good thing, but it's unrealistic for the DNC to be holding themselves to some arbitrary standard that a) the GOP isn't even pretending to care about and b) has zero political advantage. The DNC isn't a religious organization; it's a political organization. The goal is to win elections and use that political power to effect positive changes. If you say this move will positively affect political goals, then fine I'll stand corrected. But if they're just giving it back for warm and fuzzy feelings, it's dumb.
"The DNC" didn't do that. Biden was already leading by that point, he had massive leads in upcoming states, and the other moderate candidates (Buttigieg and Klobuchar) had no support in upcoming states and no money left to keep running, so they dropped out. That isn't a conspiracy, that is how primaries work. As for why they didn't endorse Bernie over Biden (which let's be honest, is the real reason you are upset with it): well, maybe Bernie's staff shouldn't have endlessly bashed all the other candidates the entire time with purity tests, alienating the supporters of those candidates. He couldn't make any coalitions with anyone, because they pushed everyone away.

Zelensky was really unpopular before the invasion. His popularity soared after that, because he was now the figure benefiting from a Rally Around the Flag phenomena, but he wasn't exactly doing well as President beforehand.
The ballot harvest thing is really messed up. I had my fire department visit my home and my wife answered. They pressured her to vote on increasing the fire department taxes. Like, sure... they didn't explicitly say they wanted us to vote that way but you know they want us to. And you just feel like you want to make them happy.
Here they thought limiting early voting, mail voting and "harvesting" was their best option, regardless of the consequences for anyone else or the country itself, but that didn't work so now they're scrambling to undo it all because it was only ever about manipulating the election result.

They have no deeply held beliefs or strong opinions about anything, only opportunistic lying, so it's trivial to do a complete 180 and go the other direction because everything they previously said about early voting, mail voting and "harvesting" was a lie.

No. There are many states that either restrict who is allowed to hand them in or limit the amount a single person can hand in. Ballot harvesting implies a large effort to collect countless ballots.

The margin was actually only 13% opposed to resignation, which I suspect is a combination of blind party loyalty (his seat really does matter to the republican bottom line, which is why the leadership hasn’t turned against him), him still conning some people as a flawed sympathetic figure, some people probably liking that he plays dirty and isn’t afraid to lie, like a Trumpian thing…and some good old fashioned cognitive dissonance—when painful reality contradicts comforting belief, people can and do just choose to ignore reality, and will instead believe in whatever made up versions of reality support their beliefs. The point isn’t what exactly they’re thinking, it’s that they will arbitrarily just change their belief system to prevent it from collapsing, to the point of becoming detached from reality, rather than just being able to accept that they were a fool. We’ve seen it once or twice. Part of me is surprised it’s not higher than 13%, but this guy is pathological. He’s absolutely buried in his own lies and the poll found that the margins are fairly extreme now.
Because she is a “good woman”. I grew up fundamentalist Christian so these dynamics hit home (I am a woman). Women who follow the role are rewarded. If they are pretty, faithful, always positive, have children, don’t question they are doted upon as being wonderful. Women who question, speak out against abuse (especially by men in high roles) are quickly punished socially by the group. Seen as bad, difficult, “crazy”, abusive, of Satan. “Everyone else doesn’t have a problem, why can’t you get along?” These institutions thrive on perception, women are groomed (and abused) to be good. Many have Stockholm syndrome in my opinion. It is really bad but people see it from the outside as the pretty facade that the group wants others to see. And Kate obviously is struggling with an eating disorder (similar to many women in the church with dealing with lack of control in their lives). Princess Diana also talked about hers she struggled with due to what she dealt with.
Exactly. Harry is the most normal of the rotten bunch and I applaud him for exiting that shitshow. I love it when they whine “but the queen sacrificed everything for decades to serve the people.” What? She got rich and used her money to protect a pedo prince.
Feeding children should be such an easy bipartisan issue. It's not that expensive and it's literally putting food into the mouths of children. Children who have no control over whether or not their parents can feed them. We waste so much money on inefficient solutions to things, but the infrastructure already exists for free lunch. Would be a slam dunk everywhere.
My sister was a lunch lady in a school where it was likely higher than 2/3 that needed subsidized lunch but because of the paperwork that ESL parents would have to fill out, many students still went without…my sister got an earful more than once for handing out lunches that weren’t accounted for in paperwork. I think this measure makes sense as it will do away with the need for red tape.

And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. – Bible : Genesis (19) : 33 – 36.

AFAIK: Do nothing about crime, do nothing about corruption, give the military a bunch of in country "duties" it shouldn't have and involve it in politics, use public money for pet infrastructure projects that are more ego boosting than useful, lead vague pro government rallies even though you're in government, and take de facto bribes from the US to keep migrants in Mexico.

he spends most of his time fighting the political opposition, complaining about the elites using their power to oppose him and blaming them for all things wrong (even though he's the most powerful and in control figure in decades), managing the backlash of all the stupid things he says/does and all the negative results (mainly by, somehow, blaming the elites and past governments as already mentioned ( just mentioning they were even worse if all else fails)) and directing a couple of state megaprojects, which again only generate backlash because they are stupid projects and they get negative results.
I've had a different experience with my conservative relatives. None of them had any idea about 666 Park Ave or Ivanka's Chinese trademarks or that the ACORN "sting" was a fraudulent hit job, or the Planned Parenthood video was spliced together. When you only get information from sources that present one side, you don't know these things. Fox just didn't cover Jan 6 the way real news did. Sure, they could find more balanced news, but honestly, they don't know how. The world has past them by in ways they don't understand, and they get mad about it because Tucker tells them to be. It's sad, really.
It was also exactly the kind of setup women are always accused of engaging in whenever a rightwing figure (like Kavanaugh) gets accused of inappropriate behavior, except that I believe that was projection for behavior the right is all too willing to engage in. Franken had proven himself to be a threat to Trump and company, so they found a way to ruin him. Did the left play right into their hands? Sure. The timing made that a political necessity, not to mention that Gillibrand also stood to benefit personally from eliminating him.
Who the fuck is choosing candidates without even a cursory verification of their credentials? Shit wouldn't have worked at starbucks but sitting congressmen, no problem. This country is such a joke.

The résumé Mr. Santos handed over was impressive, particularly for a political neophyte. He claimed to have graduated in the top 1 percent of his class at Baruch College, earned an M.B.A. at New York University and more than doubled revenue as a project manager at Goldman Sachs, according to a copy of the two-page document obtained by The New York Times.

Common misconception. Einstein was HIS assistant, but Santos is so humble he let ol' Albert take all the credit. Santos also came up with E = MC² and gave it to Albert.

Okay well for thousands of years Israel has been the center of war and conflict. Jews, Christians, and Muslims have all played their part. You might want to read more.
The failure of police to respond to the basic needs of Arab residents of mixed cities creates a "deep feeling of deprivation and alienation from the city" and their inability to respond during the riots deepened these feelings, leading them to "seek to take the law into their hands.".

This is about the israeli arabs and not those with Palestinian documents hence why the name "civil war" you can make the argument the arabs in Israel are treated like blacks in the US (worst than the rest of the population and prone to police violence) but they do have the same rights like the white- black situation in America (at least on paper).

Geez please. They have been on the brink of that for many decades. They refuse to make peace. I've heard this crap since I was a little kid. And I'm 65 years old.

The Abraham Initiatives stressed that the situation of Arab residents in mixed cities is "immeasurably worse" than the situation of Jewish residents, adding that this may explain part of the causes of the severe tensions that erupted in the riots in May 2021. The NGO emphasized that national tension and the feeling of alienation of Arab citizens from the state may also be a factor in the tensions.
Same thing with road fatalities: Roads were for everyone but after mass protest about all the child deaths at the wheels of the new automobiles tearing through them with no warning, mass campaigns paid for by Ford, etc., accusing people of "jay-walking" (jay being another term for hick or hillbilly) eventually became codified in law. Again, deflecting blame from the companies that make dangerous things and onto the individual for the state of the commons.
Scientific literacy? She's just the loudest voice telling people to look directly at reports and science. Hell, you can read oil companies own reports from over 50 years ago, detailing the effects climate change will have due to their practices. They've literally spent the last half century making this a political issue so there will be "2 sides", whereas in the 80s and 90s it was just discussed as a thing that is happening because of industrialization. One of the main themes in the Dune books was the negative effects from human intervention on climate, the first one was published in 1964.
I think the cigarette culture will die much sooner there as more and more stores will stop carrying cigarettes due to not enough demand, although it might take many decades to reach that point.
Exactly. You can get a large chunk of arguments here and just swap "cigarette" with "marijuana", and suddenly 90% of this thread will sound like a hardcore anti-weed American Republican politician.

Exactly. People on this thread seem to have a very narrow and exceptionally naive view of addiction and make the mistake of equating the power of the experience to the addictiveness of a substance. Which is not the case when it comes to nicotine. There are people even claiming that illegal cigarettes won't be smuggled into NZ because it's an island nation and they are getting dozens of upvotes. It's actually mad how foolish people are to how the world actually works.

Age discrimination. In addition, it's insulting to the people who are treated as if they aren't capable to make informed, enlightened decisions after extensive deliberation.
Definitely more battle hardened than the American, just less well equipped and networked. The last time the US fought a peer threat was WWII. Experience in counterinsurgency simply doesn't translate. Two armies in the world have now fought a land war in Europe in the lifetime of their leadership, and nobody else will ever match that experience, I hope.
The economic policies encouraged were completely catastrophic there. under History for a quick overview. Life expectancy dropped significantly, and there was a horrific public health crisis. Some of this was attributable to the natural consequence of a state dissolving as it did, but part of the economic doctrine anyway was not to have any direct intervention and just let the markets sort it out.

Yup. This is probably one of the best investments of the century. Take out most of the Russian Army, using mostly old military equipment that was going to be scrapped anyway, showing the incompetence of the Russian military in the process as nothing more than a paper Bear, with no NATO losses, building up several strategic allies in the process for the next generation or two, scoring massive military contracts for US equipment while getting countries off their Russian hardware, getting the West off Russian oil, and scaring the living daylights out of the Chinese not to try Taiwan too.

They are free. The US government purchases the aid with US taxes and sends them to Ukraine. The donors in this scenario are the American people. Though I'd argue that that isn't strictly accurate. The Americans are purchasing something, that something being Russia's defeat.
Russia is a good example, at least when it comes to the whole fear of failure ++ corruption. It appears one of the major reasons their military is in the state it's in && they couldn't achieve their stated aims is because of decades of theft at every level by leaders and those same leaders not wanting to tell Putin the truth for fear of falling out of a window while dying of radiation poisoning.
Yeah. Historians have reviewed the pre-war societies and concluded they were basically haemorrhaging money and manpower hand over fist. Many of their governments were full of infighting, competing and redundant organisations in an attempt to seize more power.

Not necessarily. It’s about brain-washing the young. To the old, their political party is a tool for enrichment that they don’t necessarily believe in strongly.

Its theoretically possible. It would require a dictator who was very competent at just about everything though, as in fascism one of the core points is you can't allow anyone else to get to powerful to contest you. Its very difficult to rule any area of any reasonable size without some element of clear power sharing.
Living in a relatively rich area, the rich still throw away stuff.. because they cant be bothered to donate or recycle them... to be fair, half my furniture is from stuff theyve thrown out so it kind of gets donated.
Absolutely this. If you give someone $10 for food, letting them spend $10 on sushi vs. $10 on 10 packs of ramen isn't going to change the fact that you gave them $10. Sure, you should give education about what foods are healthy, how to make funds last, etc., but strictly forbidding food items is pretty much a nanny state at that point.

Prosperity gospel. While christianity has had plenty kf bad takes through the centuries, this one is probably the craziest. Jesus spoke more abput money than any other topic. And every statement was that money and greed is basically bad. You have to twist basically the entire gospels to make hoarding wealth into a good thing.

...I remember the thing that caught my attention, the whole FFFFF thing... which was reported to be a vulgar acronym. It's not like I was offended at the vulgarity of it or whatever, but when he was asked about it they only brought up the one example (in the yearbook I think, "FFFFFFourth of July" etc) where it was so clear he made up the bullshit story about how it wasn't an acronym, it was some friend who had a speech impediment or something and said "Fuck" funny, stressing the F for far too long so it became an inside joke to stress the F in words that start with F... which could be twisted to make some sort of sense in the context of that one particular time it was used and asked about. But it wasn't the only time he used it, and in another context (a letter I believe) his story made no sense as he did use it like an acronym. My memory is a little hazy but at the time I vividly remember being surprised no one there caught this detail and pressed him on it.
Exactly. And this was being talked about long before the primaries. The possibility of 3 SC nominations. And even the possibility of Roe v Wade being overturned if a Republican got elected. Everyone should have been RUNNING for the polls to vote dem in that election no matter who the candidate was or how butthurt you were. I hope we all learned a lesson here...
During the Cold War, the concept of the First World (NATO, Japan, and their allies) and the Second World (the Soviet Union, much of Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, much of Southeast Asia, North Korea, Ethiopia, and others at various different times) emerged. The Third World comprised non-aligned countries (most of South Asia, Latin America, Africa as well as Sweden, Finland, Ireland, and other neutral countries). The term Third World today has evolved to refer to poor countries, as much of the Third World was underdeveloped, though there were poor and rich countries in every World. Today, we have Russia and China each attempting to build the foundation of their own blocs. They flirt with each other, but each imagines it will dominate the other in an opposition bloc. The real situation is Russia is a proverbial island with Belarus, and the same is true with China and North Korea. It hardly compares to the huge blocs that existed during the Cold War and is certainly not a unified front or clearly divided blocs. Acknowledging that China and Russia are clearly making moves to build their own blocs and suggesting that we try to avoid that is certainly not tantamount to "suggesting a new Cold War.".
If you think that "territorial annexation" is the primary or sole problem in the Ukraine war, in exclusion of, say, starting a potentially years-long war, killing civilians, destroying cropland and livelihoods, torture, displacement, all under the pretense of "liberation," while trying to take effective control of a foreign nation's political, military and economic resources, then I guess "annexation" is a big deal here. It just seems kind of disingenuous. It's like we are supposed to zone in on the one detail where American action isn't the same as what Russia is doing in Ukraine, despite countless other similarities, for most of which the US has ultimately done worse than Russia has to date.

Absolutely, dude. You opposed funding the German military at the NATO- minimum 2% of GDP your entire life, resulting in a sad, under-prepared for-show military. Now you’re playing catch-up, and will have to invest heavily for 10 years while your economy tanks and inflation and currency rates make those US weapons systems eye-wateringly expensive.
Serbia is currently under sanctions by OPEC, I work for an aircraft fueling company and we cannot sell fuel to any entity in Serbia or Russia due to those sanctions. I am unsure they have requested to join NATO though.
Exactly. They don’t understand the repercussions on any decision Serbia makes. Economy situation is already shit in the balkans now you want to take their heat from them?

Historically Russia always supported Serbia. There was a pan-slavism movement back in 19th century and Serbians were prominent supporters of it, which benefited Russia.

Austrian intelligence was largely cut off from Western cooperation because they are widely considered to be compromised by Russian intelligence.

Not exactly true. Russians and Serbians have similar mentality. Russia was creating a big empire, Serbia was creating a small empire, both pretending to unify neighbor Slavic nations into one.
No it isn't, it is simple supply and demand. If there is an oversupply of workers, they band together and only offer to provide their labor on specific terms more favorable to them. Constrain supply of a resource to increase its value. Employers are free to reject these terms the same way a worker can reject a job with low wages and poor benefits. If you oppose this, you oppose capitalism. When unemployment is high and there are fewer jobs than workers, employers are free to dictate employment terms more favorable to them. If you object to unions, then you must necessarily oppose the ability of employers to negotiate with workers in their own favor. It's the same thing: leveraging the limited supply of a resource you control to get more in exchange for it. You have to let everyone enter into contracts freely. Right-to-work laws don't do that.
Honestly either are good, I prefer Arcata as it's a single location and Bob (owner and main employee) is one of the nicest people I've ever met, he can recognise names and always has a smile on his face whenever he sees repeat customers, he even recognized me after 2 years. also their shreded peperoni is slightly better than Capri imo.
I'm currently thinking Jeffries might actually end up as speaker. Given how idiotic the anti-McCarthy fascists are, I can legit see a vote where enough of them agree to vote 'present' simply to spite McCarthy but they miscalculate/miscommunicate in a way that Jeffries gets it.
I'm currently dreaming of a vote where the Freedumbers all vote 'present' to spite McCarthy and don't realize they are putting Jeffries in as Speaker by doing so.

I'm actually starting to hope that the Freedumb fascists unintentionally put Jeffries in by having enough of them vote 'present' and fucking up their count in one of these votes. They clearly aren't voting for anyone at this point. There is lterally nobody else that can win the position right now besides Jeffries. All it will take is some angry asshat electoral math fuckup. I'm pretty sure that scenario isn't outside the realm of possibility at this point.

Honestly this is beyond just Putin, beyond just his cronies, this is a deeply entrenched cultural problem. Everyone lies about everything, it was a survival skill in the USSR, and it continues. You have to somehow make people care enough to put in and make that change and find people to run the place that actually do care to make changes. You can't just put Russia in time out and expect the behavior to change, like tbh I think the only thing that will solve a major problem like that is doing what the Allies did to Germans at the end of WW2 - make them clean up the mess their leaders created and that they've ignored by just pretending everything is fine because they don't care. Until people can be assured that they're not going to be shipped off to a gulag, they can't and won't care, and that is unfortunately a process that's hard and ugly.
Interesting. Yes, it is common for a waiter to take your card when you are paying at a restaurant in America. I always love hearing about the little differences in life between different countries. 😌 Thank you for sharing that.
This is purely anecdotal, but I came down with C Diff about 9 years ago after a brief hospital stay and when it turned out to be antibiotic resistant, fecal transplant was the next approved treatment option. Long story short, not only did the fecal transplant get rid of the C Diff, it effectively got rid of my Crohn's symptoms for like six months to a year. I felt like a completely different person.

Ok phew. Wasn’t trying to offend anyone with health issues. I just feel our bodies are more equipped to support our gut health but our cleanliness works against us. Animal behaviours could give evolutionary clues. I’m grateful humans have ways of transferring fecal matter that aren’t as gross. Thanks OP.

That research was like 2 small low quality case reports that received an onslaught of pop sci media and reddit fanfare, but the follow up randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate any benefit superior to placebo.
I would be for it but not for free use purpose under ukrainian command. Fire allowance by the provider only for military targets and only when they serve a preemptive purpose that helps preventing damage on ukrainian soil. Like striking airfields with bombers or choppers highly likely designated to target Ukraine, or tank columns and storages for material likely designated for shipping to Ukraine, or sevastopol Harbour, Kerch bridge and so on. Attacking power infrastructure on russian soil for example should be banned as that can fuel the russian propaganda that the west attacks russian civilians via ukraine operations for example and that is a narrative that can easily spin out of control in terms of russia aggression and their calls to retaliate against the west or even start using tactical nukes in Ukraine all the sudden.
It takes a long time to train crew and set these things up. They are very complicated. And the Iranian drones were unforeseen. They're also asymmetric because of the vast difference in costs between them and a missile with effective range needed to create a layered anti-air system. Only short range AA systems can be cost effective but since the drones can appear anywhere and are simply used on infrastructure if no military targets are around they need lots of such AA so they aren't really as cost effective. Particularly because they can always just be swarmed and overwhelmed. Might just be more effective to rebuild infrastructure later. There might not be answer that is reasonable, other than giving Ukraine even better offensive weapons to try to bring the war to a close sooner.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

All of the things that you might consider "conservative" or responsible - balanced budgets, healthier and safer communities, live-and-let-live approach, conservation of natural resources - are direct results of today's progressive policies. Which makes it funny, you start to wonder how long we've been lied to about what "conservative" and "liberal" even mean.

Before 2020 a lot of people in Belarus considered him somewhat independent and pro-western. But he turned out just another mindless pawn of his boss and Russia. Rest in piss.
And then there’s always a slew of responses that try to take it a step further to make the murder seem more ridiculous, each one thinking they’re extraordinarily clever, when I’m reality those are even more cringey than the original joke, mainly because they’re just riding the coattails of the original commenter.

I read it. Gave me the impression of someone who was in favor of working closer with the West over Russia but quickly sided with the dictatorship when protests broke out. Also got the impression from his reassurance shortly after the war broke out that Belarus wouldn't be used to invaded Ukraine (proven wrong after he was probably overruled or kept out of the know) and his desire for Ukraine to quickly come to terms with Russia that he was likely not in favor of the war expanding/Belarus being pulled into Russia's mess. Just making assumptions on the internet, though, so take it for what it's worth.
How much did they pay for those containers? A market price or more? Who sold them? What is going to happen to them now? Are they being sold for a market price or less? Who is getting them.
Why do the Republicans always seek to excuse the harmful actions of corporations and yet insist on calling them "people" and why do their economic polices always benefit most the greediest of the wealthiest minority, to the substantial detriment of the majority employee class? Oh, ... yeah. The greediest of the wealthiest -- persons and corporations -- are the actual owners of the Republican Party; they just stroke the emotions of the zealots who have contempt if not outright hatred of others not like themselves for votes -- emotions blind that follower class from seeing beyond the three or four word (slogans the cult of "45" Republican policy use to "sell" their brand) or they're just too lazy or too busy hating or telling others how to live to actually take the time to examine the actual facts of Democrat vs. Republican policy.
I didn’t study much honestly. I was a B/C student. Mostly during high school season I lived with two of my wrestling partners at one of their houses. They lived a couple blocks from school. So from Sophomore year on I gave his parents money for food (not a ton of food because we wrestled and had to make weight). I slept on an air mattress or the futon on his room.
The real solution is to adapt business needs to people so that people can get their needs met too - whether that's allowing people to flex time so that they can exercise in the evening, or whether it's businesses encouraging people to take a walk during down times during the day, the real problem is that there's just less daylight to go around.

2. "will force many children to walk to school in darkness" This obviously depends on latitude, but where I live kids walk to school in the dark all winter no matter what. The question is whether they also have to walk home in the dark.
There's no way the western equipment ends the war. It might lead to a scenario where they can starve southern Ukraine and Crimea of resources if they can cut a swath to the sea and bomb the bridge connecting Crimea and Russia (say with F-16s), but the Donbas is going to continue to be a massive slog for both sides.
Yes. We invaded Mexico after Americans crossed the us-Mexico border illegally, fomented a revolt in a Mexican border state, declared independence and then when the Mexican army came to put down the revolt, the white revolutionaries called on the us to invade Mexico to protect them which the us then did. Sound familiar?

OH NO Would you look at that Russia started a war special military operation with Ukraine a year ago, has been asking Belarus to help, then a year in when the Russians aren't doing well the "Ukrainians" wisely mount an unprovoked attack on Belarus for what I'm sure are good and believable reasons thus causing Belarus to have to enter the war special military operation aiding Russia!

Absolutely but what were the choices for progressive President? If I remember correctly it was either corrupt centrist as you say or the Ultra conspiracy Cheeto lord. I'm honestly not sure progressive Americans had a choice to be honest. What's the candidate you had in mind?
counterpoint: legality and regulation leads to safe avenues and sources (leading to less death by tainted product, infections from used needles, overdoses), pulls in tax money (that can be used to help pay for educational and medical programs with likely enough left over to feed into education or healthcare), less crime (less people selling), and overall less usage (less mystery, less lure of the taboo, less interaction with slippery slope elements such as dealers).

For a lot of people, some of these rules would really help them out even more than the free 10K-20K and would stop the money bleed that has been happening exponentially to students. I remember marching at UCLA because our registrations went from 1K to 2K a quarter in the 90s. My niece is going to college and it costs her 15K a quarter. This predatory lending to young people is not right. It might not be the perfect solution or "fair" to people who worked hard to pay their debt off or chose careers that were in demand instead of following their passion or chose to go to community college or chose a college in-state, made other sacrifices, but something needs to be done and at least this helps the working and middle class instead of all the money that goes to the rich like PPP loans and tax cuts for the rich.
Dude. I start at a new job on Wednesday. I’ve been out of work for a few years. Now when I start working, my student loan payments will start up again at around $700 per month. Between that and the cost of health insurance, there goes pretty much my entire pay.
Hanging people is awful no matter what, but the drop method has been used for centuries! Iran definitely could use if if they’re so hellbent on hanging protesters. But they choose to use a more barbaric and painful method on purpose. It just makes my blood boil.
Serious human rights violations. I'd like to see my country (US) and others step up to "encourage" decent behavior towards the protestors. I'll call my senators and representatives today. All the best to the people of Iran.

Horrific. There is a deep difference between killing protestors in the streets or in detention by police and the death penalty issued by the state. While the first one can be blamed on brutality of police and corruption of their morals, the second clearly states the intent of the state, a sanctioned policy. It destroys a lot more institutions that could have stopped it, obviously like the court system.

Regardless, Gerrymandering is an absolutely un-Democratic, horribly corrosive tool to systematically subvert elections and the will of the people. Two wrongs do NOT make a right.

"A panel of three judges on a district court conducted four days of hearings and held that although the new state Senate map may “disproportionately affect minority voters” in Tarrant County, and although the legislature may have given “pretextual reasons” for its redistricting decisions, the challengers could point to no evidence indicating that the legislature’s “true intent was racial.”".

I then moved to Austin for college. Stayed in that liberal oasis for all but five years of the rest of my life, I'm an oldster and retired early three years ago.

I think Republicans are going to keep doing pretty well when they can join with the most corrupt Democrats in doing everything from raising my taxes (Manchin) to outlawing abortion (Crueller) and still get called "moderate".
Maybe Democratic primary voters will eventually wake up and realize these so called "moderates" are actually the most extreme members of the party. Until then I guess the country will continue to pretend the Republican party is a center right party and the more one sides with them the more "in the middle" that person is. Which I think is guaranteed to result in Republicans having some control over the government for a very long time.

California Governor Gavin Newsom hasn't managed California well. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger very easily brushed off any recall nonsense. Most Californians would prefer Jerry Brown was still the Governor. Newsom simply road Brown's coattails.

When I was 16, I was pretty much an idiot who thought he knew the whole thing, beginning to end, smartest kid in the room anywhere. That kid would have totally agree with this decision, and embraced it, and engaged in the whole process.
The most important consideration, I think, in designing a power structure (including voter inclusion/suffrage) is to prevent excessive concentration of power rather than pursue real or imagined superior decision making capacity. Taking history, the state of the world outside of our reasonably functional democracies, and human nature (especially as it pertains to those who seek and behave with power) into account, extreme concentration of power leads to policies that benefit a select few which may be far harder to correct than poor planning potentially caused by a relatively ignorant collective power. Based on this as well as the potential for 16 and 17 year olds to pay a significant amount of taxes without representation, I think lowering the age to 16 is sensible.
The questions I pose are to highlight how unnecessary those concerns are. So, here's some answers. They're reconnaissance balloons. Variations of them have been used since WWI. It's cheaper and easier than using satellites, and they can be directed easily or stay in place for a period of time, whereas satellites have a narrow effective window as they constantly circle the globe and the cost of changing their trajectory is high, given the limited fuel. Geosynchronous orbits are too far away for spy satellites, and even if there was some crazy amazing camera where they could still be useful, it's still stuck looking at the same thing forever, which is great for communications but awful for general reconnaissance at that cost.
Exactly. The US military spent a ton of time and resources recovering the spy balloon debris from the ocean. Doubt they did all that just to see how good China’s cameras are. The assumption is this balloon had more capabilities than just photos.

Exactly. What we do know is if the pentagon assessed these balloons to be a serious threat, they would have no problem shooting them down before they got close to anything sensitive. Now that they have one in their possession, they can more easily determine the purpose and determine if they actually do pose a threat.
this proactive crossing the center straight line activity happens soooo many times regularly or even daily basis, I think the majority of Chinese and Taiwanese people are really immune to it, unless something much more severe happens like actions when Pelosi landed, compared to westurn audiences who are not exposed to these news much, who think this is a very big deal and war signal.
Lol. If the west didn’t “allow” China in, the west would’ve suffered economically and China would’ve formed their own trade bloc. But sure, make it sound like an act of charity from the west. The KMT were mainly supported for fighting Japanese and communists, which you strangely left out. The US even supported Apartheid South Africa in fighting communism when it threatened to spread to Southern Africa. Ideology, repressive regimes ,tyrants….it all didn’t matter as long as your enemy was their enemy.

Seriously. COVID is tearing their country apart. There's discord in the country. Economy is started to get much worse. People had started to rebel and had a slight uprising. This leads to decreased morale from citizens and inefficient soldiers. Threats won't work, beatings won't work, their social credit system is leading to inequality within the middle class and their employment rates are tanked. What you see from their media is obviously not what is happening there. Poverty stricken areas are only going to get worse. Like Russia. All bark, no bite.
Sigh... Oprah, like Obama is ulimatily a conservative. Both are very well spoken and everything, but still conservatives. In the old days I would have thought of them as liberal Republicans., which used to be a thing. Until they all changed after Carter, and Democratics became the party of right leaning conservatives I hardly recognize led by Bill. Everyone seems to think that the difference between being a liberal and a conservative has to do with whether you support Woe vs Wade or the Christian right. It is really all about whether you support economic policies that leave no one behind or you don't. Oprah is filty rich and supports very conservative economics policies and conservative personalities who think and travel in the same circle as her. This doesn't make her a bad person just not very economically intelligent, unless it is about how to make more money, which is easy when you're rich. There is an entire huge industry in America devoted to advisers who will tell you that it takes money, to make money and how to stay rich. Ask Oprah she owns eight homes.
I'm neurodivergent and naturally my executive functioning is a total joke as a facet of my condition, but I don't feel so bad about that anymore after seeing some of the most politically powerful and influential people of recent years.

It's the framing. There's an air of condescension to how Ray addresses her audience, and that's what Bourdain seems to be addressing here. It's why I never liked her when my mom watched her.

Absolutely. In the face of a strong jobs market and a receding pandemic the banks are screaming recession and inflation, allowing corporations to increase their prices over and over while blame gets laid elsewhere. The only actual result being that the rich get richer while bilking the middle class and the poor. As is tradition. And laying the fix for all of it on the Fed only fucks over the middle class even more with rate hikes, when we know the actual answer is properly taxing the rich.

And Putin looks only at the paper and gives money for creating batallions that don't exist. This all smells like corruption like the first day. All that destruction of foreign weapon systems is being rewarded too, if it really happened is another question. You hit a BMT or something similar? Wow you just destroyed a M270 MLRS, here have your 50000 rubles.
I never understood people who doubted Ukraines numbers; there’s no point to them lying about it because the truth is in their favour, it’s their weapon to enable the western world to support them, if anything I believe their numbers are conservative bias because at some point some idiot would say “look how easily they are making the kills they don’t need help” when you see a thousand deaths a day any western country in a similar situation (an offensive action) says “that’s too many we need to stop” and then project that behaviour on to Russia and assume they will stop but they won’t because they don’t care about their people, like most dictatorships.

I don’t know about that. This SP has teeth, he’s allowed to pursue all leads, investigate, and charge offenders, (that’s a critical distinction), unlike the Mueller investigation, which was extremely narrow in scope, and avoided mission creep, and could not even look at finances.

Russian air defence is actually one of the things they have that's working. Both Russia and Ukraine are using mostly the same air defence systems. The result is very little air activity overall by big stuff like planes and a bigger focus on small systems that the air defence wasn't designed to counter (because drones weren't really the same thing back in the late Cold War era).
Yes. Japan bad And Ukraine also bad Smaller countries living next to much bigger would-be empires which do not at all have awful histories as expansionistic powers are the real enemy Canada planning invasion of America Ireland planning invasion of Britain Portugal planning invasion of Spain The bigger countries only have ever been kind and benevolent, it is the malicious smaller neighbours who are the real problem! And it has most definitely always been this way.

Unironically: the biggest saving grace for the West will probably prove to be Obama's pivot to Asia, the US decision to engage in declassification of content to allies (one of the decisions which led to the pre-war warning to Ukraine), and the USMC / Army preparing so rigorously for island hopping warfare by working to innovate their tactics and platforms before they have to do so in the heat of a hellish war in the Pacific.

Except The Sensational story here is that Nestle's isn't at fault. It's really interesting that the numbers being quoted are directly from Nestle's website, and not from agencies who actually manage the water. Those agencies are issuing cease and desist orders, because Nestle diverts Water they have no right to, and get caught at it. And this is just one simple example, and Nestle of course doesn't want people to know, and you're helping Nestle keep the truth from them. So here's just one little example of a cease and desist order that had to be sent to Nestle to stop using water they had no rights to- and that's from a government agency.

I mean, they were. The Jews of mandatory Palestine accepted the Partition Plan, which gave them a much smaller country. The Arab Palestinians and surrounding Arab nations didn't, and trying to eradicate Israel. They failed, resulting in state similar to the '67 borders, except that because the neighbors never actually cared at all about the Palestinian Arabs (they were just antisemites who saw an opportunity to fairly the Jews and gain land), Jordan and Egypt kept the West Bank and Gaza, respectively.

Yes. Yes it is but.. it is very characteristic of this orange turd. No one should be surprised. It is also characteristic of his followers and the party that enabled him. They may be trying to create distance but I will stay here and remind the world that there are millions of "sane" conservatives that got in line, and would again, when this clown was saying the same nonsense in 2016. He is a loser and so is every conservative with him.

Honestly? As someone who was raised in a conservative house (but now actively fights against their politics), I genuinely weep at how deeply bankrupt these leaders are (both in the past, but especially now). There's a lot of times we say things like "the cruelty is the point", and that's all true... But I still want to live a life where I hope for the best in people. Where even people who do deeply wrong things act out of inner pain and can have moments of self reflection. Where I can at least empathize with my "enemies" and in that way live by the tradition of "love thine enemies" I was raised in.

i want to wish everyone a happy holiday, including the America-hating MAGAloids that nearly succeeded in destroying our country, the FBI for steadfastly investigating the former president who stole top-secret docs and tried to overthrow an election ensuring that a mentally stunted Russia-loving Donald Judas Trump cant run for office again, the department of justice for appointing a special prosecutor to investigate our criminally traitorous former president, and who couldn't possibly "hate 'trump' more than any person on earth" because that person is me.

"The Julian calendar has two types of years: a normal year of 365 days and a leap year of 366 days. They follow a simple cycle of three normal years and one leap year, giving an average year that is 365.25 days long. That is more than the actual solar year value of 365.24219 days (the current value, which varies), which means the Julian calendar gains a day every 128 years. For any given event during the years from 1901 to 2099 inclusive, its date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days behind its corresponding Gregorian date.".
I can assure you mobilisation won't be popular, whether there will be bombings or not, it was already proven by crimean bridge bombing that it does not raise patriotic motivation, even despite it being literally the most iconic accomplishment of putin and so called putins electorate's greatest pride. On the contrary, such events raise a lot of toxicity towards status quo in Russia due to unspoken agreement between government and average ivan ("you keep us secure and strong and we dont interfere too much in what you're doing").
I mean it feels like a catch-22. If the US acknowledges and has relations with a government, it’s their fault that government did bad things and why didn’t they stop him. If the US does something to depose a government, it’s a colonizing imperialist who’s undermining political stability and causing strife. On one hand it feels like you’re blaming the US for occupying Haiti, then you’re mad the US didn’t overthrow Haiti’s government. You can’t really have both, though.
We actively supported Papa Doc because he allowed US corporations to prosper, and before that we occupied and opened the market to those corporations which took profits outside the country. I was not saying we should have deposed the Duvaliers, and do not have a problem with peacekeeping forces we had there in the 90s, but we have some of the blame. I was certainly not saying internal corruption or the French played no role. And unrelated to any of those situations, Haiti is also in a geographical situation where earthquakes and hurricanes are common. There is a constellation of factors.
>Norway, a major donor to the Amazon Fund, has said the initiative for backing forest protection had been reactivated now that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was back in office and vowing to halt deforestation.
Fair enough. But I still think you would get a majority, not a vast one though. Especially when living in the Amazon means living in small "vacation-like" villages, hanging around with friends and family, doing rich people stuff (e.g. hunting, fishing, gathering wild food, etc.).

tbh with the current technology i would like to see more investment into creating more jungles and forest instead of protecting this one jungle, even tho is important, i do believe we have the information and the understanding to actually tackle deforestation it’s just that companies are to fcking greedy.

Yup. Plus regrowth is slow. If you cut down and burn a 100 year-old forest, it will take about 100 years to absorb back the CO2 that was released. In the best-case scenario.

For people who hate living in cities, another example, America building as densely as the Netherlands (tons of nature, parks, and even the 2nd biggest agricultural exporter) would concentrate US population in areas that together are the size of California. And re-forest the rest of the country...
They don’t want minorities to be treated equally because they understand that minorities are treated badly and instead of looking at it as “we will treat minorities better” they see it as “we will be treated as we have been treating them and that’s a hard pass”. I would find this very interesting coming from the “do unto others” group but they wouldn’t be conservative Republicans without the essential ingredient of Christian hypocrisy.

We hate that dishonest GOPists have their own dedicated propaganda industry Also, Democrats suck for not getting results you can only get with your own dedicated propaganda industry.
This is what happens when the GOP chooses to protect their own instead of their country. McCarthy's actions are a disgrace and he should be held accountable for his role in aiding the insurrectionists. It's clear that the GOP is more concerned with protecting their own interests than doing the right thing for our democracy. ShameOnMcCarthy ImpeachMcCarthy.
What the hell? Is this some kind of sick joke? That video is evidence of a coup attempt and Kevin McCarthy is just handing it over to someone that was actually promoting the riot? Absolutely disgusting. The GOP needs to take serious accountability for this and start putting country before party. No more excuses! WakeUpGOP AccountabilityNow.

What a joke. McCarthy is just trying to protect his own ass and he thinks that this "January 6 Riot Promoter" is going to help him do that? Yeah, right. The Republican Party's stance on January 6th has been nothing short of disgusting. They've done everything they can to minimize it and sweep it under the rug. It's outrageous and it needs to be accounted for. JusticeForJanuary6.
I disagree, and think Mulvaney effectively hamstrung the CPFB in a way that is, in my opinion, irrecoverable. Whether it was eliminating the ability for the org to demand settlements with lending institutions, or letting the credit bureau hack go unpunished, there is a long list of enacted by Mulvaney to kneecap the organization to the point of it being less of a regulatory institution than one set to "bargain" for damages in a way that protects credit, lending and banking institutions from more severe penalties and sanctions that the court system could enact. The purpose of the CFPB is more to protect these institutions from harsher penalty, as Mulvaney made it much more friendly to big banking/lending. Not being in the pocket of these institutions was the original point of the agency. Elizabeth Warren .
That's... not entirely true. The beauty of the CFPB is that its major functions are written into law via the Dodd-Frank Act. 2018 marks the year CFPB lost the case protecting its Director as for-cause, which ultimately didn't matter as the Trump administration engineered multiple bullshit reasons to fire whoever they needed to - proving that "for-cause" executive agency heads are not really a thing.

Did you go to college? Did you not take a single course outside of your major that had nothing to do with the job you hoped to get after graduation? If a college wants to offer a course in African American culture, who’s to say they shouldn’t? Sounds like it might be an interesting history or sociology elective.

DeSantis is "post-Trump Republicanism." Trump proved that dog whistles were largely unnecessary. You can just plain say, "I want to ban all Muslims from the country," and the Republican base will say that it's not islamaphobia. The previous incarnation of the Republican party basically had the concept of "bigotry is wrong, but as long as statements and policies ostenisibly have an articulable non-bigoted motivation, that's acceptable." That wasn't a good stance at all, but it provided some constraints. The current concept is "Bigotry is wrong. However, no statement or policy is bigoted, except any statement or policy that is intended to be anti-bigoted. Anti-bigotry is the real bigotry.".

No, there’s a fundamental difference between a school offering a degree or certification that might not get you a job in the field versus the school outright lying and saying “99% of our past graduates have gotten jobs within one year of graduation, with a median salary of $150k dollars.”.

The very long WaPo article cited on Wiki simply describes their investigative process a basically says "our hired experts separately found no evidence of hacking/manipulation and the majority of the emails were verified electronically but not 100%. and the email in question about 10% for the big man was verified by one of the recipients".

Absolutely! As tax payers we should get monthly updates on the various "investigations" they are starting, including legal outcomes (as in court cases).
OR... there's a tendency when places are popular that people crowd the space and eventually water down what initially made it cool until it's all about who can yell the loudest. It happened with older and intolerant people on Facebook, now it's happening to Twitter. Don't be surprised if when everyone abandons Twitter that they find and ruin another cool spot to be. Reddit is probably the biggest online forum after fb and Twitter (except maybe LinkedIn), so i kinda worry that people are going to migrate here and start rapid posting stupid shit without understanding the platform. It's a theory i call "blowing up the spot". There's nothing that annoys me more on social media than people who try to convince people just by being the loudest. It's not even about the message either, just their constant need for attention and validation. If your message is good then you don't have to yell.

If there's one thing that should impress upon people the importance of government and taxes, it's our military. Not because I think the world needs massive armies to kill each other, but because the logistics are second to none. It is absolutely amazing what our mobilized forces can do. Now imagine what we could accomplish if we used that for construction, repairs, etc, of civilian stuff. When NY rolled out the National Guard to help with COVID vaccinations, it was an absolute machine. It had to be the most efficient thing I've seen in a long time. No waiting (other than for my appointment time, but plenty of parking where I was), signs everywhere, in and out. If only we could use these powers for non-military things more often.
Exactly. With ships and aircraft many nations do shows of force and freedom of navigation exercises, along with intelligence gathering in international waters/ airspace. They're often "intercepted" or just shadowed, by their adversary, and it usually only makes news when one of them does something incredibly dangerous like maneuvering too close or causing a collision.
The appartment bombings by the FSB and GRU in 1999 were exposed as the work of the FSB in order to get putin into power and give a casus belli for attacking Chechnya. People directly effected and journalists called out the FSB for inconsistancies in the official line and FSB agents were caught planting bombs, and linked to other bombs. It still helped him to get the presidency. If he could get away with that then, he can get away with this now.
The Nazis actually had direct govermental control, policies of genocide, and invaded multiple countries. A small group of extremists in the middle east coordinated a terrorist attack that in the grand scheme, killed far less than the completely innocent lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians killed as a result of the War on Terror.

Oh! you’d probably be interested that even in my neck of the woods (Canada), we have seen a MASSIVE increase in funding for additional professors, courses, classrooms, and even GASP… research for renewable energy since around July?

- I did buy the book but haven't read it yet. Aside from the interview I linked above, I heard a Rachel Maddow interview of Pomerantz, and they discussed the difficulty of going after Trump for a very big and repeated violation of the law, which is that for decades his organization routinely and arguably illegally used tactics like reneging on their debts, using their clout to negotiate downward and get better deals. Apparently this is illegal, but is very difficult for a relatively small Manhattan DA office to go after. For my point here though I think it helps enforce that justice, with respect to this fiend who has done so much damage to our country, has been delayed for decades. Why does Bragg think it's ok to delay further.

Scientists studying the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica have found that warm water is melting weak spots in the glacier, worsening the effects of climate change. The glacier, known as the Doomsday Glacier, is the size of Florida and represents more than half a meter of global sea level rise potential, and could destabilize neighboring glaciers that have the potential to cause a further three-meter rise. Using an underwater robot vehicle and censors, the team of 13 U.S. and British scientists found that warmer water was making its way into crevasses and other openings, causing sideways melt of 30 meters or more per year. The findings underscore how climate change is reaching isolated Antarctica and could lead to more accurate climate change models. If the melting continues, it could cause devastating consequences, including sea levels rising and increased flooding.

The only way for this to happen is if we make green energy based consumption way way more plentiful and (more importantly) way cheaper BEFORE we implement carbon taxes.

It doesn't change things much in the Senate right now, but it will make a huge difference if Sinema decides to run for reelection in 2024 as an independent. In that case she'd almost surely be handing her Senate seat to whomever the GOP nominates in Arizona, because Sinema almost surely isn't popular enough among Democrats to beat a Republican, and instead she'd just peel moderate and independent voters away from the Democratic candidate.
How is this even legal? You go and pull the lever/push the button to vote for a Dem, and then while they're in office they can just say "kidding, I'm X now"... Or better question is how is it legal for Senators/Congresspeople to vote against the majority of their states' views? People elect REPRESENTATIVES that are meant to go and vote the direction the state majority wants, not go and insert their own values. Zero fucking accountability in this system.

What? She’s most likely doing this to shore up her re-election chances. She’ll absolutely caucus with the democrats, but being an independent means she can’t be primaried in 2024.

I'm not racist I'm a realist. Nothing I've ever said has been racist. You can go anywhere else in Canada and be served in French because that Is the law of the nation you live in. Quebec decides to ban all services to anyone in English unless you are a historic Anglo. Unfortunately, when you go online there is no filter that allows for you to enter your parents kindergarten registration. I respect the rule of law. I respect the character of human rights in Canada. I respect your right to be exclusively French. I do not respect creating a language police with rights to illegal search and seizure of small business and homes. I do not respect limiting places in post secondary institutions under the preface of protection of language, when these actions are not supported by research, science or communal support among educators. Every action being taken now will drive away the majority of the next generation of quebec youth. Thank God there is the process of natural selection. The French monoculture is going to die out in 2 generations. The regions industries are already failing due to the highest aging population in the country. The youth move away for a less repressive regime..Voila. systemic collapse. Just like the 70's.
my impression when visiting it was always that the linguo-cultural conservativism there is also supposed to push against politically conservative anglo-american ideas, and to get into closer contact to the political ideologies of other romance-speaking languages in Europe and the Americas.
Not that anyone asked, im sure the details will come out. However I assume it often starts with a friendly face, a “lets sit down, have a conversation” i bet these cheesy fucks even add some pageantry to it. Three men in a Mercedes arrive. They have red wine, flowers, some frozen fish they will send to your family from the state.
This is ultimately the problem with fascists and authoritarian regimes: eventually all the competent people who would disagree are either rounded up or sufficiently cowed into silence, leaving you with incompetent leadership trying to execute its vision with incompetent sycophants. So far in the history of the world this has not ended well.

Where "fail" is defined by an already delusional psychopath that implicitly demands you tell him what he wants to hear, even if it's a lie, but following through on lying will also encourage him to decide you "failed" when the truth is now not ignorable by not giving it to him truthfully, which also would have been a "fail.".

Corrupt authoritarianism can emerge from both central-planned government-run industry as well as monopolized "privately held" industry. It takes real distributed power and competition to avoid the perils of having too much power in one place.
I think he was talking about wars and atrocities in Africa, China’s attack on India and Bhutan for land grab etc where West stayed quite. More of the colonial mindset to say, etc.
I get the hate but y’all need to brush up on history , Pakistan has been a US ally since it’s creation and both US and Pakistan were instrumental in building the mujahideen to fight the soviets , once the Cold War was over , the US went home and Pakistan was left to take care of the mujahideen which by then had grown really unstable and splintered into different groups , one of those became the taliban and certain factions that Pakistan army still had control over , had other geopolitical problems and then you see US returning back to Afghanistan and more extremism happening and once the war on terror is over , the US throws Pakistan to the side and starts cozying up india and Iran so Pakistan also makes more links with china to prioritize their national security interests and it’s a really complex topic . But tldr the Pakistani army has for decades been very pro US and a US major non nato ally , just that they grew abit distant with the war on terror . And for the ones who have been saying bin laden was found in Pakistan , US has done nothing to Saudi regime when there has been evidence that the house of Al saud directly funded 9/11 and bin laden was Saudi not Pakistani , and all the hate towards bin laden goes to Pakistan for some reason. Also you don’t want Pakistan and china having a full time alliance as that would be a diaaster in itself, china would gain access to the Indian Ocean and the Arabian gulf , about 600 extra nukes than India , both could hang up on India in the Himalayan region and India wanting to be independent means once everything is done , the US could lose a stronghold or backup in the South Asian region and it could seriously affect trade routes and US influence in the region.
We are witnessing the end of Russia as a meaningful player on the world stage and economy. They were already demographically terminal but this is going to leave massive gaps in their society and workforce that will echo through the next century at least. Unreal.
Putin and Zelenskyy should fight it out 'mano a mano'. Somehow I don't think Putin has the balls for it, but Zelenskyy would. All wars should be fought this way.

This is also why so many Russians say shit like "oh I don't do politics" because discussion of politics inevitably devolves into either endorsing Putin or denouncing Putin and denouncing Putin is to admit that Russians were wrong to support him and elect him as he was at one point at least and arguably still is widely popular.

Using my math? My math is "all the women are still there, so there's no change." You can quadruple the number of dead and it won't change anything. Every hundredth man will just impregnate two women. 20 years later, the same kids are in college like nothing ever happened. Demographically.

Just anecdotal, I've not done a double blind study, but... Yeah never underestimate the lenhs Russians will go to in order to avoid admitting fault.
The neoconservative ideology is absolutely a tool of the oligarchs, who meanwhile have enjoyed record profits and massive redistribution of wealth from the bottom up.

Love my girl Hillary. She folcked up by taking Tim Kaine for VP. Plain and simple. I thought she had it together til that move. If she would’ve taken Sherrod from Ohio for example. She would have won. Don’t forget. She won the popular vote. My thoughts.
I don't think it is plausible for an e-voting scheme to withstand that level of scrutiny, especially the implementation of such a scheme, and even if it was theoretically plausible, the details as to why would be inscrutable enough that it would be an effective "just trust me bro" for virtually all of the people voting, which is not what engenders trust in election results.
You included a link to fvap.gov. I can see where the states are empowered to send overseas voters Absentee Ballot Applications by electronic means, but my quick perusal did not find how the voters could vote by email.

Yes, I agree that electronic / email voting would be much more convenient, but it opens the door for increased fraud, as well as complaints from voters who supposedly do not have email access, but want similar convenience.

With all the (unfounded) complaints of fraudulent voting, methinks opening the entire state to email voting would cause a much heavier workload on the verification process to try to assure the absence of fraud.

Exactly. Engaging on the subject gives it credibility. Changing the subject is something Republicans are very good at and it gets attention. It might make you feel better to think that you're countering the narrative but like wrestling with a pig, you end up getting all muddy and the pig enjoys it.

Exactly. While it does appear to be his laptop, the chain of custody was so shoddy that there's no way any information on it could be confirmed as authentic. Even previous forensic analysis done on it and the contents determined that there was forgery and manipulation.
Not as poor as you might think. Officially they don't have much in the way of GDP, but unofficially they are networked into a massive international black market they use to fund things like their military and nuclear weapons program. It's been a while since I read up on it but from what I recall they make billions in the smuggling of weapons and drugs, human trafficking, counterfeiting currencies and more. They are networked into criminal syndicates globally.
I agree. I also think that the type of story plays a role in the perceived reliability of eye-witness accounts. If an eye-witness is describing first hand accounts of documented events, I am much more likely to believe them than somebody describing an event that they are the only documented witnesses of.

To be clear, I’m not saying that eye-witness accounts are more or less reliable depending on the kind of information they’re offering. I think that for the most part, eye-witness accounts are merely something that should be used to spark interest in a subject. I don’t think they should be used as evidence or be taken as fact until something objective has been established.

Not necessarily. They could be omitting important information such as if they had more serious offenses besides the movies which would make more sense.
Yeah we’ve heard this shit the last decade or so ‘ the Republican Party is dying ‘ so everyone gives them great advise and what do they do? Double down into stupid and dry hump fascism and they they get shellacked again and they have a brief moment of introspection and then decide ‘ no no everyone else is wrong , our version of conservatism isn’t the problem ‘ and then double down, just wait their isn’t going to be a Saul on the road to Damascus moment , they are going to go full bore fascist crazy like never before in a few days.
No. Trump was never the problem and it's Republican voters who are to blame. They can't be allowed to get away imposing him on us and then dropping him with no consequences.

Unfortunately, that's a distinct possibility. Even the Raffensberger call is more of an uphill battle to prosecute than you'd expect. The relevant Georgia law requires the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Trump intended for Raffensberger to commit election fraud. The tricky part is that he didn't actually say that: the words he said, taken literally, suggest he believed there were illegal votes and illegally discarded votes, and he wanted Raffensberger to investigate to find enough of these fraudulent votes to prove that he actually won Georgia. Of course this is complete bullshit, and we all know what he really meant, but the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove that he meant something different than what his words said. Unfortunately, proving Trump's guilty mindset at the time of the call is essential to convicting this crime.

I see it from a more universalist perspective, its all human history and culture and so its of global interest to preserve it. I don't think a current government or insititutions in any country have automatic given right to it just because the artefact originated in the same location a long time ago. They would have a good claim but not an absolute one.
Damn just saw this, I meant South America not south Africa, there's this book: Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galeano and there's the math done for all the actual value of the stuff that was stolen, in fact when adjusted for all the centuries of inflation it was of course much more than the 7 trillion, was a couple of times the world's GDP, and it was at that time instrumental to the development of the contintent until the end of the colonies shortly after the French revolution. My comment, obviously captious, was targeting the fact that Europe has never manifested to return the lovely precolumbine art pieces of which you can barely find a few in South American museums, mainly well, cus they were made of gold and certainly they're lost forever.

The video is good. But although I can agree with him on the general principle, he deals very dismissively with the point about how the other countries will care for the artefacts. This would vary on case by case basis and I dont think it should be ignored.
An important precursor to the first industrial revolution in Europe was the so-called Second Agricultural revolution, or British Agricultural revolution, a hundred-year period from \ 1670-1770 where agricultural yields consistently improved year-over-year in excess of the rate of population growth, due to determined, capitalistic focus by certain people to increase the yields of their lands and use those yields to increase (by purchase or lease) the amount of land they farmed. The signature method was the four-field system, championed by Lord President Charles "Turnip" Townsend. Not any sort of industrial machinery.
Everywhere. Every trade agreement India makes includes clauses that ease the migration of Indian migrants to the trade partner country. And of course many still keep families in India so the money still flows to India. It’s clever economics.

I suppose their antics is what a lot of Republican voters wanted; But there’s just a lot of uninformed voters in this country that got once again suckered into voting for these assholes and what they they were selling because they wanted to stick it to the Dems for high gas prices (at the time) and inflation, instead of actually understanding how global economics work.

The Republicans don’t seem to realize that they have a razor-thin majority in the house and that a significant number of Republicans will not support these measures and will support some Democratic bills because they can see which way the wind is blowing and they want to get re-elected in two years.

The vast majority of people I went to school with were good people and are doing good things now. You get shitty people from anywhere and they all find ways to succeed. Just because someone went to an Ivy doesn’t make them bad and just because someone went to a state school doesn’t make them good. Wall Street pulls from everywhere and they are equally bad.

I actually understated it. Adams won by about 7k votes and there were 140K inactive votes in the end. About 85K of those votes disappeared when Wiley was eliminated, with the ones who did put a next pick going about 2-1 for Garcia.

When Wiley was eliminated, Wiley voters who put someone next were highly skewed to Garcia. But... tons of them put no one next, so their votes were tossed out.

State law allows the NY Supreme Court to remove local officials for ‘’misconduct, maladministration, malfeasance or malversation in office” after an application by a citizen of that town/district or by the county DA to the Appellate Division of the NY Supreme Court. The governor is also allowed to remove local officials who are charged with crimes. Those are the only mechanisms to remove local officials in the state, because NY doesn’t have a recall mechanism.
Plus, where is Russia going to get equipment to outfit these extra 500k soldiers? Their current army isn't properly equipped. It's crazy how far they are willing to take this farce. Every step they take makes them a bigger pariah on an international scale. The West is less and less willing to work with them, while the East takes bigger advantage of their poor standing for personal gain. All of which makes Russia weaker and weaker.
Plus, unlike Russia in Ukraine, American forces in Vietnam never lost a single battle (you're welcome to look it up if you doubt it), although in the end their Zero-Loss battle record was immaterial to preventing the North from conquering the South when the South was corrupt as shit and not love by many of its citizens and the North could continue sending soldiers at an unstoppable rate - barring someone invading them to prevent that (which wasn't going to happen with the Soviet Union backing them).

"A superb idea. Medvedev might come back from China with a goodie bag. Let's take the future of our country and flush it. Nobody fears us any more. Skilled people have deserted. We're running low on hardware and supplies for more troops. Our demographics are already screwed. Nah let's give it a go I've nothing left to lose".

Unironically yes. Russia is still one of the bigger gas providers and Ukraine is one of the biggest cereal producers. If Russia manages to sphere Ukraine then the west won't have a lot of options left. Even if Russia loses (assuming that there is still a Russia by that time) it won't take more than a couple of decades to rebuild economic ties. NATO needs to score a decisive victory as soon as possible so it can have an advantage on the negotiations table.

As an edgy atheist, goddamn was it frustrating watching so many of those assholes go "well religion is stupid and clearly wrong but the societal norms created by the people who believed all that shit (the societal norms I grew up immersed in) are absolutely perfect, why should I look at those as critically as the religion I like to make fun of?".

Yeah, it's basically saying that the conspiratorial mindset doesn't discriminate, so when crunchy eco leftists wind up on the same conspiracies as the alt-right like being anti-fluoridation, it's easy for cross-pollination to occur and for them to be sucked in.

I know someone in this realm. Great guy, fun to be around, def seemed "hippieish" enough. Strict vegetarian, only shopped at farm markets, eschewed a lot of traditional medicine, big into spirituality, healing through music, etc. These are all fine attributes and who am I to say otherwise.

Good-ish, I guess. I mean it’s a win for consumers but Kotick will still be head of the company(and he’s got a lotta ties to Right-Wing Oligarchs) and the company as it stands is a septic tank of feces. Also can they also look at the Albertsons/Kroger buyout!?

I bought a small used solar panel, MSR gasoline stove, 2 laterns, 4 flashlights on ebay/amazon 3 weeks ago, still waiting for delivery. Planes can't land in Ukraine, so they have to land in Europe and unload there. Can't imagine what people that a waiting for a complete blackout gonna do. Shops are already out of stoves and propane canisters (thanks to AliExpress that sells $1 adapter that allows to refuel them). Other camping gear is out of stock or 2-3x price. No 70+Ah car batteries, power stations like ecoflow are $1000+, I can sell my 10yo 300w car inverter for crazy money. So yeah, any gear can be helpful, but make sure that it will be delivered, there are many cases when people donate to a scammers and gear/money just disappears. Find trusted source that have proven record of successful work.
It's very similar in Slovakia, particularly with Bratislava, mainly for the same issue you've described - actually changing your "permanent residence" officially is a bureaucratic hassle that most don't want to go through with unless absolutely necessary.

How can they not be? All stores offer them. Overall losses have been consistent between 2016 and 2021. Losses are computed by checking book inventory against store inventory, they aren't calculating losses by catching people stealing.

Of course it is. I almost accidentally shoplifted the other day when at an automated cashier I accidentally forgot to scan the small can of food I had and put it directly into the bag.

Exactly. Nobody leaves a good-paying job to rob liquor stores and sell drugs. People do these things because they don't have better options. Very few people would choose to be criminals if they had a better way to support themselves.
Your argument still makes no sense lol. The phones that sell that "cheap" aren't exported because they're made specifically for India. And, not to mention, because of PPP 10,000 is a LOT of money to a lot of people. You can get really good phones for 10,000. I have lived in the UK and in India and a phone which cost me £120 in the UK was worse in every way than the phone I just bought in India for Rs. 11,000 (about 100-110 GBP). It's called economics of scale lol.
constitutionally, Minorities have more rights than people of higher caste, he literally mentioned how lower caste people get special seats reserved just for them in medical, engineering colleges and they don't have pay a single rupee for 4/5 years of education plus accommodation.

Oof. I'm trying not to read too much into that. Are you talking about the gross disparity of economics between the various classes, and how that will allow for the exploitation of the underclasses to benefit the upper class? And then, are you indicating that's a good thing?
The WMDs were chemical weapons and they were found in Iraq and Syria. Saddam killed millions of Kurds and ethnic Shias. He killed tens of thousands of children alone. He started wars against Kuwait, Iran, and bullied his neighbors. His children were maniacal rapists and murderers. Saddam was evil and so was his brutal regime. The world is a safer place without him and the Baathist’s in power.
Honestly a full coverage swim suit (which is basically what a burkini is with an added flowy swim cap, if you ignore the emotional aspects of it) is not at all offensive, and it saddens me (as an atheist white woman who doesn't swim because I feel uncomfortable in public in swimwear) that women are denied it because asshats who hate women (and let's be honest the right hates women) want to pretend that it is oppressive, while they oppress women in countless other ways.

Yeah, that's possible/plausible, but I will just say that I have extensive experience around pools and aquatics in general (including water safety training like what lifeguards have to have) over a period of about 15 years and I've basically never seen this be an actual safety/liability issue. In fact, anyone that lives in and spends significant time around pools in areas that regularly have a high UV index (like I have) should be familiar with seeing people wearing clothing that covers much of the body for sun safety. I've seen and known of people to lap swim for over an hour with basically their entire body covered in order to protect their skin, albeit it's not very loose fitting, but my point is still that this can totally be made to work safety/practicality-wise.
However, those who have been tuned to this channel for a few decades have no illusions. Should nuclear war break out, some of Russias warheads will get home. They are well versed in both crucial components of rocketry and warheads. They possess sufficient volume to saturate the field. They have tested and deployed new weapons this year. Do they have some duds, I'm sure of it. Will that matter? No.
You know there’s a part of me that suggests Ukraine has the equal right to waste missiles on Russian civilian infrastructure but at the same time there’s mountains of evidence to suggest failed WW2 tactics of terrorizing people into submission aged about as poorly as you’d have expected. Those missiles are invaluable assets that Russia is not going to replace very easily atleast if not total losses, Ukraine uses its ordinance however on meaningful targets and these bombings of civilian targets just show how Russia is absolutely desperate for -anything- to feed its audience at home to show they’re not stalemated with Ukraine or outright failing to live up to their military prestige.

No one does. At this point the US and Ukraine, the two most important players other than Russia have already said under the current circumstances any talks are pointless and they wouldn't entertain it.
>The remains of the two-metre (6.5ft) fish were found at the Gesher Benot Yaaqob archaeological site which spans the River Jordan about 14km (8.5 miles) north of the Dead Sea.
Yeah seriously. If a fella wants to be a sensationalist, let him. If he wants to say speculation is proof in itself without really evidence yet, let the dude do it. If he wants to sell nonsense and folks buy into it and shift funding away from the people doing the real work, you gotta just let him grift you. Come on jeez!

we should either see various stars shining only in the infrared spectrum if interstellar travel is impossible for some reason (no good reason to think it is of course), or expanding bubbles of stars having this happen to them, especially in distant galaxies, or most likely, we should see nothing at all and not exist because all stars already have dyson swarms around them.

Same. I think about it all the time. If anatomically identical humans have been walking around since about 300,000+ years ago I find it hard to believe there weren't at least simple societies and technologies. They could have even been iron age level technology and there would be no traces left, considering decomposition.
There is no such thing as a self-sufficient country. International cooperation is necessary for prosperity. The problem is not self-sufficiency, but overdependence on specific countries.
Really?! COVID and other diseases come from China. One from a lab and the others from ‘wet’ markets. Testing anyone coming from China is prudent and pragmatic. Two great characteristics of the Chinese.

I mean, arguably the rest of the West should be trying to increase cooperation while reducing military and economic dependence on the United States, not because the US are bad actors or have some specific issue, but because it’s just dangerous in the long term regardless.

Yes, I agree. The U.S. has done a really good job of creating an international, rules based order, that most countries can benefit from, if they follow international norms. I see China as a threat to this system, and having an even more widely distributed, internationally represented, military force from many different countries, would be a strong signal to China that they need to try to join the club, instead of challenging it.
Specifically, elected officials who aren’t privy to what national defense knows or is doing hopped on television and started shouting about how weak the nation is because we hadn’t shot it down yet. Never mind that intelligence was monitoring the thing and playing dumb while they did a bunch of classified shit. The politicians ended up revealing how little information they’re trusted with, many international dick heads probably played the things they said on their state news all weekend, and people who actually address these issues had to waste valuable time concocting excuses and cover stories about why they hadn’t acted yet.
Yup. Plus if the military experiences a national security incursion because of a surveillance balloon flew over ICBM silos then the balloon is not the problem at hand.

I have lived both sides. My husband and I were low blue collar in the 80s. I would say my husband was nearly dirt poor. We both worked summers like dogs. 60+ hours a week to try to pay for as much of our upcoming school year as we could and we both took out student loans for the rest. We worked 20 hours a week during the school year. It was HARD, but not impossible. Let me tell you what has changed. I have raised four children now, and all college educated. They worked in the summers. But, nobody will give a kid 60 hours anymore. And, if they try to piece together two part time jobs, employers don't like that because they have to schedule around another job. This seriously limits their ability to make enough money in the summers to pay tuition and fees and then also housing. People think they are "just kids" so they pay them GARBAGE wages as if they don't have a desire for a future. Rent. OMG, the cost of RENT. All of my kids took out the standard student loan amounts and it paid for approximately half of their tuition, fees and living expenses. HALF. All came out with $30,000 in debt and only because we picked up the other half. So, essentially, my husband and I paid for our own schooling, then paid for the equivalent of two more in our late adulthood. I am not asking for anyone to pay for our kids. We had them, but when ignorant ass people try to compare going to university today with when we went, I want to kick them in the ass. Everything is exponentially more expensive: Books, fees, rent, transportation, food... health insurance. We have monetized education for the rich. If I had anything to say to employers is to PLEASE pay your summer college bound workers a more than fair wage. Think of it as an investment into their future. These kids DO want to work, but are absolutely drowning with no where to go to make this happen for them if they don't have family who has already "made it.".

In the 70s and 80s the British government locked up hundreds of innocent Irish men, sometimes for years. All it served to do was deepen the hatred. "For every man they took away they dressed one thousand more".
I am not justifying that , I am just saying the US is a hypocrite if they want to ride the morally superior horse after doing all kinds of shit , they should first look at themselves before accusing/blaming china for their gain , let’s admit it the US doesn’t want china to develop further as if would threaten their hegemony and compromise their empire which itself is propped up on wars , every single time there is a disaster at home , the US goes on a war killing innocents in Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan twice (first when Afghanistan was ruled by socialists and then they propped up terrorist to defeat the soviet ideology and then they went back to fight the same terrorists they grew in the first place all the while killing innocent civilians in the name of greater good) , they literally saved nazi scientists as long as they could be used for their benefit , staged coups all across the world , destabilize democratic governments and replaced them with dictators or instability to protect cooperate interests and extract resources for cheap and benefit the military establishment , they knew the Saudi royal family was responsible for 9/11 but they stayed silent becuz they didn’t want their petrodollar to be threatened again when kashoggi was openly killed by the Saudis , Biden goes and dies fist bumps with the Saudi crown prince and did discriminate drone attacks on civilians which caused them to join Islamic Extremists in anger and further increased instability and religious extremism in the Middle East and much more , i am not supporting what China has done with the camps but the US calling out china while being a shameless hypocritical cunt sounds disgusting.
I imagine that Chinese aid isn't so much aid officially as it is the Chinese government turning a blind eye to Chinese companies selling all sorts of stuff to the Russians against sanctions or "letting it fall off the back of a truck". There's thousands of miles of border shared with Russia and China, they can pass stuff to the russians at will and no one will know what they're actually sending, and since it's not government mandated the Chinese government gets plausible deniability.
Lol not anymore. Only last year they had to spend something like 800 billions to replace Russian resources. German industrial capabilities are no longer competitive especially with that new USA green subsidy law that made it even more compelling to move all the production to States. EU losing autonomity is what USA and Brits want so that they can pressure them into their influence. Now USA has a place to sell their super expensive liquidated gas, steals industries and threatens euro strenh as we saw back in summer. This war bleeds EU dry all while letting States enjoy new military and trade contracts which were not on the plate before because Union did not need them thanks to cheap Russian resources.
And that's just patently absurd, in addition to being irrelevant. While there might be other things besides religion that are bad, religion very much is one of the worst offenders, and also, there obviously are huge differences in how easily ideas can be abused for bad purposes, from religion, which is pretty much purpose-built for that by virtue of being based on the epistemology of faith (i.e., the epistemology that says that you can determine whether a given claim is factually true or not by believing that it is true), to, I dunno, humanism and skepticism, which would be quite hard to use for bad goals.
20% Arabs. I mean full citizenship. Exactly same rights. Even less obligations - they don't have to do the mandatory army service, but can if they want to. Some do. Were represented in the previous government. How is it apartheid ethnostate? Yes, there's also a big religious population in the country. Some of them are seeing Judea and Samaria (aka West Bank) as their ancestors lands. Some don't recognize Israel as a state at all. It is hugely complex situation, and there's lots of bad blood on both sides, but to paint Israelis as some cartoon villains? You said you don't support Hamas. You realize they have to be fought with somehow? You expect people fighting them to be Buddhas? How?
Well, probably you didn't do enough, but did the others? Do you have a right to voice this hypocrisy? When even now not all sanctions imposed against Kremlin and Russian elites, but to satisfy angry mob western governments take pseudo-measures that target regular russians only.
And speaking of which sanctions target regular russians specifically, already mentioned travel ban is prime example. Regular russians don't travel much due being, well, quite poor and for them it was mostly a way to escape from Russia, especially during mobilization, while many russian elites still enjoy second citizenship or permanent residency in countries of Europe.

Maybe. There are various reasons - money, elderly parents, disabilities - that means some decent people can’t leave. Some people might actually want their home to change and stay and fight in some way. Not all Russians are horrible people, anymore than all Americans are (although as an American, I think the vast majority of the majority ethnicity here are completely spoiled and far too comfortable to get that most people in the world actually face hardship).
There are not enough people in the US available to enforce the laws 100%. Not enough border agents, judges, court clerks, lawyers, bailifs, case workers, guards, transcriptionists... etc. People like you seem to present this "fix" that if we only followed and enforced the law exactly as written then it would be perfect. Except to have your model work we'd have to significantly shift taxes to border control and have huge staffing increases and the people to fill those positions just are not there. We'd have to train them or get them in school and wait for them to become available. In the mean time all other parts of the economy suffer from a similar lack of labor. Which could be solved by any sort of sane immigration reform i.e. understanding that many workers would be fine as seasonal migrant workers and return home if they were given the ability to do so easily.but the process is over complicated, the quotas too low, and many businesses that rely on the migrant workers would rather it stay that way to benefit from gaming the system for low wage workers that won't get into disputes over wage theft, safety, or workers rights. You are simply trying to fix the wrong end of the equation.

The problem is in one end we have Governor brownback in Kansas who kept in letting taxes more and more promising that it would actually increase revenue, and that provided revenue increase never came, only further deficits and lots of government services, and in the other hand, i can't recall a single time the Laffer curve had ever been proven true. Hypothetically, if there was a 100% tax rate, then I suppose lowing the tax rate to 90% would probably lead to a revenue increase since people would actually be willing to work, but in real life, even with the extremely high tax rates of the 40's and 50's, raising tax rates, even to extraordinary high rates leads to revenue increases and letting the tax rate, even on extraordinary high rates leads to revenue decrease.
Is it? Or is it that the Dems do do some shit, but the GOP takes the cake. For example, when it comes to sex crimes, the GOPs crimes heavily outweigh the Dems, yet the Rs blame the Dems. When it comes to spend, the GOP has consisentley increased the debt but blame the Dems. Wars as well, taking away freedoms, etc etc.
no offense but I would trust WHO over some Indian pharma companies…the Indian officials are equally likely to protecting their financial interests by denying the claims…interesting they don’t say none of the compounds were found in the medicine, they just say the medicines complied with specifications….
Nope. Checked it(i am an indian). WHO is not providing clear facts for complete investigation and indian officials have t found anything wrong in syrup. Its commonly used in india.

So The Gambia reports some child illnesses and deaths and find it’s related to one companies cough medicines, they test it and it shows toxic chemicals are present which exactly line up with the symptoms the children are experiencing…The Gambia stops all sales of that particular medicine and the deaths and illness decline…thats pretty clear…so I’m not sure how this is a conspiracy of the WHO…how do they benefit from this??? As per you Covid-19 comment…can you please show the WHO press release from Nov 2019 where they stated that Covid-19 is not contagious…since it was only first reported by a doctor in Wuhan on Dec 1 2019 and reported to the WHO on the 31st of Dec 2019..and it was in the public eye until Jan/Feb the next year..
I see this kind of stuff all of the time. It's like they might as well say they don't think you are as important even if you were also a victim because you don't have the right skin color. It's just racist. Can't we look at people individually without looking at skin color? So sad!
Meanwhile Georgia is trying to reproduce the limited distributorship model from the liquor industry. The proposed laws statutorily limit us to six distributors. Guess who gets to give away the distributorships? Yep, the state legislators. Of course no money will change hands I'm sure.

No one is being discriminated against besides black ppl who were previously targeted 100% more than whites, who were unfairly convicted when whites would go free, and who are unfairly being kept from the industry because of that unfairness. White ppl can do whatever they want with zero restrictions. Do you get it now?

before you even worry about potential foreign influence and national security you should consider the immeasurable and likely irreversible damage that has already been done by giving corporate and financial interests complete control over this country’s entire legislative process at nearly governing level.

There's no longer an elected government but there's still a guy - Ariel Henry - calling himself the President and Prime Minister occupying government offices and is internationally recognized as the head of state. He's not elected but he's in power, he was designated as the next PM before the previous president was assassinated. The PM is supposed to succeed the president in case of an emergency but since there was already no elected parliament at the time, he was never confirmed in accordance to the constitution.
Irrelevant. That occurred over 200 years ago. The grand children of those freed slaves are long dead. As pointed out, any country can rise from abject poverty to become a developed country in less than two generations. South Korea is the poster child of that.

Because there's a difference between the common understanding of anarchy (basically chaos) and the ideological/political understanding of Anarchy.

No. They were all in the US. The presidential massacre just put more eyes on it. The Haitian government has been extraordinarily corrupt and has little to no regard for the actual Haitian people.

It makes things worse and the government would suddenly come back to hijack aid to profit off of it leaving the Haitian citizens with nothing they couldn’t be able to purchase from the government via the black market.
I suppose fuck politicians in general. They are really for themselves. The biggest high profile sham artists in the world.
Finally, it is also practical considerations regarding the practicalities and financial constraints surrounding the idea which render its implementation impractical at best. To begin with, although it could be argued that America still owes some form of reparation debt due to historic oppression, this could prove impossible given that individuals who would have been responsible for these injustices no longer exist nor do records exist as to what level and extent each person was directly involved or responsible for these injustices. Secondly there would need to be an agreed criteria whereby claimants could legitimately make claims based on historic suffering which any award could address – leading onto further disagreement as different parties seek different outcomes from such discussions leading towards discord instead of harmony between racial groups within society today.
Hopefully, Fetterman is in a similar situation to my husband and will basically fully recover in time. I don’t know his medical details, but I would guess he had an ischemic stroke (caused by a blood clot) versus a hemorrhagic stroke (brain bleed) based on how quickly he was back at work. Ischemic strokes have a much better prognosis than hemorrhagic strokes, especially when treated quickly. Similar to my husband, he was likely given TPA drugs to bust up the clot, limiting the amount of time the clot prevented oxygen from traveling throughout the brain. The shorter the time the clot blocked blood flow, the less likely it is for the damage to be lasting. The brain can recover to an extent and build new connections, especially when the damage is limited through quick treatment. If the doctors can determine the cause of the stroke (ie atrial fibrillation, hole in the heart, etc), which they do in +90% of stroke cases, his long term health outlook will be even better. Give him some more time and I bet you’ll see a marked improvement.
Absolutely. The Democrats need to start intensively recruiting military/blue collar, white straight dudes with drawls and foul mouths ASAP. And I say this as a gay Arab dating a trans person.
I am almost at the point of willing to believe that gun control is a Republican plot to retain power by scaring their base. I’ve said it for years and will continue to say it until something changes: if dems kept every single policy position but stopped with the gun control and actually embraced the 2nd amendment, they would probably never lose another national election, and could actually enact all of the other great stuff they want with little trouble. Legalize weed too, and their dominance would be assured. But nooooo.

Exactly. They’ll enforce it for any event they want and exclude the events (like sports) that they like. The law is specifically written to protect the “in groups” and exclude others.

Exactly. The law is terribly vague and can’t be enforced in any manner that doesn’t explicitly target trans people, since assholes like this think being trans is “impersonating”.
Even current government, that supports Ukraine, is quite populist. Leader of mayor party in the government attacked own institution because they did not want to approve Sputnik vaccine. Often praising Orban etc.
The craziest thing is that our neonazis who, until now celebrated the WWII nazi-regime in Slovakia and largely denied both the holocaust and the significance of the Russian-led insurgency of 1945, fraternize with the Russian extremists and present themselves as "anti-war", which literally translates into: Let's not help Ukraine, let it fall into Russian hands, because all evil comes from the NATO and the US - nothing wrong can come from this.".

I find it odd that there’s still so many people in Eastern Europe that have experience with the freedoms and stability that being part of the EU and NATO afford them yet are willing to side with Russia, especially after Russia’s escapades in Georgia, Moldova, Armenia/Azerbaijan, Crimea, Syria, and now it’s attempted genocide in Ukraine.

Thank you! Sounds like business as usual. Far be it from Pellegrini to express an actual opinion on anything.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Oh thank goodness! We'll finally be able to use one of those "defense contractor" missiles we pay over a trillion dollars a year for. Every year.

In terms of semiconductor manufacturing? About time we shifted away from Taiwan. Props to Biden for that.

While the Whitehouse/Pentagon/MSM mouthpiece is busy making excuses about its limited ability to obtain data and how shooting the balloon down in the middle of nowhere is somehow dangerous to non-existent civilians, the balloon's actual goal of creating High Definition maps of the underground silos using an advance EM/GPR/ Acoustic Light penetrative field (DAS) has already been completed.

The chip embargo doesn’t hurt them all that much. In fact, Chinese nuclear scientists have published their research which specifies using equipment that they aren’t supposed to have.
That took a change of consciousness for many heterosexuals , many of whom we supportive of gay rights but felt the country wasn't ready for gay marriage when the issue came to the fore. But once the arguments were laid out, they were easy converts. I remember feeling uneasy about gay marriage at first and listened to the arguments for it. I arrived at a concept of marriage that was gender blind and I thought we should be encouraging gay marriage for all the social policy reasons we encourage mixed sex marriage. The country really moved fast on the issue once it broke to the forefront of social issues. It is.

No no it's not. The amount of young white folk I've met that were against my white boyfriend marrying me or making babies with me just because I'm not white really shocked me. Generational? No. Educational? Probably.

How are they being withheld? Where's the physical barrier or individual, or law stopping people from outperforming others? I agree the system is broken. With that in mind, why rely on the same system to help the unfranchised?

Dude. You know what alarms do? Some of them do nothing. Some call a security firm who then contact the police. Some call the police.

Interesting guess. I hadn't thought of that. You'd think NBC would investigate who and why this source leaked erroneous information to Almaguer and make that transparent. On the other hand, all the networks could air a live presser with everyone involved in this case painstakingly laying out every single detail, and a third of the country would choose to discredit it. They don't even care about whether their beliefs are true or not. They just choose to believe made up bullshit.
