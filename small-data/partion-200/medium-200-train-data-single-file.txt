How is this comment considered okay? It wouldn’t be okay to say something like this about any other country. It’s my country, I was born and raised there, why do you wish it to be burn with its beautiful nature and people, instead of saying something like “I want the Russian army to burn, I want peace, and I want to see both Ukraine and Russia become democratic and prosperous countries”? If you really believe all Russians are evil, then you have no idea what’s going on there. Every Friday roscomnadzor bans a bunch of Russian organizations and individuals who are pro-LGBT/anti-war/anti-corruption etc. These are thousands of people working as the opposition to Pootin. If you check a telegram channel named “romasuperromasuper”, you’ll see there Taras Shevchenko’s (a Ukrainian poet) memorial in Saint Petersburg with flowers brought by Russians after the tragedy in Dnipro. There were numerous mass protests against Putin (Bolotnaya square, for example), or when brave journalists or leaders of the opposition were killed or jailed. There are millions of Russians who want this to stop. They want to live in a peaceful and prosperous country, but they have no leader, and a protest without a leader is futile. Armless people just get jailed for bringing flower to a Ukrainian memorial or doing literally anything against their government.
Also could be important as a lot of people think that Russia should not have simply just inherited the USSR’s position on the UNSC. Continuity of government sometimes matters.

I personally think the abuse of the PPP money is probably one of the major contributors to the inflation that the US is experiencing. I'm sure there are other factors as well, but handing out a Trillion dollars with little to no oversight didn't help.

A lot of this PPP money was handed to businesses that didn't need it. I personally know of a business that received almost 5 million dollars of PPP money and never really shut down during the lockdowns. Interestingly, the owner of this business bought all their manager's Rolex watches that same year.
Satellites can only spend a couple of minutes over a target because they're moving at 17,500mph, and they're generally hundreds of miles up at least in order to avoid the worst of atmospheric drag. The truss and boom on this balloon was larger than anything in orbit except ISS, and being at 12 miles altitude while moving at a couple hundred miles an hour means it could stay over a target area for an hour or more and gather a whole lot more intel than any spy satellite.
> Officials have said the debris field is approximately the size of 15 football fields by 15 football fields and that the balloon had propellers and a rudder.

Those balloons fly at 20km. Lowest satellite ever was stabilized at 164km high, but most spy satellites are twice that height. This x16 difference means you can skip on high end camera, and use something much cheaper. And the cost of launch (balloon vs rocket) is night and day as well. Not to mention if you can land it in international water, you can actually salvage it back. This could be cost effective over satellite, or an alternative to satellite.

There is also radio wave that bounce at 100km on the ionosphere. Flying under it might make it easier to pick up certain signal, but who knows what they had on that balloons.
Florian Philippot is fortunately a 100% irrelevant politician as of 2022. He left / was pushed out of the National Front after the 2017 elections and then founded his own party Les Patriotes which advocates leaving the European Union, the Schengen agreements, the European Convention on Human Rights and NATO, and he's become a covid antivaxxer shamelessly spouting fake news and nonsense pandering to conspiracy-minded people from day 1 since the beginning of the pandemic.
Not that the National Rally is any better regarding Russia though: Le Pen and the party have been indirectly funded by Russia since at least April 2014 through a Russian-owned Cypriot bank and then a loan from the First Czech-Russian Bank the same year. Also before the latest Presidential election a former conservative MP Thierry Mariani joined the National Rally and led the 2022 media campaign for Le Pen, and that guy is a notorious Putin and Assad stooge, who's visited Bachar El Assad, Russian-annexed Crimea where he met Putin, and . Le Pen herself said in April that she supported the help to Ukraine but she, Bardella and other high-ranking party members keep opposing financial sanctions on the grounds that it supposedly hurts the French people and economy without affecting Russia.

The French far-right have been in bed with Putin's regime for a decade because of an ideological alignment and corruption, but you can also find various shades of bothsidesism and relativism/complacency among part of the far-left / radical left as well as a few hardline conservatives who haven't jumped onto the National Rally's vessel yet.

I've recently read about Thierry Baudet mentioning the Reptilians, so I'd say we're not there yet, but yeah the guy has gone completely nuts and somewhat joined François Asselineau (UPR) in this niche. He recently supported Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, another right-wing sovereignist turned into a supporter of Didier Raoult and hydroxychloroquine during the pandemic.

And to say he graduated from prestigious elite schools (HEC & ENA) and used to be the vice-president of the National Front from 2012 to 2017, appearing everywhere on political TV sets during Hollande's Presidency until Le Pen's 2017 campaign. Now he's become a noxious Twitter fury and many of his tweets tread a thin line between dumb anti-everythingness and a denunciation of globalism/the hell of EU supranationalism/Bill Gates/whatever. He got 4.62% of votes during the latest parliamentary election in his own constituency in North-Eastern France, so rest assured he's slid into irrelevance and become nothing more than a background nuisance now. Hope it's the same with Baudet...

The guy is a certified conspiracy théorist, anti-vax and 100% pro Russia. He borders on promoting flat earth. Something like 0.1% at the latest poll. Just forget him, he´s a joke.

This is a lot like what I thought of Trump before he got elected. Don't underestimate him because you think he's a fool, that's what he wants you to think while he rallies followers.

Trump had money and a solid political sense. This guy has none. He went from being the second leader of the leading far right party (the national front) to almost nothing, by doing the wrong choices during the covid crisis, while the National front is still thriving (albeit under a new name). I am very wary of some far-right leaders, but not him.

Because there are "alternative facts" now, and you can't trust the media, unless the story has absolutely zero sources, aside from the original sources that had no proof whatsoever...like, "Fox news reporting, that Hannity reported, that Trump said something was 'fake news' and the alternative fact (a.k.a.- "The Truth") is COVFEFE" Then people have 3 "news" sources telling them "Well, it is definitely COVFEFE, for sure" And there's no point in fact-checking or correcting them, bc those people will never believe you...not if you don't speak "the truth" that they definitely know!

One of the weirdest things I’ve ever experienced was my next door neighbor claiming all sorts of wild shit, everything from him being a federal employee of a secret agency sent to Vegas to monitor…(something?$) to him shooting his own dog with a bean bag gun because he was “preparing for when it was poisoned.”.

>“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.".

That's what I mean. The pattern is ironic. It's totally misleading that they call themselves "the truth" and keep calling themselves that after the most famous Russian propaganda paper also called themselves that for decades when everyone knew it was all literal fake news. It's kind of like how Fox News will attach the "News" label to it's many opinion/infotainment shows to try to add legitimacy to the shows and then never back that up or claim it is clearly NOT news when they are questioned in court or when it actually could lead to consequences (except way worse since it's state sponsored propaganda).

If I understand correctly, they still had a presence on their website, which will now no longer be accessible in Germany/the EU. Their Youtube and TV presence already were banned.
And even if China manages to knock out the air defenses, what is going to stop new air defenses arriving overnight? China is going to have to put on the greatest and most precise missile display ever and then follow it up with an equally Amazing air campaign, naval campaign, and finally an invasion. All the while keeping up with a Logistics train that has never been seen before on this planet. Taiwan has 4000+ stinger missiles in addition to other varieties. An invasion through the air just isn't practical when 1 guy with a stinger can kill hundreds in a transport plane. Without full air supremacy, you can't stop resupply from the USA. To top it off, you now have to invade an island that has placed thousands of mines in the water on the coast and the entire beach. It also has tons of artillery trained precisely on the area an invasion force needs to land. All the while, your invasion ships will be under fire from artillery and anti-ship missiles. Once you land, you get to deal with Snipers and Tanks and other weapons that have been buried into the ground.
I think the US’s long game in Ukraine is to get China to sink themselves. They lose a lot of face by doing this, and all their trading partners are aware.

Then there's the matter of who the Republican nominee is. If it's Trump, then Republicans are not in a good position. A scenario where Democrats manage to retake the House and keep the Senate isn't that farfetched but now it's way too early to guess how things are going to pan out. In fact, given the last few election cycles, I'm not sure anyone can know for sure what's going to go down. In 2016, exit polling showed that Hillary was the likely winner and in 2022, exit polling showed that Democrats were in trouble.

Like someone else said, the GOP shot itself in the foot when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That lost them a lot of independents. It also energized younger voters.

What the hell. It’s not a big no no. It’s forgery on a federal document by a sitting member of Congress.
We are? Seems that my original point in reply to your comment was that it was republicans that overwhelmingly approve of business credits like the ERC and forgiven loans like the PPP, but immediately cry about expanded Child Tax Credits and how much they cost when in reality the CTC pales in comparison of costs. You replied that the expanded CTC wasn't popular. And yet, in the NYT article you used the author admits it was the fear of cuts to SS and Medicare that took priority for older Democrats. Who is advocating cuts to SS and Medicare? So, in my opinion, had republicans not demonized the expanded CTC as unaffordable like they always do the public approval of the expanded CTC would be high enough to necessitate inclusion in the spending bill. Republicans are the force moving against it because any Democratic policy that helps voters makes republicans look bad and they just can't have that. The expanded CTC has public support, what it doesn't have is bipartisan support. Because business tax credits>CTC./s.
But of course Republicans got the cuts to the IRS they asked for. Strategically zeroing out the technology upgrade budget, kneecapping any improved enforcement initiatives.

This wasn't "tyranny of the minority", it was a program that people didn't want to extend/make permanent so politicians focused on other priorities.
Their book taught them that women are cattle and non believers should be killed when the time is right - how on earth could they ever respect other people more or equal to it?
There’s actually a lot of good stuff in the Quran, especially for the time period it was written in. The problem is that it’s a religious book, and those always have fucked up bad shit alongside the good so it’s basically a net neutral. That, and like most religious books it was written over a thousand years ago, and none of them are really fully compatible with modernity.

The problem, and spoiler alert ahead, is that you shouldn't need someone or something to tell you how to be a good person or what is right. It's just common sense; don't be an asshole. If you do need to be told, then you're the problem. How hard is it to not be an asshole and control others?

Believe me we’re in the same side. I think religion is stupid but we still have to live alongside religious people so let’s at least try to see things accurately. Believing in a magical sky man that will punish you if you don’t love him is ducking dumb, but what can you do?

Before those religions existed, there were normal people who didn't kill each other and murderers, that were cast out of society. With those books, people assume that only the book made them not murder each other. There's no benefit to it. But we DID see the powerful religious leaders abuse the power to kill people. Look how even today people are executed in iran and call it a net neutral.

Go read it if you don’t believe me. It’s a mixed bag and I personally think all religions are dumb and not true. But I don’t think I’ve ever heard Andrew tate say something good. Just because the only muslims you ever listen to are the red necks of the Muslim world doesn’t mean they’re the only ones out there. It would be like judging all Christians by the southern baptists.

Guy if you think that people weren’t doing the same shit before organized religion then I don’t know what to tell you. And I’m saying this as someone that mostly thinks organized religion has hurt humanity more than it has helped.

But there are religious charities, and there are people who live a more moral life because of their faith. Do I think they need their faith to live a moral life? Absolutely not. Do I think there’s an inherent link between morality and religion? No. The morality is inherent to humanity, as is the propensity to exploit power structures like is done through religion. It’s all human shit, religion is just one of the masks we wear when we express our human nature, both good and bad.
That's what it is. It isn't modern equipment being funneled from china. Like oc is implying. They have huge stockpiles of older arms, because they haven't been used in decades.
According to the article, the US is accusing NK of supplying Russia with artillery shells. NK has thousands of artillery pieces pointed at Seoul, and puts a lot of funding into their military at the expense of their own people. I wouldn't put it past them selling or trading artillery shells, especially if it's older stock.

If i remember correctly they already found some dumps/stockpiles with them and they had Chinese writing.(hence the "chinese is supplying russia rhetoric") but it wouldn't be something China has stock of, cause its from decades ago and hasn't been used by china for a while. Just like USA doesn't keep stockpiles of old outdated, discontinued ammunition.

I wonder how the duties of AoC and Capitol Police intersect. Chief Sund announced his resignation 1 day after the Jan 6 incident and resigned a few days later. It should be noted that one officer of the Capitol Police died Jan 6 during the incident and many others were injured.

For those unfamiliar, the "Architect of the Capitol" (AOC) is a job something like the superintendent of the US Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol, all the Congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, and a few other random government buildings in the neighborhood.

We shifted because the people who were silent for the last 2 years all of a sudden have an opinion and are taking a position.

Thing is I am not going to argue these points. The idea that people who were silent for 2 years and backed up a person who took secrets and the lied about having them really have no say in someone who had a right to the docs in the beginning and when discovered them immediately called in the DoJ.

Better than the guy who took 350 docs on the way out and put them in a pool storage room off the main access corridor from the pool and ball room where they hold weddings and events for hundreds at a time.
Because fascism is a dictatorial regime in which a person came to power illegally, obtained full powers and has a monopoly on the press and the media. There is therefore only one party and it is illegal to have political opposition and a thought that is opposed to those of the dictator. There is the exaltation of war, violence and race. Although it is a far-right government, if you call it a fascist government you should open some history books.
Although I didn't vote for her, you have to point out that that party was the one that transformed an autocratic party into a democratic one and that helped the formation of the current republic that has always condemned dictatorial regimes. Biden's party is that of the KKK but no one says it's in their DNA.

There were differences between Southern and non-Southern Democrats back in the day when most white Southerners voted for Democrats. You could try to trot out the argument that Woodrow Wilson was at least KKK-friendly, but he was born and shaped in Virginia.

Prosperity and evangelical megachurches have been on the rise in the US with some acting like the Walmart of religion, moving into towns and drawing the people to their spectacle and away from the smaller community churches. These organizations are overtly political, have enormous piles of cash, and are making up an ever increasing number of the church participation amounts in the country.

If christians don't want their religion to be obsolete they need to depoliticize it. I know lots of people who used to go to church because they wanted to hear about Jesus and stopped going because they were tired of hearing about how they should vote republican.

It's strange because I have gone to many churches and attended many masses in my lifetime. I have never heard a priest/preacher/head figure ever make a sermon or have a homily in which politics is brought up. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, I'm sure it does, I've just never personally experienced it.

Small churches can still be politicized but these evangelical churches are taking shit to a ridiculous degree and on an increasing scale.

But, with all that being said, religious/faith oriented individuals and organizations in general donate more money and help others less fortunate on a scale that is rarely reported on. Faith as a whole def has an image problem, but it can be used for good and to benefit society.

Religious practice links us in webs of mutual knowledge, responsibility, and support like no other influence. Seven out of ten weekly church attenders told Pew they consider “work to help the needy” an “essential part” of their faith. Most of them put their money and time where their mouth is: 65 percent of weekly church attenders were found to have donated either volunteer hours or money or goods to the poor within the previous week.
If not fighting for the North you mean fighting for the South then yes. You understand what a war-time economy means? Basically everyone was involved in things that directly contributed towards the war. If you lived in the South and grew cotton that you sold to the Confederacy you were complicit. That's a simple ass concept so I don't know why we need to hash that out? Not to mention the war didn't start to eradicate slavery but it was started to stop the spread. Plenty of Northerners were slave holders. Pro Union doesn't equal anti-slavery.
More or less. Most of its growth was to a "phisiologyical" right who wouldn't hesitate in selling their ideologies for a few government resources directed towards their respective electoral areas.

Solar, wind, EVs, chips and phones. US fell behind our lost major advantages on a whole lot under the last administration when it came to technological advancements.
In fairness, China had completely bought the PV market and corrupted it for personal gain. Obama's refusal to confront them on this is a big reason why Trump won. It's still holding the PV industry back because many voters just don't trust a technology associated with China and economic divestment. Biden has already admitted this is a problem which is where many of his tarriffs come from.

Fair (I'm not young to drive into political analysis for win/loss). Although South Korea and US were still pretty big players in 2010-2016+. Almost all of those companies have had to shut down. Even LG gave up. If us had properly incentivized the industry, we would have both higher quality and better support. China had the incentive to invest in it as well because of its lack of other fuel sources. There was no reason for US to lose on the Li-FePO4 batteries. Trumps approach to creating trade wars by muscling into tariffs wasn't very effective either. Let's see how this one goes. Biden seems promising in the sense that he is looking at it from a standpoint of incentivizing and using tariffs to bring industry back to the US rather than going to a war over trade. Time will tell.

Maybe from an outside perspective. Within the US, the BIRA (lol?) flushed Obama-era projects with money. Notable winners are California's high speed rail project, Chicago's Metra, Amtrak, and Virginia. Biden's decades-long plan to expand Amtrak's eastern corridor with a Southeast Corridor from DC to Charlotte is now formally happening and is no longer opposed by Republicans. Biden is rebuilding our nuclear capacity, and by the end of the decade we'll have the ability to build and fuel nuclear reactors without Russia. Same for space rockets.

Trump was just a single speed bump. There's a much larger paralysis spawning from a much bigger, worse infection within the US government. The American right has finally faced it's moment where it needs to show voters things it can make. It can't, and it's in steep decline as a result. Just look at how Newt Gringrich has had to pull a 180 on NASA because, thanks to Putin being evil, Russia had more civil rockets than us.
Lastly, it all creates an undefined, invisible fear. The person sitting next to you could be a pervert and you'd never know! It creates suspicion of the general public and within social groups. This fear is exploited and used to create more laws, which then creates more confusion and more separate social spheres, resulting in more fears, etc, in a loop.
It is a small minority that is not very powerful and even a lot of other minorities are willing to sell them out for the time being.

Plus there's the "bonus" of being able to link trans individuals and drag performers together, making it two-for-one propaganda deal, and insinuating that trans individuals are choosing to dress up just like drag performers, thus eliminating their identity and making the laws appear "not so bad" to the public.
Seriously. A particular dumbass and her husband I know (and both I loathe, but fortunately don’t have to be around anymore) live in Simi Valley and all they do is complain about Democrats and bought a gun because - and I’m not joking - they need to protect themselves from the roving BLM gangs they think are Mad Maxing it up around here and are gonna come for them. They’ve 110% dropped the “If you don’t like America, then leave!” line when I/we have complained about Trump, etc. They’ve spent years bitching about this state even though they live comfortably, have literally nothing to suffer for (financially well off, white, etc.) and keep saying they wanna leave and they perpetually go to Tennessee and other red states “looking for a home.”.

You mean he reluctantly agreed to do what the house, senate and infectious disease experts were begging him to do a month earlier. All he literally did was sign a executive order declaring a emergency to allow the house the funds to help the pharmaceutical companies to rush the vaccine. Literally any president would have done the same but likely earlier. The fact that he takes credit is hilarious.

I'm betting it's that the voters don't care. They want her to claim she lost by fraud so that she can win, not because they believe she lost by fraud, but because winning is better than losing. Moving on to running again in the same democratic system that "defrauded" her the last time is consistent with a belief-free ideology. This is the simplest explanation.

They used to be huge and collapsed. They are the only bank in South Korea to have working relationships ships with North Korea. If you ever did business in South Korea you would know there are a ton of large banks to use and you never see Daewoo anywhere. There is no reason to get a loan from Daewoo of all the banks in South Korea. On top of that, Trump never disclosed the loan.
He had an 18 million dollar loan from Daewoo which does business w North Korea. I wonder why Trump spent more time with Kim Jung Un than he did with all NATO leaders combined.

Gaining seats in the senate is a bit historic. In the last 60 years it's only happened a handful of times. In most mid term cycles the party controlling the White Houses lost Congress entirely and lost seats in the Senate as well (50-50 splits are pretty rare during a Presidential election year, normally you only see those splits after seats are lost in the following midterm). If, and it is still a long shot no doubt about it, Dems actually keep the House as well, then that will only be the third time in 42 years, and Carter was President then. That's why people dumped on Trump pretty hard for losing both during his midterm cycle, because it usually doesn't happen that way. Dems losing the House is just par for the course, but Republicans retaking it by only a seat or two? That's unheard of.
What has Jeffries done to be the heir apparent? Aside from being a POC and a “making history” pick. He’s never been the 2nd top official, hasn’t shown an ability to bring together moderates and progressives.

Given the country's divided and toxic political culture, it is easy to forget or not sufficiently appreciate all of the good that the country does, the good in the government, and the good in the American people. One should be able to celebrate that and still advocate for something even better.

I agree with you in principal about both biden and trump, and also that reddit is not the outside world. I also agree that anyone in reality with a shred of common sense would see the logic that the law should apply equally to both. But if you think that the majority of trump supporters in the outside world in general agree with this, then you and I are going to have the first serious disagreement disagreement of our nascent online friendship .
No, it was a Sidewinder. There’s a good article on The Drive’s ‘The War zone’ page where they talk about the problems. Machine guns are worse than useless in this context because the bullets will probably make small holes so the balloon would take a very long time to deflate but they’ll also have to land somewhere, which is problematic if there are people down range.
I'm curious what they did to the missile, if anything, to make it more useful in this context. The balloon would probably not have been solid enough for a radar proximity fuse to trigger, nor for a contact fuse. So what did they do to ensure the missile didn't just fly straight through making only a small hole?

Back in the 80's, the airforce put a kinetic missile onto an f-15 to shoot a satellite. The service ceiling of the eagle is 80k feet. Without the explosive warhead, you can cram more fuel into the missile. Works well against satellites. They used the same kind of missile. You have to remember that missiles of that size are moving faster than mach 3.
Blue ID card means Israeli perminent resident and permission to go anywhere in Israel. It is very common practice (though not actually back up in law) that in low security checkpoints (like army checkpoints within the west bank) that most security personnel will let you by without a check if you flash a blue ID card as opposed to the Palestinian green ID card. It means they can work and live in Israel like any Israeli and generally really have equal rights (the right to vote requires citizenship, not just permanent residence, so a blue ID doesn't necessarily mean that they get to vote).
The Palestinian Authority administrates area A and B, while Israel manages COGAT, and also prevents the area from turning into yet another jihad terrorist shithole (like Gaza).

Hey everyone! My name is Andrey Pertsev and I’m a Russian journalist with Meduza. My work also appears in Carnegie Russia and Riddle. I’m best known for having sources throughout the Russian government, and understanding the political machinations of the Russian Federation. I’m from Arkhangelsk, but I’ve been to a majority of Russia’s regions and know their political structures well.
On January 26th, Meduza was outlawed in Russia. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office designated Meduza as an illegal, “undesirable organization.” Officials announced in a public statement that Meduza’s activities “pose a threat to the foundations of the Russian Federation’s constitutional order and national security.” That means we’re banned from operating on Russian territory under threat of felony prosecution and any Russian citizens who “participate in Meduza’s activities” also could also face legal repercussions. Me, for example.

The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office designated Meduza as an illegal, “undesirable organization.” Officials announced in a public statement that Meduza’s activities “pose a threat to the foundations of the Russian Federation’s constitutional order and national security.” That means we’re banned from operating on Russian territory under threat of felony prosecution and any Russian citizens who “participate in Meduza’s activities” also could also face legal repercussions. Me, for example.
That's very interesting. I'm a little surprised they weren't at least somewhat prepared for this. They knew Biden was going to Poland and "surprise" visits to Ukraine from world leaders have been a thing for nearly a year now.

Underestimating the resolve and courage of the west is one of the key mistakes they keep making. The FSB probably told decision makers that Biden would be too afraid, because it makes them feel fuzzy.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all of your questions everyone Unfortunately, we have to go, but maybe we’ll get a chance to answer a few more tomorrow before Putin’s speech. If you want to follow along for said speech, we will be doing a live blog on our site. Have a nice day.

Yes the honestly think that people from "the west" are huge pussies. It's sort of weird because they don't understand that "speaking softly" doesn't mean you aren't carrying a big stick.

The USA told the Kremlin at the very last moment, and so my sources in state media said that they didn’t receive instructions on how to cover it for a while. That means the Kremlin didn’t know exactly how to react. It’s likely that Putin and his inner circle are in the process of rewriting his speech to the parliament tomorrow.

Honestly most people are ego centric when it comes to assessing others actions and motivations. 💯 this was Putin thinking of the coin were flipped, he wouldn’t.

Why oh why do they say shit like this? So then he goes, and Biden looks tough and it looks like Kyiv is under control and in no danger from the Russians.

Putin’s elites are used to existing with Putin in the role of “arbiter,” but there’s no other such “arbiter” among them. Therefore, a conflict between different groups would be quite likely.

One way or another, yes. People spend more money on groceries, can't buy appliances, and so on. But often they think that the West is punishing them. Of course, if you tell them about getting rid of sanctions truthfully, they will gladly want to get rid of them. At least quite a few of them will.

You can tell from his appearance that he is not feeling well. He often has trouble moving one arm, his legs shake. He stammers in his speeches. The media has reported that Putin might have cancer. I’ve heard that, too.

Awareness comes when people see the truth and coping mechanisms can no longer resist it. We manage to reach a significant part of the Internet audience, but the older generation still watches TV and reads pro-government tabloids. Making predictions about what will happen after Putin is a thankless task. But I can say that in regional elections in Russia people very often vote for opposition candidates who offer solutions to economic problems rather than “the greatness of Russia.” Democracy in Russia is quite possible!

There are two points of view - according to one (and it seems to be confirmed by official sociological surveys) Russians support the war and Putin. According to the other, the majority of citizens do not support the war, but are afraid to answer honestly to pro-government sociologists. The truth is out there. Most likely, the share of support for the war is much lower than official sociological data - people are really afraid to speak honestly, there are criminal penalties for “discrediting the army” in Russia. According to the indirect results of independent researchers who do not ask directly, we can judge that support for the war specifically is not so high - people are tired of the news about the war, they would like peace negotiations (especially if Putin initiated them). Young Russians, as a rule, are against the war. There is an apathetic part of society, which continues to live as if nothing has happened - the war disturbs it. They don’t want to go to the front - according to polls, the level of anxiety in Russian society exceeds the level of calm. Moreover, anxiety arises at moments when new rumors of mobilization arise. Finally, there is indeed a large segment of society that supports the war: these are people who watch television and consider themselves supporters of the authorities. But again, in this group we can identify another subgroup - Russians who seriously think that this is a “special operation” and that the Russian army is fighting the Nazis. They are victims of propaganda. Thus, Russian society is very heterogeneous in its support for the war, although it should not be downplayed.

There are difficulties, sources gradually sift themselves out. I weed out false sources myself. But now there is another problem - the Kremlin does not control the situation, especially in the war, and it has to adjust to that reality. That is why its plans are increasingly collapsing.

I’m not sure anyone can answer that question. First of all, because until the war began the Kremlin managed the situation itself where it could and tried not to act directly where it wasn’t in control. Now Putin is not in control of the situation, he is clearly not able to put even part of his plans into practice. Predicting his behavior under such conditions is very difficult, as is predicting the behavior of the Russian elite. We thought they were stronger and more reasonable than they turned out to be. But maybe they will turn out not to be so weak?

Putin has been acting quite impulsively of late, and this cannot be completely ruled out. But he is focused on China, and the leadership in Beijing is unlikely to want nuclear escalation.

There is a very strong gap between the audience of the free Internet and the audience of propaganda. By the way, on the Internet there are staunch supporters of the invasion, of Putin, and so on. But we are talking about the phenomena in general. What makes Russia different from China is that it does not yet have a video-hosting service that can compete with YouTube. Many have learned to use VPNs. And that approach has a rich tradition: back in Soviet times, people listened to so-called “enemy voices” on the radio (BBC, Radio Liberty, Voice of America, etc…).

In Russia, according to the Constitution, the Prime Minister would act as President. I think well of Navalny - I think he is a strong man and a good politician.

Thank you The TV really looks at you in Russia – in the store, in the cafe, and so on. You can’t get away from it, it will get you everywhere. Corruption is what has degraded Putin and his entourage, which is why they started the war, thinking that Europe and the U.S. would not benefit from stopping them. One small consolation: corruption has led to the deplorable state of the Russian army. Isn’t that useful.

After the outbreak of war, there is no question of any soft power. On the contrary, undesirable artists are banned in Russia itself.

This happened before the war started, because Russia had already imposed counter-sanctions on food products from Europe and the United States. Agribusiness became really profitable, but now it has problems with fodder, breeding animals, and seeds. In addition, the purchasing power of Russians is falling. There is no benefit in terms of the economy from the war.

The budget is definitely in deficit and a very serious one at that. Military expenditures and the loss of hydrocarbon markets are having an impact. But it is better to read other authors from Meduza, or Alexandra Prokopenko from Carnegie.

In the 1990s, Russia existed managed to exist under a not very strong or tough leader. The experience is there. The connection between the regions is economically established, and it is difficult to imagine them breaking away from one another. With reasonable federal leadership and serious powers in the regions, Russia will remain whole.

Question: “Does the Russian opposition and the remainder its free press recognize that there is a possibility of Russia’s disintegration as a result of this war? Would such a scenario be acceptable for the people in Moscow and in St.-Pétersbourg, in your opinion? If not, what is a realistic acceptable endspiel?”.

Of course I don’t support the war. If you mean Russian society’s opinion on the war, you can see one of my answers below.
In my opinion - It's too late. This also isn't a matter of us doing it to ourselves. Foreign adversaries have created this mess with a lot of useful idiots and blackmailable officials. There's no 4-D chess being played here our country is on it's way to being rotten to it's core if it isn't there already. The attacks from extremists on critical infrastructure will continue, and our intelligence apparatus will fail us, just like how it did on J6th. We're in free-fall, and the ruling classes attempts at smash and grab white collar robbery and political debauchery are a only symptoms of this.

The only proposal that has a vague chance of being accepted would be return to pre-war borders, recognition of Crimea as Russian, and some kind of non-NATO security guarantee for Ukraine, plus substantial reparations from Russia. Gets Russia out of Ukraine and leaves Ukraine no worse off geopolitically since getting Crimea back or joining NATO were unrealistic goals for Ukraine anyway. Allows Putin to present it as a 'win' since they 'stopped' NATO expansion and won Crimea and he can frame reparations as being generous Russian aid. Will help reduce Russian nationalist paranoia about NATO Russia's power declone and will limit the possibility of future Russian aggression since China will have a strong incentive to pressure Russia to stick to their peace plan. Hopefully it will last until the Russian cold war nationalist generation dies out in politics.
you forgot the part about keeping Ukraine (and other posr soviet countries) out of NATO and the super fineprint on letting iran and nk have nukes.... so they can have (so call take back) land that dont belong to them...

To be fair this could work in Ukraine's favour. China really doesn't like the idea of legitimizing territorial separatism as much as they want to support Russia.

It reminds me of the time that Obama agreed to take live questions from congressional Republicans. Fox News promoted it for weeks thinking that Obama was cornered and that they were going to get enough gotcha soundbites to play back for the rest of his term. Instead, after about a half hour or so of Obama deftly dismantling every single Republican talking point they cut away for some absolutely irrelevant bullshit as MSNBC giddily continued with live coverage.

We can help some. In 2023 there will be local and state elections. Vote out as many right wingers and Republicans as we can. From the school board to the white house every election matters. Every seat we take from the right and the GOP is one less way for them to use our tax money and the powers of that seat to advance their plan for minority rule.

Yeah, these steps could have prevented this situation with Southwest, but this letter was sent back in June, so it's not like Sanders could have predicted everything that happened in December. The fact that Buttigieg was warned the airlines were falling apart months ago and didn't do any of these suggestions or really anything else to improve the situation is why people are so pissed off at him.

Ukraine was not about to join NATO in 2022, nor in 2014. In 2013 Ukraine was a very politically divided country and Pro-Russian interests were only able to win elections with a mixture of populism, support for federalization, and even a bit of compromise with some Pro-western politicians while extrajudicially persecuting others. Russia chose to escalate that turmoil into a Ukrainian civil war and when it was clear that their side would lose, they intervened to force a stalemate. Seven years later they came to finish the job. Claiming that the EU association agreement that started all of this was tantamount to American nukes being stationed in Kharkiv is comical and you know it. Russia is insecure over its lost prestige, it is NOT under threat from attack from anywhere. If Russia was genuinely terrified about NATO invading they wouldn’t be gutting their military capabilities to fight Ukrainians. They can’t stand to see Ukraine align itself with the west due to their own pride and sense of entitlement over its land and people. Ukraine was never going to invade Russia and neither was NATO.
Since when did a tyrant ever ask permission of his people to brutalize anyone. Only , maybe, if they believe for sure they will lose the next fair election but we hv seen how that plays out.
The serious health risk of CV19 risk to younger people in peak physical condition is minimal however, there are some studies that suggest there is a slightly elevated risk of vaccine side effects in this group. The efficacy of this vaccine wanes within months of taking it, there are no long term studies on its effects. I think it’s safe but because everyone’s health history is different, I don’t feel it should be mandatory i.e., Epstein Barr. These are some of the reasons I don’t think it should be mandatory. It’s okay if you disagree but I do know someone that faced complications.

A redditor a lot smarter than me once commented something along the lines of, putin is foremost a political animal because he was former KGB a spy he’s not a military strategist in the sense of like a general who wants to go around in battle it would be something he would have complete and total advantage over it that’s what he would want if you want political gain that’s why he does the false voting thing is no reason for that if he’s just a general just send in his forces too kill everyone instead that’s why he wants to be so loved and seen as a strong man.it’s like how is he gonna be able to keep this image while still facing reality.
Even if Russia used a nuke (assuming it's been maintaining them this entire time which is a dubious assumption), there's no reason at this point for US/NATO to respond in kind. US/NATO could win a conventional war against a nuclear Russia.

There was that one flight attendant who survived a bombing when she was sucked out of the plane and landed in the snow. Sole survivor I believe. Though I don't think she was in fighting shape.

Great question and smart of you to ask. There is no opportunity back in Russia, so I’m hoping someone is putting together a plan for them. Traditionally I would say this has happened dozens of times through history. By now we should easily have enough historical data on human nature to come up with something a little more proactive than just waiting to see.

So the big picture you have to ask yourself is why would the guy NOT tell his minister of defense, head of intelligence and entire chain of command that they were going to invade?

The ultimate lesson that Ukraine taught the world is that freedom is the strongest drug there is. Once you have tasted it, you aren’t going back to slavery feeding a machine that eats you.

It just isn’t realistic to anyone that has experienced it. A whole lot of politicians are going to have to understand this because Ukraine isn’t stopping until the threat is neutralized. They have survived everything thrown at them. Now thriving is the only option left.

There is no easy way out of this for Russia. The entire invasion was predicated on lies. And just like any child of a toxic relationship can tell you, there is a lot of mental baggage to unpack before any real progress can be made.

The first step is always education. When you get a mass exodus of people out of a highly propaganda managed state, there is always some latent psychology that needs to be addressed before they can break the cycle. It’s a fairly recurring there on the North Korean border that defectors have a hard time adjusting to the speed of motion in south korea. Many will go back. Psychologically it’s probably no different than an abusive relationship. Toxic..but familiar.
How can you say that there’s no geopolitical impact to picking sides anymore? How can you make such an absurd statement? Let’s take an example here: India makes a statement that India+China+Russia+OPEC is coming in a group. Will there be no geopolitical changes? Will US ignore such a grouping? Will USA not plan ahead and be terrified because of the world’s major countries and maximum population of this world coming combined in a group? And you also said that India has no negotiating power. Dear, then why was Joe Biden saluting to Narendra Modi in the recent G20 Summit? Because he knows how India is vital for the international relations. India will surpass China in terms of population in coming years being the demographic dividend the key feature, which will give rise a huge market.You can’t be insane to mess with India because India holds the future. Because if it’s strategic location + Population + Democracy + relations with other countries. Choose your words carefully before making any supreme statements.
Most countries hedge their bets, trying not to overly support one great power over the other. The world isn't divided into two cold war camps anymore.
SpaceX's next project Starship of course has a reusable first AND second stage so is 100% reusable. But of course the feasibility of this is as yet unproven.
says who ? And for deep space flight ? You sure about that ? Because last time i checked reusability dosnt make economic or Engineering sense if you want to go past Earths orbit because your first stage needs to be absolutly massiv to come back from those Velocities and angles.

Reusability does, of course, require larger rockets. But the cost of fuel is such a miniscule part of the cost of launching that it still makes economic sense.

If Republicans have any grand plans for the national economy they should probably let their state governors know first. The UN has openly said that parts of Alabama resemble the developing world, which is shocking since they are in the richest country in world history.

Also if you look up the states most dependent on federal funding (meaning funding received compared to taxes paid) the top 10 is DOMINATED by Republican states. The reddest of the red too…Mississippi, Alabama, Montana, Louisiana, Alaska, Idaho all in the top 10. Funny to me that the people who hate government assistance the most rely on it the most.

that's the point of this communication. The next Ukrainian (offensive) move that makes sense is to take back Crimea through a southern offensive. The fewer Russian assets are located on the peninsula, the better. Give them as many reasons as possible to withdraw.
Typically yes, not letting your enemy capture a bridge is a big deal because then you can stop their advance. But there's no way Ukraine is going to push through Crimea into Russia. They would quickly start to lose the moral high ground and international support.

dude, if russia doesn't demolish it the minute the Ukrainians enter Mariupol, as in shelling range - they would be dumber than what they have shown already.

From Russia's point of view it would seem to make more sense to leave it intact. Blowing up your own bridge would be an admission that they are losing and are not planning to regain control anytime soon.

Ukraine has reason to let it live for now. Let it live until they push into Crimea so the Russians have a way out. Sure it means the troops can be used to re-enforce Russian lines elsewhere but you generally dont want to leave an enemy no escape route unless your plan is to literally eliminate them.

the symbolism of the bridge being demolished by ATACMS and ceasars would be far more humiliating then blowing it up on their own. a false flag that kills civilians in fact might help them since the bridge was going to be destroyed regardless.

If the Russians are really planning an offensive then it's just much better to sit behind your defenses and let them rush across the open fields instead of attacking yourself.
KYIV, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The head of Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy firm said on Sunday there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they seized in March soon after their invasion.
Such a move would be a major battlefield change in the partially-occupied southeastern Zaporizhzhia region where the front line has hardly shifted for months. Repeated shelling around the plant has spurred fears of a nuclear catastrophe.

"Firstly, there are a very large number of reports in Russian media that it would be worth vacating the (plant) and maybe worth handing control (of it) to the (International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA)," he said, referring to the United Nations nuclear watchdog. "One gets the impression they're packing their bags and stealing everything they can.".

Russia and Ukraine, which was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in Chornobyl in 1986, have for months repeatedly accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia reactor complex, which is no longer generating energy.

Why on earth would you want undisciplined Russian forces to take nuclear material with them? They can't be trusted to not commit warcrimes even with normal bullets, let alone whatever they would try to do if they could stuff a uranium pellet into a pile of explosives to revenge-contaminate the area.

I'm worried about what they've done that we do not know about and what they will do on the way out. It is distressing to hear agencies telling the world that they were not given access to certain areas of the plant by Russian forces.
Ok so I swear to god it was on his Wikipedia page for years, but after googling it to show you a source I can’t find one. Apparently he did date Laura Ingraham though, but I know almost nothing about her while I’m very familiar with Coulter, and I’m guessing that whoever had initially written that Wikipedia entry got the two confused. Sorry for the misinformation! He did date an insane blonde conservative, just not the one I thought.

A S-300 was found at the scene (), but it's a missile that both Ukraine and Russia use. It's also a missile that the vast majority have been made in Russia/Soviet Union (hence the Polish Foreign Ministry's "Russian-made"). Russia's been repurposing them as ground attack missiles (seen in Kharkiv - ) and Ukraine has been shooting Russian strikes down with S-300s as well.

This is NOT the start of WW3, folks. Calm. However, Poland has a lot of options to make things incredibly unpleasant for Russia without kicking off WW3 if it's confirmed Russia was the source of the missile.

Just to make things clear, making a serious no fly zone declaration is basically the same as sending NATO troops into Ukraine to enforce a no soldier/tank zone.

Curiously in 2003, Russia was part of a letter by a joint delegation of countries that condemned the Holodomyr and stated that it was responsible for 7-10 million deaths. "In the former Soviet Union millions of men, women and children fell victims to the cruel actions and policies of the totalitarian regime". It stops short of calling it genocide but makes it clear that the famine was the result of policy.
Yeah, but the point is that they did not condemn the fact, that Stalin used the hunger to eradicate Ukrainian culture and nationalism, by selling most of the ukranian grain to the world market and forbidding anyone to leave the Ukranian Soviet Republic. There were several policies that targeted ethnical Ukranians, which resulted in them being much more affected by hunger death than ethnical Russians inside Ukraine. It was genocide.

Putin leverages power using the oligarchs that act as mafia kingpins to keep himself afloat. They in turn benefit from his corrupt policies in a symbiotic relationship. Without his “kingpins” he doesn’t have control of the Russian population.

It’s all fun and games until you realize the conflict is dragging into its 2nd year and EU countries are still doing business with Russia: If the EU ceased all trade with Russia and jailed/ executed the oligarchs from his inner circle when they venture overseas, then the war would end within a month.

The taxes are used to fulfill the constitutional requirement to educate children. Giving away money to random third parties doesn't help solve that problem because those schools by necessity will cost more and have a profit motive rather than being directly dedicated to education. Besides that, since they're not required to take all children, they will necessarily require there to be two school systems funded by taxes, the private one and the public one which takes all the kids the private schools don't want to take. Does paying twice for the same education make sense financially to you? Nope.

This is the reason the US refuses to give Ukraine ATACMS (very long range precision missiles that can be launched through the HIMARS platforms and hit inside Russia proper), due to the fear of escalating to nuclear weapons retaliation by Russia, in fact it was just revealed this week that the US somehow (not detailed yet) blocked the HIMARS platforms they sent from even being able to launch these missiles (as if they could have gotten them from elsewhere XD) so even if they did send them, unless it was a software update/flip of switch, they wouldn't be able to use them.
The stunningly idiotic Russian take is not that Ukrainians can't physically (due to lack of ability) attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine....it's the stated position that it is MORALLY WRONG for Ukraine to attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine. It is astounding. "Don't you DARE attack our missile launching jets that we are using to wreck you mutherfuckers, your mothers, your children, your schools and hospitals. You are morally obligated to let us kill you.".
Eighter that, or he's pretty much dead. Taking down (and what's more important - humiliating) a dark-net marketplace can piss a lot of people.

I am pretty surprised he was willing to share a town he lives in, especially since he is a foreigner, which makes him even easier to find - I don't suppose there's that many Ukranian cybersecurity experts in Wisconsin, who left UA in the 80s. Hell, I don't even think there's that many foreign Ukranian cybersecurity experts worldwide (I'm not implying that Ukranians shouldn't be good at cybersecurity, but that there's rather not that many good hackers worldwide). I'm pretty sure that it's probably a 27 y.o. woman living in Europe, or something like that. At least that what I'd do, if I ever released info like this - be vaguely specific about who I am while trying to appear carefull about my fake identity, so it's plausible.

On top of this, getting to Wisconsin, getting weapons, and getting out safely is likely to be a challenge.
Belarus has an army that hasn't fought anyone or really upgraded anything since the cold war, if even then. They have like 50k troops who've never seen a day in combat and a bunch of old Soviet shit that probably barely works because they've given all the good stuff to Russia.
Lukashenko is barely holding on to power and needed Russia to bail him out after the last election. The only thing keeping him in power is this army, and Russia's, which indirectly mean that he's beholden to them because there's nowhere else to turn to except for Russia. Compare that to Putin who has many PMC groups and militarized police forces that can be used to ensure that no one military faction can get strong enough to threaten him.

Meanwhile Ukraine has an estimated 1 million men in the army by now, most of which have been battle tested at some point, strong defensive lines and the latest western tech. They've also been fighting in the Donbass on rotation for almost a decade, so they have experience.

It doesn't take a genius to see that the Belarusian army probably made it quite clear that they have no interest in fighting that.

Belarus merely serves as a satellite state of Russia. Most Belarusians are aware of this and are increasingly vocal in their disapproval for it.

With Russia's military strenh all but exhausted, Lukashenko(presumably with Moscow's approval) has made the calculation that he may not be able to count upon their assistance in curbing any escalation in civil unrest caused by increasing Belarus' involvement in the war.

Ukraine started this war with 200k troops, with 400k reserves... Take away their loses of 100k, and you get 500k troops with prior military training.

The other 500k are all conscripts. The west is trying to help train these fresh troops, but not all of them have had time for proper formal training.

The total number of western trained troops only reaches about 15-20k troops so far. Not a significant enough number to change the war.

As for "the latest western tech" that's not even close to true. We've sent them older systems that we could spare. Older APC's, some advanced rocket artillery (Himars) and M777 artillery. There are no stealth fighter jets, and no significant amounts of advanced tanks.

The bayraktar drones have disappeared because they are useless when the Russians have proper Air defence setup, and we still haven't sent any of our more advanced drones either.

You can't on one hand attack Russia for using conscripts, without also recognizing that the majority of the Ukrainian army is also now conscripts/volunteers with no prior military training, or straight up reservists.

The west needs to be supplying tanks and fighter jets to give the Ukrainians any real chance of winning against Russia. Otherwise we're just waiting for another Afghanistan style disaster to take place with airlifts out of Kiev....

There is a huge difference between the two right now. First, the Ukrainian troops are volunteers. Ukraine has mobilized several times but hasn't had to actually force anyone to fight yet because they are more than willing to volunteer to fight for their country. The same is not true if Russia. We've all seen the videos of soldiers grabbing people off the street to conscript them or choosing minorities over Russians in a way that makes them know that they're expendable. The level of morale difference is huge.

Second, Ukraine started mobilizing right away in March and has access to very good trainers. Russia only mobilized recently and was actually sending military trainers and teachers to the front prior to that, which severely depleted their ability to train the conscripts. The fact that Russia, who has fought in a dozen wars in the past few decades is relying on Belarusian trainers, who have fought in zero, is not a good sign. Ukraine has a 6 month head start and much better trainers at their disposal. The two armies are nothing alike.

True, it was more a point on how bad the Belarusian stuff is. Remember, they've been giving lots of stuff to Russia so they probably don't have a lot of their best stuff anymore.

Here's an idea, don't go into a discussion accusing the other side of lying right of the bat. Especially when it's obvious that you just aren't informed on what you are talking about. It makes you look really bad.

Umm, are we watching the same war? Russia is getting pushed back on every front except the meat grinder which is Bakhmut. Ukraine liberated 400+ settlements in the past 3 months and Russia claimed 3. Russia is burning through equipment at an unsustainable rate and is having to buy extra stuff off of Iran and North Korea. Russian support for the war is lower than Ukrainian support for it. Russia failed to win in a surprise attack with their best troops and now has lost over 50% of the land that they held at their peak and are desperately throwing conscripts into the line to try to accomplish anything since last July.

I agree that Ukraine needs everything that we can give them, but if you think that Russia is winning and on the verge of over running the country then I don't even know what to say as you clearly aren't paying attention to what's going on.

You say tanks are obsolete, well then what have they been replaced with? Mass waves of infantry charging at heavily defended positions? Infantry can't carry a 125mm cannon with high explosive ammo that blows through entire buildings in a single shot.

Warfare is changing with tech. Tanks are being redesigned to accommodate that change, and from what I've read, are not going to be as integral to a fighting force as they once we're.

Russia has a sizeable presence in Belarus right now, probably for this exact reason and also to train Russian conscripts. Any protest at this point would get put down hard by Russia and they would probably end up conscripting the protestors.

They're probably waiting for the end of the war. If Russia is so beat up that it can't defend Lukashenko, that's when things will get wild.
This dispute is a good thing. The inflation reduction act is a massive investment in decarbonizing the U.S. economy with long term goals. As part of those investments many of the subsidies require materials to be sourced or produced within the US. This has made lots of eu companies interested in investing in the us to take advantage of those subsidies.
Eu leaders are worried that this will result in losses in domestic production. It’s not eu companies losing out that leaders are worried about, it’s eu workers. In a better world the eu would also pass a directive followed by national governments to match us domestic investments. Then we would get a boost everywhere in technology to decabonize around the western world.

It’s really not that weird that the us subsidies like this contain local production requirements. That is wildly common around the world.

The US can do what they want. And the EU can also do what they want. In this case the EU tells the US that they would respond with also protecting their own economy against American products.

However maybe the US reconsiders if they make an exception for the EU in return for the EU also not sanctioning American products. Would be beneficial for both sides. There are surprisingly few real democracies in the world. Maybe they should stick together. Otherwise the winner would be the dictatorships of the world.

It simply is a warning. The US can do what they want. Germany is simply warning the US that the EU will implement counter measures against the US. It is entirely up to the US if they want to do it anyway.
This government does not give a fuck about our people. Could you imagine the US government opening fire on the subway in the US? Or the British raining bullets on the Tube in London?
Worth noting the people who were beaten by the police were not protesters in that incident. There were tensions between pro-democratic group and pro-government group in one train, but the police ended up boarding another train and beat civilians there.

Exactly, the Hong Kong protest was ascendant when the police used violence liberally, and quickly died down once the police learned to put up a facade of restraint in public view, while more radical elements of the protestors turned violent.

With the amount of oil they control, they know no other government with high global standing will take meaningful action against them, especially not from within Europe whilst they're in the midst of an energy crisis. Tragically, the Iranian people are alone in their fight.

Yes but we're clearly overreacting when we say the government handed 15,000 prisoners death sentences.

This government does not give notice when they kill you. They just kill you. So when 227 out of 290 members of parliament say Iranians should be punished with the harshest means possible - a government that executed the second highest number of people in 2017-2020 in the world according to deathpenaltyinfo.org - yes it is effectively a mass death sentence.

The Islamic Republic's enemy is not the US or Israel, it is their own citizens. It always has been. It's why until this movement, everybody in my life or family, no matter where in the world we lived outside of Iran, was silent about this regime in public. Because they literally watch what those of us in the diaspora say. And none of us could ever return if we said anything openly critical of them.

But no more. If my people are out in the streets fighting and dying, the least I could do is talk about it and deliver their message. Fuck this regime. Fuck what they've done to our people. Fuck what they've done to our perception across the globe. Fuck them for getting rich while they beat the blood for the poor.

You are all now being exposed to their evil, perhaps the the first time. I've carried the pain of knowing their harm for my entire life in the diaspora. And I'm one of the lucky ones.

Thank you ♥️. This is the Iran my parents grew up in. It was by no means a utopia, they had problems just like any other country. But it was a live able country. A fun one to visit and one you could be proud to be from.

We Iranians are old, our culture has survived thousands of years. I really believe we can take our country back. My heart just breaks for all the brutality and lives lost until we get there.
Every major advancement of humanity led to a burst in growth. Agriculture alone boosted the numbers, so I'd say around when we started getting better at dealing with disease is where I feel the biggest burst is.
Gay people and the infertile are basically our ecosystems population control. We're the top of the food chain, we don't have predators to control our numbers. In nature plenty of times there's homosexual relationships in order for the local population to stay under control and not use up all the resources.

I thought about it and I have a hard time understanding the difference of someone being executed vs imprisoned for life w/o parole. People bring up cost, but executions aren't cheap either, especially when it can take decades to happen.

The past few years, I've had a shift in my feelings on capital punishment. It came from seeing other people who would get visibly upset if someone wasn't sentenced to death, or would cheer and celebrate if they were.

This is likely true but let’s not cast stones here since Democrats have spent considerable energy over the last six years or so investigating Trump without much to show for it. Since I am sure someone will bring up Russian collusion and the results of the Jan 6 committee…he is still completed his term (beat two impeachments by the way) and is still threatening to run for office again so to date none of that effort has produced much except cost for the taxpayer and pages of documents that half of the county doesn’t care about.

The fact that it opens up foreign influence seems increasingly destructive to national security. The once in a century instability in the house of representatives, I am sure some nations would pay good money for that.

But when push comes to shove, the vast majority of people here are decent, caring folk, and I think the noise makers are loud, but few in their ranks. But enough that we need to stay vigilant. I'm glad I got to vote for Brownley and help keep the seat with the party that wholly rejects the kind of bigoted and short-sighted thinking the Republicans continue to flirt with to court votes.

I'm glad I got to vote for Brownley and help keep the seat with the party that wholly rejects the kind of bigoted and short-sighted thinking the Republicans continue to flirt with to court votes.
I was just drawn into her district with the last census (previously was part of Ted Lieu's) but have lived around this area for 20 years; while there's always been a bit of a conservative streak in the area, it's much less an ideological one, and more a "I've got money and I want to keep it, and I want my quiet little town to stay a quiet little town" conservative.

She was my representative until the redistricting. Didn’t even realize it until I received my ballot. Glad she hung on to her seat without the Ojai Valley to help her. Also glad our new district is still has a Democrat representative.
No it's the classic pot meets kettle.It would be a deflection if I was arguing for China to be not held accountable.
The US is the one criticizing China here. So it's fair to examine the US in a similar context. An equivalent of what's happening here would be Russia/China/Iran criticizing human rights violations in a country, someone criticizing R/C/I for the hypocrisy and then someone saying ah the classic 'BUT THE R/C/I' deflection.

Hypocrisy is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another or the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform. In moral psychology, it is the failure to follow one's own expressed moral rules and principles. - from Wikipedia.

Not meant to justify or excuse it. But no way should US criticise and not expect some justification for their actions as well. As a matter of fact, the best thing the US could do is stop playing world police, accept some accountability for its own actions also for once and become a signatory of the ICC so the victims of its war crimes/resource lootings can be given justice.

If you think criticism should only be levied by someone who has an entirely clean slate, then we'd have no criticism of anything anywhere.

And your specific point being? The USA has invaded territories under false pretences and stole their oil, wreaking total havoc far worse than some fisherman bottom trawling the whole place. US companies have littered space with their satellites, which hinder astronomy everywhere. And then has the gall to sanction countries.
> “If we do not perform enough on mitigation, there is no money on Earth enough to address the consequences of the climate crisis,” Timmermans told The Associated Press. “The amounts of losses and damages will be such that we could never repair them.”.

In my country, the cities used to be designed for cars until around 50 years ago when they redesigned already existing cities into bike and public transport friendly cities (Netherlands btw) with major succes.

For rural american places yeah sure use cars, but for people in high population density places saying "transforming to a non-car city infrastructure in existing cities is ImPoSsiBLe" is just pure BS.
It's extremely common practice for senior military figures to play up threats and the need for military spending in peace time, in the US and plenty of other countries.

Is the world in a hot mess? Yes. Are there ongoing tensions and conflicts? Yes. But for America, this is officially peace time. You're not at war with anyone. Or have I missed a conflict?

True, it's officially peace time. But only for as long as Russia or China still see America as strong enough to deter them. Western Europe has been too complacent and Russia doesn't see Western European powers as more than a speed bump in terms of protecting NATO's eastern flank. If America were to take the same approach in failing to modernize and increase its military capability there would be both an invasion of Taiwan and an invasion of the Baltics in the next few years with more invasions to follow after that.

Is it really "peace time" when Russia has declared a holy war against the West threatening to attack Nato countries, China is building up to invade Taiwan and threatening the US with war in case US were to interfere, North Korea is doing missile tests it claims are simulations attacks against the US and Iranian regime is acquiring nuclear weapons while its leader is promising death to America?
Yeah, UNSC Army Reserves should be called up to deal with the mess. Deployment of a Spartan team would be a gross misallocation of valuable resources, some disagree though.
Exactly, NK has always been a Russian/Chinese vassal state ever since the Korean War. NK does not have the capability to manufacture the missile systems that they are demonstrating. Its a demonstration of Chinese capabilities in a way that avoids criticism of China on the world stage.

Some South Koreans do (particularly the older ones who may have family in the North, obviously), some don't... North Koreans probably do (we don't know but can assume) due to indoctrination.

But unification is opposed by all "relevant" countries (that have signed the armistice, i.e. North Korea, China, Russia, the US). Japan also opposes it (already enough competition from South Korea). They prefer a weaker divided nation and keep the status quo. Otherwise they would have let unification happen already; it's an international issue beyond the Koreas because of the agreement.

Reuniting west and east Germany was costly and there are still economical differences between east and west. Reunifying Korea will be a shitshow and could probably bankrupt better Korea.
All that stuff like a flight computer, windows, and wings are just optional extras Big Aircraft tacks on to inflate the purchase cost. Don't be a sucker, Putin, rip those optional extras out!
He is right, dudes on record saying he will pay this price 3x over. Just listen to some recent Fiona Hill interviews, you don’t have to wonder what vlad is thinking because he literally is out there saying he’s at war with the west. Should probably take him seriously on that.

Without coming out and saying it they are saying they are going to fly with broken parts. Which is fine if the coffee maker is broken. It’s not fine when the backup or safety system is broken. A fully functional airline, with no spare parts, would park some planes and strip them every time they need a coffee maker, lav pump, or backup generator. Russia is saying fly them all.

So if you’re Russia and you don’t care about a preventable plane crash or two per year (because let’s be honest Boeing and airbus planes are fucking incredible feats of engineering and won’t all crash the second redundancy is removed) then go for it.
The more fair comparison is not OIF and OEF, but the first gulf war. OIF and OEF were mostly fought against insurgent type forces and not organized militaries. Ukraine isn't a hodgepodge of insurgents, they are a standing military nation backed by a government. Desert Storm was the US lead coalition versus the standing Iraqi army. At the time, Iraq was supposed to have the 4th largest army in the world behind the big 3 super powers of the US, Russia, and China, and they were battle hardened after wars with Iran and an invasion of Kuwait. The coalition absolutely mopped the floor with the Iraqi army. There was never a question of who had air superiority and the US defeated the elite Republican Guard in less than a day during the Battle of 73 Easting. The whole ground war was pretty much over in less than 100 hours. You can read the official details of each movement . That's the war Russia expected to conduct, but they found out very quickly that they were not the US and their allies.
questionable, if they're really ethnic russians, more likely from 170+ minorities in federation, who think they're russians, until they visit Moscow or Petersburg...

But we haven’t seen the full extent of the impact of this war on the people living in territory held and attack by Russians. Ukrainian civilians are likely paying a steep price.

They have been cutting spending on everything for years to try to push privatization. It is literally a textbook ring wing move. First they cut funding for a government service, like healthcare or postal services. They keep making cuts until the system starts to fail. Then they proclaim "See, government can't manage things We should let private sector take over cause private sector is a magic cure all that can do anything and everything perfectly".

They are trying to kill healthcare, education, and more. Likely, they are cutting defense spending to force more spending on private services and more equipment.

For a vote of no confidence to pass you need a 2/3 majority which the Tories can easily put down. They won’t allow a general election to be called because they know they will not be re-elected. They will milk this for all it’s worth until around 17th December 2024 when they are legally required to call an election.

They'll just say "It would be an economic disaster if the pilots go on strike", then a large bipartisan majority will vote to simply impose the contract on them. And then the "most pro-union president in American history" will sign it.

They already did. The Railway Labor Act applies to both the rails and airlines, so Congress can sell out the pilots just as easily as they did the rail workers.

Also fuck executives for talking about the "hand of the free market" whenever workers lose out, but then they go crying to their pocket onahole/senator the minute the market turns against them for bailouts and legislation to protect their failing system.
Then the society is left with choices. Target the destructive behaviors (quell the rebellion) or target the underlying sense of hopelessness. I'm not surprised that throughout history the first option is much more common. Society tends to want to maintain its structure which caused the reaction that needs to be addressed, and addressing the underlying causes is usually really expensive (both monetarily and politically). Eliminating slavery would end slave revolts, but it would also tank the economy and cause a massive political reaction at best (for example - although Lincoln was opposed to slavery it was not clear he had the political capital to actually eliminate it until the south rebelled over fear he would and even then he only personally abolished it in the rebelling states because that was an easier lift).
If a group of people had their freedom of movement and opportunities for work and advancement restricted, they may to behaviors that are detrimental to society like violence, destruction of property, theft, or terrorism. This can be explained and understood without having to excuse the behavior.

I mean what are the odds that a group of strangers with no political affiliations with each other all randomly decided to show up on Washinon DC that day and then all spontaneously did what they did with no organization or motive or leadership. Honestly one of the strangest things I've ever seen, sociologists will be studying it for years to try and figure out what caused it all. Maybe when Trump gets re-elected he can form a committee to look into why all that Jan 6th stuff happened? I think the American people deserve answers.

Very true. But in the event of a war, the government needs to keep its population creators in the country so that they keep making babies. If a country has a deviating war and they loose both genders, the country will continue to suffer far longer than 1 generation.
At this level, the rule makers aren't looking at individual equality but instead long term preservation. If they send all people, they loose population in the current and future generations. Instead they want/need a baby boom after.

The nazis did something like this prior to the war they started. Not forced breeding but propaganda encouraging children, and then a follow-on program for raising them.

This was the Lebensborn program. While a common misperception was that it was a " breeding" program, in fact it was more " unwed mothers homes". Good Aryan young ladies who found themselves in this predictament when it was not accepted to be an unwed mothers were encouraged to place their infants into these homes, where they were placed for adoption with good party members.

The encouragement for families was the " kinder, kuche, kurche" propoganda. " children, kitchen, church". Married women were encouraged to be good homemakers and have lots of babies. The purpose of the BDM- the girls version of the Hitler Youth- was to teach girls these skills in order to be suitable wives and mothers for the Reich Matches between BDM girls and HY/ party members boys were encouraged.

Realizing that they needed even more children, the Germans also instituted a policy of kidnapping young " aryan looking" children from occupied countries and giving them to party member families. Fictitious records and birth certificates were created in order to obscure the origin of these children, making it nearly impossible to trace or find them after the war.

To the surprise of no one, the response generally wasn't very well-received by the public (including women too) as it watered down the sacrifices that men have been obliged to make since 1967 when mandatory conscription first became a legal duty for us men.

Recently it's been gaining attention once again within the locals news, podcasts and general chit chat amongst the public because covid really put a dent on our healthcare system and many people felt women could be conscripted to take on non-combative roles such as nurses, drivers, logistics personnel, etc. to fill the holes in our workforce that we weren't aware existed until covid hit us hard.

It’s basically a way for small nations, like small pacific islands, to ensure their safety, and not have to worry about defense since they couldn’t mount a sensible defense against anyone even with the whole population mobilized.

That's a very positive spin on it but the reality is that the United States offers that so it can maintain its ability to project itself militarily. The American Territories were conquered as a way of facilitating empire and they would not be offered independence if it wasn't all but guaranteed they would continue to allow that.

If Walker beats Warnock it it's going to make me deeply reconsider the institution of democracy because it'll become abundantly, painfully clear that some people are in fact too stupid to choose their own representation...

His idiocy pales in comparison to how much of a psychopath he is, famously holding knives, guns, and even a straight edged razor against his ex-wife's face, and choking her unconscious on different occasions.
Updating more like. Expanding the amount of nukes that are functional. What do you suggest? A few extra makes no difference in the grand scheme of things. The amount we hold now would end the world easily.
I'm just saying there is little difference between hundreds and thousands, the end is the same if they are used. What do these officials saying this stuff want to actually DO about it?

The US doesn't inspect their entire military, and even the most corrupt Russian oligarchs know that a working nuclear arsenal is the only security they have for them to keep running their little kleptocracy.

Russia has a modern nuclear arsenal, as verified by 150+ on-site indistinct by US experts of sites, warheads, and delivery systems over the last ten years or so - half of those inspections were unannounced.

To you maybe, but the larger nuclear powers think differently. The US and Russian Militaries wouldn't be completely wiped out even in a full scale war and they plan on fighting for the ruins left over.

The US has forces and bases covering the entire planet, even if the US and Europe were glassed, all the US carriers would need to be hit, all the US island bases too, the African bases, the Middle eastern bases, all US allies ( including Australia & Japan too), etc.

Russia has contingency plans hiding equipment and material in the middle of nowhere Siberia, not that they could really do anything substantial, but both governments still plan past the "End of the world".

It'd be easier to build a modern nuclear arsenal than it would be to deceive 160 inspections teams with the access they had across the entire country.

In any case, the failures of Russia in Ukraine are largely due to piss poor logistics, training (at the officer and enlisted/conscripted level), morale, and corruption. If tanks are ordered to advance unsupported and get destroyed, it's not an indictment of the tank. Same as if it runs out of fuel and is captured.

During 2007-2008 particularly, our ER swelled with patients who’d either had their hours cut or lost their job entirely as well as their health insurance that went with it. They had nowhere else to go, with no money for cost-prohibitive COBRA plans, and/or they were refused insurance altogether for ‘pre-existing conditions’ (this Republican supported practice is especially evil). Toward the end of ‘08, elective surgeries at our hospital were exploding, with patients claiming they were losing their health insurance and had to have their surgery quickly before it was gone. By early Jan.’09, the OR was practically empty and the hospital began mass layoffs—even staff with 10+ yrs seniority.

so he wants to stop people from being taught the vague term “ideologies” that he doesn’t like bc he considers them “political”…it’s wild to see that now everything is becoming political. Science. History. English. I bet even math will become political soon. They’ve amped up their war against education and it’s scary how blind people are to see it. Supporters will say “you shouldn’t be forced to learn about that” “they’re forcing people to become liberal”…NOBODY is FORCING anything on anybody. What a fucking shame these people think that their students / children aren’t able to THINK for themselves. Do they think that no conservatives come out of college conservative? I can bet there are, didn’t a lot of those conservatives in government get a degree from “liberal” universities? What happened to them? Aren’t they LIVING PROOF that people can freely think for themselves and make decisions on what they want to believe in? No, Florida just wants to dictate and control what people are even exposed to or hear about. They want the GOVERNMENT to control what professors teach and HOW they teach it. When will climate science become unreachable in Florida? That could be considered an “ideology” of the right-wing who thinks that climate science is just politics to control the world. I’m fucking tired of how blind people are to this demagoguery. The right will literally say “ government is too big, it can’t make me pay taxes to fund somebody’s education or housing or food” but will then say government has the power to control women’s body and choices, control what books you’re able to read or what classes u can take or the content u learn; these people have actual brain rot. These people really are just full of anger and resentment and hatred.
That's cool of Heinz and all, but after having spent a month lost at sea surviving on ketchup, he probably wants a new boat about as bad as he wants another bottle of ketchup.
I believe when they offered him a boat he told them to "shove it up their ass" as he is never getting on a boat again. It almost killed him the last time.

Maybe I’m being pedantic...but I’m pretty sure he didn’t survive because of the condiments (saying he survived on them implies this). He would have been starving since the condiments would not be enough to sustain him, people can go a month without food, it just happened he had condiments which gave him a small thing to consume while he was starving. So, the ketchup company is just using this as marketing opportunity. This guy survived on his own and they are spinning it as their product is the reason he survived.

I don’t think you can get all the hydration you require from condiments. If so, this guy was sailing with a lot of condiments and sure I could see that amount sustaining him if that’s actually how much that was on board.

He had to get water from somewhere and unless he had a way to desalinate sea water and they failed to report other beverages he consumed, it seems logical.

Also, there's plenty of room between strong Manchin style moderates and staunch progressives, so it's not like "not nominating a progressive again" needs to be all that bad.

Two of the new districts were competitive vs. one previously. GOP was able to pick up one of them plus the one they traditionally held. Schrader, the previous "Democrat" who held the seat voted with the GOP.

Not really though. Democrats made an effort to provide balanced districts which is hard to do in a state like OR that has rational, science based voters and mail in voting.

The Overton window in the US has steadily been marching leftward over the past 20 years or so. Manchin voted for a gargantuan stimulus that massively dwarfed the 2009 stimulus, and also voted for the biggest climate bill in history, which also expanded healthcare and reformed prescription drugs. He may not be as liberal as we'd like but he's no conservative.

Pretty much sums it up. District 5 will be close no matter what. The other districts not so much. 2 will probably always be far right and the rest most likely left.

And Obama said the ACA was a republican plan. Turns out politicians play fast and loose with the truth in order to appeal to swing voters. That's fine - but it doesn't mean they are actually correct.

I mean Fetterman is just the sort of politician who I'm talking about - someone who is far from the hardcore Manchin style moderate, but also far from a Bernie/AOC progressive. He's sorta progressive in a sense but focuses a lot on pocketbook issues and doesn't have the radical campus activist thing of "gotta take the leftmost stance on every issue and be loud about it" that some on the left are into. He's someone like Sherrod Brown imo, another one who seems to be in the good middle ground.

That's basically right from Biden's platform, far from the staunch medicare for all support that Bernie/AOC progressives call for.

So, as opposed to the progressive "green new deal, no fracking, stop fossil fuels" stance, he's for shifting to green energy but still supporting fossil fuels too, that's right around where the normie liberal stance is.

So basically "a pathway to citizenship and make legal immigration a bit easier but also increase border security", sounds pretty moderate compared to the progressive "decriminalize undocumented border crossings" stances we saw in the 2020 primaries.

Meanwhile according to the stances Fetterman actually took, as per my citations from literally his website, he didn't run as a hard core liberal, but basically as a normie establishment Democrat, someone like Biden.

You are saying he ran as a "hard core liberal" but using the skewed accusations of his opponents to support that.

Well they were on the verge of launching nukes into Ukraine when cooler heads prevailed and they can either start nuking Ukraine or attempt to attack the US, NATO, or other allies escalating a war that our president has no hesitations about supporting.
From the beginning they threatened utter immediate destruction like the world has never seen ... if the West gave ANY military aid ... after the West already had.

I don't see why we don't supply the longer range rockets for Himars (ATACMS), its range is no greater than existing Ukrainian weapons, and it doesn't violate arms control agreements as far as I know. Compared to the Iranian drones they are short range. Think Putin out psyched the west.

NATO has loads of Gepards in storage, although rounds are scarce because it isn't used much any more. Ukraine is already using them, seems an obvious choice, but possibly maintenance is an issue as no one was planning to use them.
I am not sure it is within the UN mandate to recognize or not recognize any state as a legal successor of any other. As for the individual countries, the US specifically recognized Russia as USSR successor on Dec 25, 1991. If you specifically means succession within the UN structures, there wasn't a vote indeed. Instead, the CIS members (including Ukraine) formally agreed to this, and then corresponding request from Russia was circulated among the UN members and none of them challenged it. Ukraine by the way had been a full member since the UN foundation, so it was perfectly in position to do so if it wanted to. However it was deemed convenient to let Russia deal with Soviet shit in return for certain privileges in the UNSC (which Ukraine couldn't have anyway, even if they were denied to Russia).
Though this argument makes legalistic sense, something tells me, Putin will happily rename the country back into Soviet Union. UPD: the entire UN needs a major reform, otherwise it will continue being a farce.

they don't have to because their behavior is being enabled. they know that the Federal government won't just let people freeze to death, and they also know that there will be no consequences for their actions. they can just keep taking the money and laugh all the way to the bank. the only way to break this cycle is for the leaders of texas to see consequences for their greed and negligence, but the political brainwashing is so complete that the same leaders get re-elected time and time again. so all we have left is a vicious downward spiral of greed and negligence that will never be solved by attempting to shame texan leaders on twitter. they simply are making too much money and do not have souls.
Yeah... as a "disaster enthusiast" I concur. I'm basically a veteran storm chaser that keeps an eye on all things that could naturally destroy humanity... and what I can bear to make myself look at is beyond words.
They're likely not far off... the injured to dead ratio out of Syria is horrific. I don't think I've seen another disaster other than aircraft crashes with worse numbers than what are coming out of Syria. I don't know enough about Syria itself to grasp the numbers, but it's looking extremely grim for them.

It's gonna be 100k+ in the best scenario. Most of the wreckages are yet to receive help and it's been 45 hours. It's likely the last nights of people under the buildings. Some cities and towns are destroyed completely. The city of Hatay was wiped off the map.

What scares me is how low the "injured" count currently is for the whole region vs the scope of the devastation.

That's the best scenario by the way. A town of 160.000 was completely destroyed. All of the buildings in the town are collapsed. And that's only 1 town. Do the math yourself for 10 cities.

I think the Independents that decide the majority of elections were just unwilling to go for the extremists, that just kept ramping up their rhetoric even when it was clearly the wrong move. They may not have voted for the Democrat either, but could not make themselves vote (R).

Would it not be better if they won the House also. What I see in general media so far, it seems that "traditionally" the House are won by opposition party during midterms (regardless which party is governing), what interest me is why the incumbent party never manage to win a second term also.

So it seems like a bombshell development that, last week, Trump finally agreed he will—at some point—let his lawyers collect a sample of his DNA for comparison.

With E. Jean Carroll’s trial against Donald Trump set to start in April, the former president’s legal team has a new gambit they hope will dismantle her case and cast serious doubt on the claims that Trump raped her sometime in the mid-1990s.

The last-minute surprise centers on the one piece of physical evidence—an infamous black coat dress—that Carroll says she was wearing when he allegedly forced her against a wall at a Manhattan department store and sexually assaulted her.

For three years, Carroll has hectored Trump over the tantalizing prospect that his DNA is still on the dress—a prospect that’s been made even more tantalizing because Trump won’t submit to a DNA test.

But they're getting a lot of stuff done in those 12 days like checks notes breaking a strike to make sure wealth railroad companies don't have to negotiate with their unions, and guaranteeing the "religious freedom" of non-profits and state governments to discriminate against LGBT people.

I mean I feel like they could just pass legislation that says railroad workers get at least 5 sick days a year which I believe is what was asked for. But then again chance that wouldn’t pass.

Agreed but being forced into this situation is an advantage to start with railroad workers. Other workers who do not get this advantage go hey I want that too. Which turns into another party thing to run on.

Dems should turn this around and say: "While the citizens of Texas were freezing in the dark, why did Abbot care more about illegal immigrants by sending them to places with heat and electricity?".

I feel for the people of Texas too but it's ridiculous that FEMA is gonna end up footing the bill for all this help again. This is not a straight up natural disaster, they're allowing this to happen on purpose. Abbott is piece of human trash, while his people are freezing he's wasting money playing games shipping immigrants to the VP's house at the same time. Which he should be in jail for on it's own, frankly.
Pictured is a non-disposable vape with someone filling new juice, while the article talks almost entirely about disposable vapes. Thanks Guardian for not bothering to differentiate between the two.
Disposable vapes are awful and need to be banned worldwide. Too much plastic and battery waste for a couple hundred puffs. Refillable pods and coils go way longer.

Well said and Agreed. Always thought those disposables were convenient but horrible long term. Those bottles seem recyclable l. Just plastic and lasts the user a long time from what I've seen. Not to mention how demonized e cigs have become and yet saved thousands, millions of lives maybe for former smokers. Saved millions in hospital bills probably.

Yep, this is exactly how my mom quit smoking. Cold Turkey / tapering never worked for her so she bought some rechargeable & refillable e-cigs (w/ extra batteries), got various strenhs of vape juice, and just gradually diluted it over time until she got all the way down to 0mg Nicotine then just forced herself to put it down for good.

ETA: TBF, this was before disposables existed but I think she still would have gone this route since I don’t think you can have such fine control over the nicotine content with disposables.
there are no trophies for any of this, we absolutely just die at the end of the run. Social media, consumerism keeps people trapped in a dopamine loop indoctrinated from birth to do and say things that no matter what will keep the system running just fine throughout their lifecycle. The koolaid works long enough for most but theres oodles of folks that saw from early on the hypocrisy. Those at the top know this and work tirelessly to maintain the balance of the illusion that we need the system, creating divides and problems only remedied by it. Technology has outpaced it, the pandemic exposed the cracks, and climate change will catalyze the needed changes much faster. We react, react, react. When do we proact? The unfortunate truth is that the next 10 years are going to fucking suck and we always had the option to do something different but decided not to.

"...the ministry did not disclose details about the contents, method of delivery or schedule of Finland's military aid package...".
Just wanted to point out the monetary size of the packages does not correlate to the real value of the material being sent overtly and in most cases covertly.

There is a ton of Finnish material that has shown up in Ukraine without any announcements from Finland and i assume these announcements are just to have public paper trail for after the war.

The Finns have been sending way more than they publicly acknowledge likely as to make it more difficult for Russia to assess how much Finland has left.

The aid from Finland has been appreciable - based on what's been confirmed on . Finland's showing their commitment to joining NATO by keeping deliveries of aid prompt and consistent it seems (but maybe that's just the Finns being Finns). .

Great. Frankly we should send even more, though I’m in favour of keeping it all a secret. Our whole military inventory was bought to battle Russians, so I’m just glad this material is being used for its intended purpose.
And while a lot of that is due to internal propaganda… some citizens simply can’t admit they previously supported someone that is no good. Similar to how pro-gun people supported trump even after he said he’d consider taking peoples’ guns away without due process. It’s simply too hard to back down.
"2nd most votes ever" is just pure copium, the mantra of a loser. Trump is done and dusted; he was the ultimate RINO to begin with!

On the flip side, Trump alienated a ton of people on 'his side' with the sheer disrespect he showed to recently deceased people like McCain. If Trump had just shut his mouth and turned off twitter after winning the presidency, he might still be president.

Perhaps Trump's diehard supporters have forgotten these things, but I guarantee you there's plenty of republicans that have not.

And there's a reason why Trump lost his reelection, because he had simply pissed off just enough of his own base from key battleground states to lose them and Trump just thought they'd all vote like they had the first time!? Trump got a taste of the problem Hillary had; voters were either diehard fans or apathetic and angry at Trump's antic's. His whole stop the steal bluster is Autocracy101 in the making right there and turned off even more people that were not diehard supporters. Trump himself says he looks up to people like Putin, thank the celestial teapot that Trump did not actually rig the election beforehand because that smug fuck thought that he'd already won.

Yeah, Trumped was divisive. He pissed people off. But he also had a ton of support. It's even more impressive when you consider that he was against Hillary the first election, then Biden the second (and Biden is going to drum up far less GOP opposition - even though there were attempts to smear Biden he's just not going to rally the GOP against him).

That's like asking why is the highest grossing movie usually from the last few years or at most a decade; because there's more people overall watching at more theaters (and more IMAX/etc that inflate price per ticket) now than there was in the 70's or 80's.

Use a little common sense. It's not explained by population growth, because the population didn't grow by 11 million. It's TOTALLY disingenuous to say that 4 years population growth is anywhere near comparable to 50 years of population growth (your example I think?).

There were 17.1 million more votes cast in 2020 compared to 2016. Trump did gain 11-12 million in 2020 compred to 2016, but there is no reliable way to verify your claims. Regardless, you are just pulling numbers out of your ass because there is double the number of eligible voter increased to what you cited. Plus, you are saying Trump got every new eligible voter and then some? It doesn’t even make sense unless the US is suddenly like Russia or Venezuela. Go do some fact checking once in a while and stop guzzling down that propaganda you love so much. Dumbass sheep.

But it is explainable by something like population growth. It makes perfect sense, and if you think Trump's 74 million votes was some kind of earth-shattering record, imagine how much more votes he would've gotten - especially in the key battleground states where it actually matters - if he hadn't continually pissed off his base nearly every chance he got. All because Trump couldn't resist throwing snark on twitter. "Owning libs" doesn't count for much when he shot himself in the foot every other week.

He can't have pissed off his base that much, as so many of them voted for him (more than Obama's base in Obama's best year). But yeah, he pissed off the democrats enough for them to bother voting.

Trump lost due to his own actions plain and simple; just like Hillary's clear corruption in the runup to the election caused just enough democrats in the right swing states to not vote, the same thing happened to Trump during his reelection. It doesn't matter how many votes he got, they weren't in the right states that mattered, again thanks to Trump's stupid twitter comments!

There weren't 10 million new voters, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that even if you think that every 18 year old and migrant who got gained citizenship voted for him it STILL doesn't come close to explaining all the votes he got.
When the Trump news broke I was thrilled that this was serious enough to send him to jail and end his political career. Since this Biden fiasco came about there are 2 options and they both suck, 1) Bidens is swept under the rug and Trump gets charged. This proves those people right and makes Trump look stronger or 2) they both pay the price for mishandling classified information. Gray area comes in the Russia Investigation in which Mueller said the DOJ wouldn’t indict a sitting president. Which means Biden would be indicted in 2024 as there is a greater chance he would not be re-elected, so what’s the point of waiting?

The most horrifying part is that no matter what side or what reasoning, the girls and women involved are just used as tools in these ongoing battles. Their autonomy and consent is never part of the equation. At the end of the day, the abortions at the hands of the military was more about the destruction of insurgents than it was about doing "right" by these girls and women. In every single case, they threatened more violence unto the women they were "protecting" from their kidnappers who brought the same violence into these girls and women's lives. They threatened them if they did not comply with the military's procedures. It's so damn disturbing what these girls and women went through by Boko Haram and the nightmare didn't end just because their own military held them.
To be fair, everybody in the equation is a complete pawn suffering untold horrors at the mercy of anyone with the tiniest amount of money/power. This is why the region gets destabilized so easily over and over.

The vast vast majority of these women were captured and forcibly "married" to BH insurgents, who regularly beat and raped them. They are now doubly traumatised for the crime of being women in the middle of a brutal fundamentalist conflict.

It's hard to underestimate how conservative and pious the northeasterners are. These allegations will result in entire communities rejecting the authority of the Nigerian state - which, in the northeast, is almost exclusively represented by the army outside of the major cities/state capitals. An extremely counterproductive move that will weaken Abuja's attempts to win the trust and consent to govern from the northeast population.
It is possible Aldrich is nonbinary, and hiding it behind anger and self-loathing and irony. It is possible Aldrich is nonbinary, but it means nothing to them, they're just an unrepentant sociopath. And it's also possible Aldrich is a man calling himself nonbinary because it'd be funny. Personally, I'm using they/them for Aldrich, just in case they are in a lot of pain, but I don't fault others who are too angry at Aldrich to care. The wide range of trust/distrust towards a mass murderer doesn't disprove the validity of gender expression, any more than it proves we shouldn't trust people in general.

I heard Andrew Weissman say something about looking out for an announcement about charges on or just after the 24th of January. I'm not sure why he said that specific date, but I'm primed for that time since for some reason, it seems to line up to me like a reasonable time period following the special grand jury being wrapped up. Everything takes "two weeks", and it may be in a grand jury's hands already (to indict - the special grand jury was not for that, only for investigative purposes), so the end of the month should be fun, hopefully Superbowl season will be wild.

I would pay to be in a courtroom when they ask him why he named that exact number of votes. Any answer is incriminating so he will probably take the 5th but oh to feel the crackle of electricity in the air at that moment.

Also, Willis doesnt have to wait until the 24th to make this decision. She could convene a grand jury today and get the ball rolling if she wanted too. So you can prime yourself for the 24th, but really could be any day now.

Based on the article, it sounds like what the proposed bill would do is basically remove the distinction between men and women in South Korea as far as mandatory civil defense training goes:
The article is portraying this bill as being controversial and a means to attract young male voters. Of particular note from the article:

Sure, the U.S. is there, but that's putting faith of your country's livelihood on another foreign entity. Meanwhile, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, look at the vast majority of Western Europe (France, Germany, Baltic states, etc.) increase spending on home defense even when they have the US pledge for defense (NATO).

The same question can be asked of the 'womens groups'. Why arent they advocating for the end of mandatory service instead of what theyre doing - trying to keep it (unequally) male-only.

The bill would result in the same outcomes for both genders. Therefore its an equality bill. Being protested by the group that doesnt benefit from it.
They don’t exactly want another war in gaza and refugees flooding into sinai for treatment because the last time they did that weapons and terrorist got in to fight along side isis in Sinai.
The last time was in 2020 or 2021 i think during the last conflict in gaza we opened the border to allow the injured to go into sinai for treatment since their hospitals were either damaged or didn’t have the capacity to treat the injured we slso sent ambulances across the border.

Europe is tired after getting its share of terror attacks. It's focused on Russia. The Arab states no longer provide unequivocal support to palestinians after seeing years of maiximalist demands. . And the palestinian authority is inept and dying. The Israeli left has died after years of Israelis being, well, literally shot to death. And most importantly.

The West Bank is in danger of becoming ungovernable - especially once Abbas goes. I don't know who his successor would even be, but the Jenin raid was into territory the PA should be policing, but doesn't because it would weaken its support further... and with the PA suspending security co-operation, that's an intelligence stream gone that makes it harder for Israel to prevent attacks.

Germany at most delayed the delivery of leopards to ukraine by 8 days. And in return, got the USA to commit to send their tanks.

And realistically, it was probably less than 8 days actual delay because Poland and Ukraine probably used some of those 8 days to plan the transport of tanks, training staff and trainees.

I had this argument over whether Germany did or did not say they would send jets. Scholz said so back in September 2022.

2) so what? That doesn’t mean that Germany is going to say no to jets. But does Germany even have jets to send in the first place?

But he doesn't like that it's making him look bad. The German military has had incompetent civilian leaders for years. Which lead to the bad position they are in now. Combine that with him seeming to want an off ramp every single chance. Yes it makes the German government look bad.

Him sending jets or not is not the point. It's that Germany is consistently looking like a roadblock at every stage of the war.

I’d like to remind you that Poland hadn’t even made an official request to Germany about sending the tanks before talking all that shit. Looks like you fell prey to their political tactic of shitting on Germany to make Poland look good.

In response to your 2nd point, everyone’s commitment came recently. It’s a group effort to send tanks to Ukraine.

In response to your 3rd point, it’d a group effort and the US is the largest contributor. Sending a few tanks isn’t very helpful, but sending a big batch is. And I don’t know what went on behind the scenes, but maybe Germany said “send your tanks too or we won’t send any” to force the US to also send tanks (just maybe, not saying that’s what did happen).

Whatever your personal feelings are, it is a fact that Nancy Pelosi is one of the most skilled Speakers we have ever had. She negotiated ways to navigate the slim majority and every GOP attempt to obstruct sound legislation for 2 years.

The remaining moderates are Democrats. The current GOP is a fascist anti-democratic party that caters to angry racists and fanatical religious zealots. There is no room in our government for that.

7%, as per the OBR, this is the worst fall since records began. Furthermore, house prices are likely to drop by up to 9% over the next 2 years.
Why are falling house prices so grim? By all accounts wasn't housing massively overpriced and unaffordable? The same thing happens here in the US where the media cheerleads for high housing prices.

If it's anything like the US, it's that meme of the guy hiding behind the tree rubbing his hands, as the corporations salivate at all the money they'll make renting out single family homes. They're just waiting for a fire sale where people lose there jobs and are forced to sell at a reduced price.

They aren't going to sell if their not getting equal or more than they bought it for unless their desperate, so although prices drop would be great for buyers, the stock is going to massively reduce anyway. Then you get into supply and demand territory of the houses that do go to market will be outbid sky-high.

The point I'm more making is that everybody hails this as great for first time buyers etc, however, all that will happen is that the houses will be advertised as cheap, but the first time buyers will end up in biding wars they will invariably lose.

In the US Congress, only Senators can have replacements appointed, and that's only in some states. Some states just have an appointee serve the remainder of the term, others have an appointee serve temporarily until a special election can be held, and still others keep the seat vacant until a special election.

Which is why this is going to get so much more interesting. Trump keeps floating an independent run which is even more likely considering Mitch McConnell hates Trump, and almost the entirety of the GOP infrastructure (which includes Fox) is for DeSantis.

Trump then runs independent, splits the Republican vote, and the Democrats can run a ham sandwich for president and they'll win. God knows, we'll need it.

How is nobody looking into where this loser got 700k to loan his campaign? His source of money has got to be as stinky as the rest of his story - Probably a Russian touching it somewhere.
It's a leaked Kremlin poll, which means it isn't actually a leak and it isn't actually a poll. It's the Kremlin testing the waters to see how people feel about the possibility of negotiating a settlement. Throw it out there like it's a leaked poll with middling support and see how people feel about it. If there's backlash against it (eg - "we should find who these traitors are and put them in prison"), then the government knows not to consider negotiating a settlement. If there isn't backlash (since few people would outright voice support for it since doing so is a criminal offense), then the government knows that it can consider negotiating a settlement because the populace won't reject it or rebel against it.
I've consistently heard that Russians tend to answer such questions not with their own opinion, but with the answer that they think will result in them being left alone to live their lives.

Reminds me of our former Prime Minister Najib (the famous 1MDB scandal) received some "gifts" from the Saudi or something back then.
As someone from Malaysia, it's not surprising that its the northern states, Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah that are ruled by the Malaysia Islamic Party (PAS). I'm a Muslim too but it's ridiculous they're implementing laws like these that are not irrelevant to the current situation.

Kelantan is facing floods and the fucker Minister there said it's because of rain and it's normal , that's all and nothing else. I've been seeing a trend of fascists these fuckers been going, which they're partnering with other parties under the National Alliance coalition.

In the early Clinton days I always felt the jealousy (and the lust) incle-boys Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich had for the Clintons. Lust for them and extreme jealousy of Bill's charisma. Once I realized that, listening to the RUsh Limbaugh show was a daily rant on that subject. They always tried to nail the Clintons, and of course, they never had anything on them.

At this point it is safe to say he has a mental illness. He should seek help and work on his issues. He needs to face the truth and overcome his insecurity. I hope he gets the help he needs.
I'm going to make a different prediction than these gloom and doom headlines. I think qanon, et al coming back to twitter will only hasten its end. There is a reason the "free speech" platforms aren't viable and it isn't because someone can't build them properly. It's because advertisers do not want their products next to racist or extremist content. I saw somewhere that half of advertising dollars to twitter have already been at least paused. This is not the kind of decision that will bring them back. Now I know Elon is worth something like 160b but almost none of that is liquid. Is he really going to burn Tesla up to keep twitter alive?

I wouldn’t go that far. I suspect it’s a mix of not enough time, not enough transport capacity and, if particularly cynical, the calculation that caring for a wounded man who won’t be returning to combat any time soon is a non-trivial resource drain…but one that’s easily turned into the enemy’s problem.
Looking back over Russia from the last century, I don't think any of the Russian officers have the resources, time, or empathy for their wounded soldiers.

Let's be honest, the main reason Russia leaves them is because it puts a burden on Ukraine and the West. Due to the nobility and empathy, I don't think we would just let anyone die if they could be treated.

Battlefield medicine has transformed so much and can preserve life, but at a cost of money and manpower. After the wounded soldiers get patched up they will need clothing, food, water, and someone to guard them.

If Russia wasn't using these soldiers trying to get Ukraine to spend money/time/energy on POWs, I shudder to think of what they might otherwise be used for.

we supply Ukraine with so much, this will not ad much money to the tally but oh my god that will do to russian morale and what tales will those wounded tell after the war.

Besides caring for enemy soldiers being the objectively moral good, this is positive propaganda that will absolutely shatter someone's worldview if they believe the West/NATO being some boogieman.
On a micro dose or small amount, basically unnoticeable. A slightly larger amount leads to giggles and a feeling of lightness, and mild nausea sometimes. Larger doses (for me) was a joyful laugh filled come up, feelings of lightness, appreciation of nature and connection to math in nature. At the highest dose I’ve tried, ego death, which gave me peace with my existence and place in the world and universe. Deep visuals in my minds eye when eyes closed. My favorite part: the beauty in nature and big laughs I waited until I was older to try them, and I’m glad I did.

They are trying to draw a false equivalence between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Who literally lives in a hotel that does keep track of exactly who visits because they are paying money to do so.
And this is why Iran and North Korea have announced acceleration of their nuclear weapons programs, and South Korea has announced that they want to start one. This war has taught the world that nuclear weapons are a foolproof deterrent against the overwhelming conventional power of the West, no matter how many war crimes or genocidal acts you commit. Sure, you'll likely become an economic backwater and international pariah if you do those things, but if you're already both then there is no downside to basing your national security on the threat of kicking off Armageddon. If we are representative of intelligent life, this is probably one of the reasons we've never found any contemporaries in our celestial neighborhood: the window between technological advancement and species suicide is extremely narrow.
But Amnesty reported what they saw, it's not propaganda since Amnesty reports also Russian crimes, hiding possible violations of international laws, even tho how necessary they would be, would be more propaganda.

The question comes down to just how crazy/demanding the MAGA nuts in the House turn out to be. It could be that McCarthy has to promise them so much just to get the job that he'll never be able to actually govern. And while that might be fine with the MAGAs, not every Republican is on board with that as a philosophy.

What if McCarthy's the one to make a deal with Hakeem Jeffries? Might he be able to get a better deal from him than he can get from the MAGAs? The MAGAs have nothing to offer for the next two years except a non-stop shitshow, with more drama and demands every single week. Making a deal with them might be the worst mistake ever.

I'd love to see it. It'd be a huge smack in the face to Republicans as a governing force. And it would cut down drastically on the numbskullery we're likely to see for the next two years. It could even be the first rift on the right that splits magas from the rest of the party.

OTOH, accepting votes from Dems will turn some Reps off, meaning he'd need even more votes from the Dems, which means they'd want even more in return.

Once upon a time, it was conventional wisdom that Republicans would fall in line. Be interesting to see how true that still is.

They don’t need to reassemble the insurance industry, once you’ve dismantled it you’ll have no choice but to use TrumpCare or DeSantisCare. Won’t that be lovely for women, POC, the queer and the poor?

Oh, did they discover the secret of keeping the GOP from the levers of power? Does Medicare for all only apply during years where the Democrats have control? Or are we going to have to worry about medical care being denied every time a republican wants to file up their base against “the other”?

Yep. West Virginia has quite the radical history for itself around communism, socialism, trade unionism. But much like the rest of this country, it's just a footnote now. And people really wonder why this country looks and functions like it does today? Please.

1939, near the end of the Great Purges, was 2,022,976. At about that time, there began a purge of the purgers, including many intelligence and secret police (NKVD) officials and members of the judiciary and other investigative committees, who were suddenly held responsible for the excesses of the terror despite their protestations of fidelity to the regime.

arrested for political crimes ("counterrevolutionary offenses") numbered from 12 to 33 percent of the prison population, varying from year to year. The vast majority of inmates were charged with nonpolitical offenses: murder, assault, theft, banditry, smuggling, swindling, and other violations punishable in any society.

Remember they lost the Senate the White House and Congress during Trump's reign. And now this disastrous midterm..... they cant afford to lose anymore.
Someone more knowledgeable please correct me here if I’m wrong, but this article seems like a rehash of old news without any new information or analysis.
Because defeat implies loss of territory which is absolutely not the case. Victory conditions are not purely based on casualties but also on territory, supply lines, diffusion of forces etc.

Lyman fell in early October. There is an ongoing offensive to capture the next major town to the east Kreminna, but it’s been slow moving due to Russian reserves pulled into the area and deteriorating weather and mud.

As far as I can tell, it is talking about an after-action analysis and the new information it has brought to light, namely how many losses this one particular recon unit has sustained.

Like.. yes these events took place a while ago now, but war being a huge mess it can often be hard to tell what just happened, and it can take a while to do all the investigation and piece the whole story together.

No one has that information except maybe the Kremlin (and given the way they are running the war I doubt even they have a clear picture), unless it is pieced together bit by bit by researchers and analysts. Even in wars that are 50 years in the past, people are still unearthing new data about this or that aspect of the war that was previously unknown.

I am not talking about news. The key parts of this article are not, "a battle took place on such and such a day," that is not the point. I'm talking about detailed analysis of enemy losses, and putting together a picture of what exact units were where, and at what time.

Like... this happens in all kinds of militaries around the world. Sometimes someone in strategic command makes a call about what a unit should be sent to do, that turns out to be a huge mismatch. The USA lost a bunch of their Special Forces a while back when they were given a task more suited to a regular infantry unit. Lacking the necessary combat support for a fixed engagement, the Special Forces people got crushed. It wasn't that they sucked, they were just fighting the wrong fight.

We've seen several cases of stuff like that happening in the Ukraine war too. Early on, Russia sent some kind of elite commando unit to take the airport in Kyiv. By all accounts they did the commando part of their mission well. But same thing as the USA... such a unit is not intended for protracted defensive combat in a fixed position. They might have been super stealthy, elite high mobility warriors or whatever, but when Ukraine knew they were coming, knew exactly where they were, and pinned them down... and there was no further support coming from Russia... that's not the commandos' wheelhouse, to say the very least.

Similarly there was some fearsome Russian special unit dedicated to infiltration and night operations or whatever... no doubt a bunch of elite dudes with the best training the universe has ever seen or whatever, but they were all killed when Ukrainian military intelligence found out which train they were on and blew the whole train up. Before they ever got close to the combat zone.

You can think of it like a game of "rock, paper, scissors." It's tempting to think about how good old rock always wins, can't beat rock... and then the other person hits you with paper.

There’s a big difference between top tier units and VDV, whose reputation seems to overshadow their abilities. I’m surprised they were tasked with such a critical objective. Even special units like GRU has are filled out by conscripts. I wonder to what extent fully professional units like Alpha have participated in operations, but they are more counter terror than direct action.

In any case, there’s probably not many Ukrainian units who would want to take on some of the vets from ops like Mariupol, Severodonetsk, units that did most of the fighting on right bank in Kherson. A lot of combat experience there, urban and otherwise.

Although of course all those units are severely degraded and likely part of ad hoc formations instead of battalion tactical groups like how they started, as recently reported by ISW.

There have been several waves of large missile strikes, with some of the deadliest still causing less than 100 casualties, so you’ll need to provide a source. Maybe you’ve confused missiles with artillery.
To kill bacteria overall, is simple. They are complex, but have so many “moving parts” that it’s pretty easy to find one to disrupt that kill the cell. You could add something that is toxic to the cell to kill it, heat it up to denature it’s membrane proteins and kill it, add substances that pierce the cell wall, and so forth. In comparison prions are so simple and stable, that by their nature you have to denature them to destroy them, there is no alternative. They have no metabolism to effect and no other “moving parts” they rely to be infectious on other then their innate physical properties. So to stop them you have to alter their physics properties which in comparison is harder. This is mainly why they’re so much more difficult to destroy.
The issue back when this was killing people in the 80s was they were feeding the cows their own byproducts, like brains. That was causing it to spread so I assume this practice has stopped.

I mean let's be honest, prion infected cows shipped across the world and then splattered all over the countryside doesn't sound like a biologically safe solution.

Her life had not been affected by this at much (after the first time, that is) because access to that medicine was simple enough. But now any doctor in Georgia prescribing it to her faces jail time because she has a functioning uterus and it could cause an abortion in the hypothetical scenario she had an embryo in there.

My sister had to flee the state because she had endometriosis. Every month she fails to fully shed her uterine lining, and if she doesn't get the proper medication to help me alone it starts to rot inside her and can kill her.

So now Georgia has lost another registered nurse while Illinois has gained one, and since she took her six year old daughter with her my father went from being able to see his only grandchild every week or two to seeing her once a year maybe.

Most who cast votes for such stupidity have no idea about human reproduction at all, and are too lazy or callous to bother learning. I wish her and your family good health.
It's very hard to put a specific percentage on it, because (1) the USSR's economy was non-market, other than where it interacted with the non-Communist world (e.g. selling oil). It had transfer pricing within its five year plans, but they were literally called something like "non-price prices". So all you can do is see the output and try to make a guess at what it would have cost to make it in a market economy. How do you put an accurate value on shitty Soviet consumer products (main cause of apartment fires in Moscow was TVs blowing up)? How do you put an accurate value on bizarre USSR military sh\t like the Caspian Sea Monster?
This may sound weird but the sheer amount of Soviet ammo out there that’s 30-40 years old is astonishing.

Arguments against mandatory sentencing include: (1) sentences are often greatly disproportionate to the severity of the offense; (2) the focus on particular kinds of offenses has tended to have a major negative impact upon certain categories of offenders and particular social groups; (3) removing discretion from judges shifts it toward the police and prosecution; (4) the severity of punishment under mandatory sentencing may lead offenders to actively contest charges against them, leading to increased workloads for courts and creating major drains on legal aid services; (5) it may cause erosion of natural justice as part of the plea bargaining process; (6) punishment is not particularly effective as a general deterrent, or even as a deterrent for specific offenders; (7) putting people in prison is expensive; (8) there is little evidence that the policy reduces crime; (9) it does little if anything for victims; and (10) there are less expensive and more effective alternatives to prison.
"D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is calling on the U.S. Senate not to vote for a resolution — already approved by the House — that would prevent the District from implementing a new criminal code that includes lighter mandatory penalties for some violent crimes.".
Arguably (the arguments are bad, but they're there) it's not, which is why China is so annoyed with Putin. China has consistently said that because Taiwan is "special" in that they never established sovereignty on a global-scale (deeply flawed argument, but technically true since even the US has been slow to recognize them) they are different from countries like Ukraine and (reading between the lines) therefore can be invaded without violation of sovereignty.
By invading Ukraine using a slap-dash combination of reasons that includes this argument (that Ukraine and other former USSR states are "special") Putin has tied Ukraine and Taiwan together, which actually weakens China's position as a whole and exposes in real-time why it's an unacceptable argument. These countries ARE sovereign, whether their former imperialist regimes like it or not.

While I agree with your comment in general, I think your representation of Taiwan's political situation is wrong. In particular, it's not that "they never established sovereignty on a global-scale", it's that they lost such recognition. Taiwan (or rather, Republic of China) was the only China there was for decades, and even after the civil war and establishment of the PRC on the mainland, ROC was a permanent member of the UN SC until 1971. Your post seems to suggest that Taiwan is a separatist state trying to break away from "their former imperialist regime". No. Taiwan is the former imperialist regime.

If I'm not mistaken, the official position of both PRC and ROC is that there is only one sovereign state: China, consisting of both mainland and Taiwan. The dispute is over which of the two is the legitimate government, a bloodless continuation of the civil war that never formally ended.

Yeah Twitter or Reddit aren't exactly technically innovative in any way. But they are powerful as long as a large enough chunk of the population use them generating content others want to see. That majority also seems fine with some level of moderation to eliminate the worst actors that might make it too toxic. No one is flocking to the zero moderation alternatives that cropped up after Trump or others got shut down. But users are also fickle when it comes to social media when complaints get loud enough and your platform is seen as uncool. Changing momentum is hard and I wouldn't bet a dollar on the a specific start up vying for the crown, but eventually it can turn in a hurry and Twitter can become Digg.
are these the guys that are still lying about the 2020 election? they get more pathetic and sad every day. kushner's company made 5 billion from the saudis while he was working in the white house. ivanka got 18 trademarks in china in two months while working in the white house. hunter never worked in the white house, and his dad got him a cushee job with a gas company in ukraine while he was in office. ? so what? trump has committed two dozen felonies, that we know of, some live on tv and others recorded for posterity, since 2015. biden has served his country his whole life, while donnie donuts became a professional fraud and crook. im sure hunter is a spoiled goofball. not sure what else these clowns think they have. grade school playground tit for tat. pathetic and sad. waste of time and money. america wants good paying jobs. republicans want to save face for their own gullibility in backing a criminal for president.

This is amazing...I could give 2 craps if someone dresses in drag. But how the far right republicans go after drag and then someone who aligns with them is secretly doing it is just comically entertaining. This movement doesn't know what it stands for but it knows it hates something and just wants to be angry.

It’s not that they’re scared of what they did/do, it’s that they’re bad people and bad people are two faced, hypocritical, lying sacks of shit. They shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near government jobs..
As Korean American. I would not have kids in Korea. Its hell raising kids there. So many educational cost just to stay competitive and expensive housing omg…. I understand why people in korea dont want kids.
This could rise in the next 10 years, which would mean that people born 1990-1995 will get more kids during those years.

The number of babies expected per woman fell to 0.78 last year, according to data released by the statistics office on Wednesday. At 0.81 in 2021, it was already the lowest among more than 260 nations tracked by the World Bank.

The lack of babies carries long-term risks for the economy by reducing the size of the workforce that underpins its growth and vitality. Welfare spending for an aging population also drains national coffers that could otherwise be utilized to promote businesses, research and other enterprises that are key to prosperity.

Do you really think that any of those companies actually got involved in this mess? That’s not how it works. The money made in a sale wouldn’t benefit any of those companies directly. It would be the buyer and the seller who stand to gain the most. Plus anyone they can pay off to make the sale happen.

She’s doing this to continue the grift of her supporters. There are probably emails being sent out that the election was rigged and “true patriots” need to donate to help. She will do this for like another month or so then fall off the face of the earth when she realizes the hype died down.

Of course it won't get better. The House is a republican-filled circus and most of their platform was crafted on a whim for the optics. They want to muddy the water so that the actions of the Trump administration and the republican party that stood by him somehow seem less egregious. Most of their so-called platform are non-starters for democrats, so what you are left with is gridlock and optics votes, and that's what the next 2 years are going to be.

That's why he's been leaning into the more extreme right crowd and pandering to authoritarians (see: his comments attacking Khashoggi).

Yeah the fault is the security and not the pro Trump rioters. Methinks Pompeo also blames female rape victims for not defending their virtue better.

He knows full well he's lying, there's no way even Pompeo is this thick. But he still views himself as a possible GQP presidential nominee and, barring that, at least able to pitch his new book and make a decent little chunk of change.

I think he's also one of those end-of-days believers who thinks we can and should hasten the apocalypse so the rapture can happen.

He's been angling for thus for years, hosting "Madison Dinners" at the Dept of State that he said were about having conversations with all kinds of people and helping him as Sec of State. Really it was conservative donors and stars he wanted to add to his donor list.

The only thing the handful of officers on site could’ve done was to open up with lethal ammunition earlier. That’s not an option i through I would have ever been supportive of but on the 6th I absolutely thought they should have. Those police were hung out to dry by Trump and his gang of thugs.

Seriously. Degrading your naval fleet in a land war is on par with losing the emu war to the emus or civil war reenactors suffering more casualties at the reenactment than the actual battle.
They had to pull back or else land units will hit them relentlessly. A ship being attacked by land targets it's not designed to fight is at a serious disadvantage. It's clear that Ukrainians are able to pose a significant threat to the fleet judging by the Moskva.

Come on man, they don't park ships there. The Black Sea fleet has been active for almost 250 years. Plus, where else would you sail them to? The North Sea? Good luck attacking Ukraine from there.

There was one, I'm trying to find the article. But it was in Texas or South Carolina and they were reenacting a battle at the end of the war where the armies found out the war ended before the battle started. Some civil war reenactor had a heart attack running across the field. It was in a Dave Barry column a few years ago.

For all intents and purposes they are parking ships there. A navy without mobility is useless. And they are basically immobile. They're not allowed to pass through the Dardanelles. And as Ukrainians get higher range weapons and advance westward, they are increasingly hemmed in until they basically have to stay in port to be protected. And at that point, why even build hugely expensive mobile warships?

The Black Sea fleet' primary focus has mostly been defending the southern naval approach to Russia from a NATO attack through the Dardanelle straight. This would in turn put the Russian fleet in the defensive sphere of their own land-based anti-ship missiles.

With Turkey joining NATO in 1947, Russia has been forced to maintain this fleet. One might say even since the signing of the treaty of Montreux in '36, continually forcing manpower and material away from the Pacific and Baltic fleet. I agree that it has proven mostly irrelevant in the Ukrainian conflict, but that is mostly because its not built around it.

Building hugely, expensive mobile warships is exactly what you want to do in the case you win the NATO conflict in the Black Sea and wish to project it further in to the Mediterranean.

Just to be clear, I do not support or endorse the attack by Russia on Ukraine nor support the Russian regime.

But that's not what they're up against. The last thing it should have faced is a determined land based Ukrainian combat situation. The fleet isn't designed for that. The irony is they prepared for a war that isn't happening while ignoring the biggest threat possible to the fleet. Pissed off Ukrainians.

Yeah, no, there is literally no other place for them to be. Turkiye would never let them leave and would never let any other ship enter during wartime. They're trapped in the Black Sea.
This is pretty weak even by the standards of Lawrence Tribe. I think he’s trying to make the argument that because Ginni Thomas used a version of the Independent State Legislature theory when encouraging people in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin to throw out presidential election results, it means she somehow has a legal interest in a case where the North Carolina legislature contends that the ISL theory prevents a state court from throwing out a gerrymandered congressional map and drawing its own congressional map. But Ginni Thomas has nothing to do with this case, and hasn’t had any involvement with this case.

Once developing countries catch up with the west, we are all fucked. I went to Iraq last year and the consumerism is off the charts. So much China plastic junk all around.
It took us decades of hard work to change the mindsets. So it'll probably get worse before it gets better.

Yup, we had a short window to course correct ourselves and society before we exported our lifestyle to the rest of the world but instead we spread it like a cancer. If we had solved a lot of these issues like rampant consumerism and obsolescence we'd be in much better place. Instead we build products to break. Each product takes energy to create, from trucks to ship them, from factories keeping lights on plus the cost to bury it a year later because they designed it so the battery can't replaced even though every other part on the product works perfectly.

We (as in Europe/NA) really take pollution and littering relatively seriously too. I traveled around West Africa in November and people just throw plastic trash like bottles and water in plastic bags out of car windows. There's plastic and other trash everywhere just dumped on the streets.

It’s because they don’t truly believe in free speech. They believe in their speech. Yelling “free speech” just gives them a way to try to play victim.

It’s the same as their yelling about “sanctuary Sanctity of marriage”. They don’t give a shit about marriage. They just want to make sure gay people can’t have it too.

They can't bypass that. If you want to be listed in Apple's app store, you agree to their terms. Musk may not like that, but he can't do anything about it. Apple isn't worried about Musk's threats.

Yes, in the real world we understand this (and a few of the whiners may as well). However that's not the issue at hand, since this is about the violation they are making up.

Nothing in that has anything to do with this falsified claim. Congress made no law telling Apple to take it down, there ARE no first amendment protections in this situation.

In reality, this is just more fascist bluster to see if they can get Apple to cave ahead of time, so they don't have to look silly by either doing nothing because they dont want to risk the court case, or by actually deciding to go full FAFO and truly violate the 1st by trying to force Apple to carry specific apps.

Twitter and Apple are not being subjected to laws limiting their ability to say or do things, let alone the fact that they are companies operating on private servers so 1st amendment protections would not apply even if they were being held lawfully responsible for removing content from their servers (which, again, they aren't), regardless of how much fascists whine about being held accountable for their words and actions.

Doesn't apply in cases like this where the actions are being applied on private servers, so I'm guessing it's somewhere in their lower abdomen, right next to their heads. Enter through the exit to get there, as is typical with ass backwards fascist reasoning.

I'm simply saying their claims of Apple violations are false. If they actually try to force Apple to do anything, they are going to enter FAFO territory.

While Musk would actually be dumb enough to try, he can't actually force anything. DeSantis is just spewing shit trying to get fascist voters attention, per usual. I doubt he views this as much more than a publicity stunt, like pretty much anything he does. Think Martha's Vineyard without the human trafficking 'issues'. Good red meat for yall queda.
Many people in Germany claimed after the war that they didn't know what was happening to all the jews, yet at the same time Goebbels was able to find enough people to cheer to his "wollt ihr den totalen Krieg" speech and people on the outside (or smarter people on the inside) didn't know how that could be. I think we see that again here... The grim reality is propaganda works. If the only language you understand is Russia (Insert any language here really) and your only Information is government controlled bullshit, you soak it up when you just suck at critical thinking, which unfortunately is a brain function of higher order that develops very late if at all. Many people are simply born to be just part of a herd, follow instructions blindly and don't question anything. Gullibility is as much a human trait as enlightenment, maybe even the default.
There is a cultural affliction in Russia that we just don’t understand, it’s something in the lines of: I don’t give a shit about any one else, and they won’t give a shit about me. They don’t care about some else at all and just want to fly under the radar. It’s a thing that’s been this way for a long time because of the regimes that’s been in place there for so long.

I'm not being very nuanced actually. I really am saying that it is a cultural issue that as far as I can tell goes back hundreds if not thousands of years. Russians see their land and culture as something that must be preserved 100% at all costs. This is not how the universe works. Fuck em, let's change them for them.
But if Iran attacks SaudiArabia we are first to defend them? After the Saudis sided with Putin on oil cuts they are cosing up to Xi, time to re asses WHO is not our ally any longer based on the OBVIOUS.
The American administration wouldn’t have done what they did if they didn’t consider potential consequences and the Saudi administration wouldn’t be doing what it is doing for no reason. Based off the Americans recent actions it seems they are more concerned with the pacific and revitalizing it’s homeland. It’s entirely possible the Americans no longer care and the Saudi Arabians are trying to goad the Americans back into caring or they may be courting China as an alternative in the event the Americans actually don’t care anymore. I do doubt China will waste money and military assets abroad defending Saudi Arabia though. Things are definitely changing.

The USA is making moves to bring manufacturing and certain other industries back home. Some of these moves come to the detriment of Allies and have Europe, Japan and Korea side eyeing us. America is clearly focusing inward, how far it goes, who knows. But the Saudi Arabia’s of the world wouldn’t be making these moves for nothing.

Naaa China imports most of its energy resources. They need the Saudis for their sweet sweet oil. The Saudis and China need the US to guarantee free passage of shipping. China has a huge fleet but very few ships are capable of blue water force protection over the distances needed to secure their oil supplies. Saudi also needs a guaranteed of their security. Their war against the Houthi’s have proven they are a mediocre military power despite all the hardware they buy. If a rival power like Iran decided to mix it up with the Saudis they’d roll them without our protection.

The US does not need Saudi in the long run. We can make our own energy. We stick around to ensure the price of oil stays stable for our allies in Europe. But that is probably going to change after the war in Ukraine is over.

Look at how American left a certain part of the Middle East abruptly without even notifying some key allies ahead of time. I don’t think there’s any guarantee the USA will continue to do some of the things it has done in the past. Especially for free.. some allies may be on there own depending on who they are.

Is that why Japan and Korea signed the RCEP deal along with China? Would you further integrate your economy with someone you see as a sworn enemy? Japan and Korea will not cross any line unless China does first, China hasn’t even gone towards Taiwan yet. I wouldn’t expect any hard help from japan or Korea unless they are directly hit by something.

Once Ukraine finishes dismantling the Russian army then the calculus in Europe will change. If the Russian Federation breaks up (which looks very likely) then Europe might find itself having to guarantee its own security.

Japan and Korea are not interested in being the stage for a battle that would lead to world war 3 and will probably do everything in their power to remain neutral with an obvious tilt towards America. But they are not gonna risk all that damage on command from America unless the first strike comes externally. It makes more since for them to play a balancing act. After all they are not owned by America.

Never said they didn’t align with America. I merely said neither is interested in a war in their backyard unless it absolutely has to happen. Therefore they may trend towards neutrality on certain issues, which they do.

With signs pointing to America focusing more inward, it’s likely conflict scenarios would decrease anyhow unless a key resource like chips was disrupted. However China seems to be making progress on its own in that field and America is also working towards that, if the Americans are self sufficient, outside of key issues why bother interfering in a battle that would lead to nukes?

I don’t see China making any moves that would trigger them too unless China feels it is ready to deal with America on a peer level. Hence, I don’t see China making a move to provoke Japan or Korea. In other words on economics and certain.

Saudi Arabia tries to raise gasoline prices before the American midterm elections, in order to strenhen the Republicans and weaken the Democratic party. This is a strategic move, because the Republican parties have been much more beholden to the oil industry and Saudi Arabia over the past 50 years.

Saudi Arabia is attempting to align themselves with the other fossil fuel producers, and any nation which pushes for a lower oil. Consuming future is an enemy of the Saudi state. Recently, this is included the United States under Joe Biden.

While I agree with your premise. I’d like to point out that China history of printing currency makes Jpow “printers go burr” look like an amateur. China devalues their currency to keep the export machine rolling. China also can’t keep Saudi safe. They can’t project force at nearly the scale the US can.

Finally look at our currency as a store of value. We are the only major economic power that has raised interest rates significantly in the face of rampant inflation. China, E.U. Etc can’t as they are facing economic and demographic crises. No sane country will adopt a currency that is going to devalue itself.

The Saudi Arabian government knows that they are losing prestige and influence worldwide, and thus they feel compelled to tie themselves publicly to China. They would not do this unless they found themselves in a position of such weakness that they would want to get tied to the Chinese government.

At the international level, everyone knows that you don't get in bed with China unless you want to get fucked. No one comes out of a business deal with China happy about it. Most major nations are actively moving away from China, because they have experience what it is to be fucked by the Chinese, and they don't want any more of that.

So, observe the Saudis moving closer to China, and understand that they are doing this because they are weak, and they are growing so desperate that even being under the chinese's influence is preferable to their status quo.

If you want to cite me the studies that show that magazine bans have any effect on mass shootings, I’d be more than happy to believe that. But, as it stands, no such data exists. Magazine swaps take me, a beginner shooter, 2.6 seconds to complete (last time I did magswap drills at the range.) Trying to limit magazine capacity is NOT going to lower body counts.

Magazine capacity bans are nothing but political theater. Stopping mass shootings HAS to come down to stopping the spread of fascism, which continues to inspire the vast majority of mass shooting attacks.

I hate this framing. The magazine capacity limitations were an afterthought of this bill. The REAL danger in it is allowing Oregon’s notoriously racist state police force to have complete control over who is issued the required gun licenses with no oversight or authority to keep them in check.

When the Gestapo drags me and all of my trans sisters to the gulag, I’ll be sure to mention that one time my opinion was close to an NRA talking point. I’m sure that’ll get me off the hook.

They absolutely can, but the process needs to be put in place for it. The processes and systems for the approved training, the database for those permits, and the systems for accessing them. It isn't a magic flip a switch and it's on place. It will take a few months, probably six to twelve to get into place. It also will cost a few million probably. In the mean time, without the judge putting it on hold gun sales are banned on Oregon.

Let's be real: this judge is from a county that's 10,000 square miles (larger than 6 US states) and holds 7500 people and 2 'cities' (the largest one being 3000 people). It's practically empty. If you fire off a gun with a high-capacity magazine out there you're just going to hit a bunch of cows and trees.

But the law right now is completly unconstitutional as written. It is essentially a full ban on gun sales. All firearm sales need a permit, but there was no provision for time to set that up, or a budget for it. We need him control, but this law was possibly the worst execution of it. It is so bad I was thinking someone on the far right wrote it knowing it wouldn't pass, and if it did the court would stop it. But they did something for gun control.

Registration when permits are available isn't a ban at all. There are no permits that is the difference. Without the judge putting it on hold this is a ban of all gun sales until there is a process. That is the problem. That is what breaks it completely.

Most Presidential prospects delay filing as long as they can because they're under much stricter rules for fundraising and reporting once they're official candidates.

Couldn't agree more. Personally I think Trump only declared so early because it would afford him a degree of protection from prosecution. Dragging a retired golf cart warmer into court is one thing, dragging an active presidential candidate is quite another.

He's not serious, no touring or rallies, no hobnobbing with Kingmakers, he hasn't even hired any campaign staff yet.

Compare that to his last run which I still believe he didn't want to win either and there's no work happening. He gambled and lost by winning a presidency he never wanted and now he needs the same political clout that keeps Matt Gaetz out of jail (while getting his co-conspirator convicted).
You’re ignoring the tax rebate received that covers shelter, food, etc. and actually reduces the tax burden on lower income families who spend most of their income. This comes as a monthly payment of a certain amount made to households. There’s also no tax on used goods including clothes and vehicles. It’s not as straightforward as that but could be a progressive solution. It’s akin to taxing wages and wealth. Most of the super rich aren’t paying income tax as they don’t do traditional work so avoid paying like the rest of us. It would tax purchases of the rich and make tax evasion nearly impossible. Tourists and those making money illegally also contribute to the tax base, spreading the tax base. I respect that you don’t support it and your concerns are valid, but reading the full bill may help alleviate some concerns.

Tbh tho the more I read about the nutty putty guy the more I dont feel bad for him. Dont get me wrong its a terrible, terrible way to go for him. But he had a pregnant fiance at home, hadnt gone caving in years, goes to a more difficult cave a couple weeks before his wedding, doesnt properly know the layout of the cave enough and yet he pushed through a unknown spot, and we all know the rest of the story.
I cant think of a more polite way to say that i didnt feel bad for him because it makes me seem like a huge asshole, but there was just so many things this guy could of done to prevent this, not to mention just not doing it, or going to an easier cave, and now theres a greiving widow with a child on the way becsuse this guy didnt stop and think of the consequences for a second.

Yes and also if doing pour over for grinds, if you make it thick it (edit: this it being the appropriate temp range instead of boiling temp) also lets you still get more cups out of it since you don’t overextract and breakdown flavor in the first or first few pour throughs - still need to do them immediately though.

It's a victory for DOJ, but Trump got three months delay, to after the midterms and his declaration to run for President again. Now there is an additional Special Counsel layer to delay even more.

I’d say even more. Having grown up in the south with eligibility to join the Daughters of the Confederacy, most people who flew it 20 years ago didn’t even think of racism. It was pride for where they came from and mourning the general loss of the thin veneer of “Southern genteel life” fantasized about in days gone by. It literally didn’t occur to them that it could be seen as racist. Some people only got a clue when a Black person told them what that flag meant to them. Some people still don’t get it. Usually because they’re morons who don’t get a lot of things. And, yeah, some are outright racist, just as our Confederate ancestors intended.

> - Based on a Maamar of the Lubavitch Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, it is learned that meditation and prayer, while spiritually transformative, do not match the power of doing business ethically (Padah B’Shalom, 5739). The Admor of Belz, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, in discussing the angels descending and ascending on the ladder seen in the dream of Ya'akov, notes that the gematria value of sulam, ladder, is equivalent to that of kesef, money. The teaching here is that while a few are able to ascend spiritually in the way they earn and spend their money others, instead, descend here.
44 “‘Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. 45 You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. 46 You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
It was a common colonial tactic used against native peoples of America, Canada, and Australia, and probably other countries but I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of the oppression of native peoples so someone else is going to have to chime in with what I am sure are many additions to this list.
Move em to Russia, then move Russian families into homes in occupied territories. They did it to Japan and others before, and it's all about holding the areas for a generation or two when they can argue that the only living people who still has ties to the occupied territories are Russians.

Edit: As I predicted several examples below. I didn't predict a correction that Canada did this into the motherfucking NINETIES. Point being it by no means was a tactic abandoned after the Renaissance, nor only used by "raiding tribes." It remained into the modern era and was used by so-called "civilized" nations.
I'd expect that all the defense company lobbyists have been talking the ears off of anyone in Congress about how important it is to keep supporting Ukraine.
This war has be double-Christmas in July for the military industrial complex in the USA. They've been getting to try out all their latest weapon systems in a war against a peer-level adversary. (Though Russia hasn't given nearly as good a showing as we would have expected in 2021.) I judge this for many reasons, not the least of which I keep getting contacts from various defense industry recruiters.

So there is likely a lot of, maybe not "pressure", but "influence" to keep the war going behind the scenes.

However, they can use the data on how Russia deals with these 20+ year old weapons systems to make modern US weapon systems even more efficient and lethal, without ever showing the Russians the capability of our newest systems. It is effectively a one way information exchange.

McCarthy has already said there would be no more Ukrainian aid when he’s speaker. Now he’s too weak to actually enforce that in his caucus but support for Ukraine is not a mainstream bipartisan issue.
The way it reads to me seems pretty specific to loans (“requirements”) and the student financial assistance programs. I’m looking at the actual law now. You’re right, people can read this and argue over what exactly was meant for each and every potential case, just like any other law. But I don’t think it’s broad… here, see for . To me, that’s pretty specific and seems to fall right in line with the EdSec’s arguments to allow this go forward. I honestly think the only way to attack this is for the Supreme Court to reeeeaaaallly step all over a co-equal branch of the government. This law was introduced in the house, by the power of the purse, and sailed right through the senate without amendments and landed on the presidents desk. COVID has killed more Americans than any attack on our country ever, and all people experienced hardship (and still are). The law was meant for a moment like this, so it would be fed up for the Supreme Court to intervene.

The Soviets fell due to spending more on military than the economy could support and Putin repeats the error. Magnifies it by simultaneously losing the Ukraine war and spending scarce resources on redundant weapons for war that will never be fought.

The cold cyber war is about affecting social value by manipulation of data and facts, replacing social value with currency in the form of crypto, the intangible assets that are easily manipulated because it allows the criminals and foreign agents to launder currencies.

There is no constitutional amendment protecting children from being exploited in the market place- there was one proposed in 1924 but only 6 states ratified it meaning it is still pending after nearly 100 years.

The second part is that these fines are simply cheaper than the cost of paying livable wages and as long as no one is personally held liable it is more profitable for businesses to continue these practices.
If I were in the Kremlin I'd be a lot more worried about how very few of Russia's neighbors seem motivated to care about it's wellbeing than I would be over reforging the USSR of old.
They've bailed on Armenia, spooked Belarus, caused Kazakhstan to distance itself from them, convinced Sweden and Finland to join NATO and whatever Ukraine looks like after this conflict, they're almost certainly going to join as well.

They've never cared about Russia's wellbeing before, why start now? Russia can be useful to authoritarian dictators who need someone with a decent-sized army to kick the shit out of protesters, but other than that, it's like living next door to a flop house. If you're lucky, they'll just be noisy, if you're unlucky, the junkies next door will break into your house and steal your shit when you're not home, if you're really unlucky, they'll decide they like your house better than theirs and just move in. But at no point will you ever be glad that they're there, nor would you ever mourn their passing.

In their mind prolonging the war to (somehow) "win" is their tactic of motivating their neighbors to care.
We're really not, though. You would need every person in the launch chain to be suicidally crazy. It's not just like the president of the US or putin can just unilaterally declare they want to do a first strike, they'd have to get everyone in the chain to go along with that. Soviet missile base commanders have refused the order in the past on more than one occasion.

Except that we have literal proof of this not being the case when it comes to nuclear weapons, in living memory, during the most brutal periods of the post ww2 soviet union, which was as close to a cult of personality as you could get.

They don't give a fuck about the impact of their agenda. The only thing they care about it pulling the wool over Republican voters' eyes to prevent them from seeing the pick-pocketing thieves we call "donors". Same thing with abortion and guns. Anyone who thinks stopping abortion, opposing gun control, or fighting LGBT communities are worthy causes is a massive fucking rube. Let our country deteriorate while you clutch your tacticool gun, happy you no longer have to use the proper pronoun or see guys kissing on TV. That's about the extent of eudaimonia you're going to get with conservative ideology.
Fuck that. This isn’t about hijab. It’s about women being beaten to death for breaking a ‘morality’ law. It’s about women (and men) being arrested and raped, beaten, whipped, shocked, tortured so badly they need medical care and being denied that. It’s about having a 10 minute trial, without a lawyer and being sentenced to death by hanging. It’s about them being lifted by a crane so that they slowly (20-30 minutes) suffocate to death. It’s about their tortured and murdered bodies being buried in secret or held for ransom by the police. It’s about families being threatened with the safety of the family if they say how how a family member was killed/died.

I'm pretty sure the Iranian people aren't completely fixated on just the issue of the hijab? I'm thinking they question the entire theocratic hold over their lives and the inability to live those lives without sanction for incidental infractions of harsh interpretations of Islamic law?

It's obvious the mullah's desire power and control over their people and they intend on maintaining that control at any cost. The suffering of the people under their charge is not even a concern.

But it all comes down to the evil, greedy, weak men in control thinking of themselves as Gods. If you speak out against what is happening in Iran or wanting to be free of the Islamic regime you are arrested for moharebeh, ‘waging war against God’. Yes, moharebeh is punishable by death.

New York Post reported that the group that targeted Bottcher’s office is called Guardians of Divinity. Well let's see... They are either MMORPG fans... or religious fanatics. I am guessing the latter.

It's by design. The first wave of fascism actually had a lot of backing by a class of fascist "intellectuals," afluent and educated extremelly conservative individuals developing fascist theories and extablishing the ideology from 19th century racial "science" and ideas of nationalism, this made fascism more appealing to aristocratic/business classes across the world, which feared the specter of socialist movements.
Modern far right ideology is more populist, anti-intelectual, and reactionary than first wave fascist ideology.

3. GOP didn’t lose as much as for the 2nd time in 2 years, Warnock overcame the GOP machine and won this race. He’s a winner and if he chooses to one day, I could see him doing very well if he decided to run for POTUS. Doesn’t mean he’s the perfectly ideological ally for me, but he just survived a tsunami of personal attack ads and negative GOP campaigning that was nonstop and vicious. I live in Tennessee but close enough to GA that my airwaves were bombarded with it. The fact that Warnock emerged relatively unscathed says a lot about him as a future possibility.

and I would never pick an Airhead like Nikki Haley ok, never pick her, she's way too close to the Radical Left, and she's pretending to be nice to me with words quite frankly, we've had nothing but problems when she was around, she's almost as bad as Sleepy Joe, not as bad as Obama, but you all know what I'm talking about, we had nothing in terms of Scandals under Trump, I gave you all many many Beautiful Days, we had no problems. and just the other day I was talking to a friend, very famous, very rich, not as rich as me but we're talking a lot, and he said to me, "Sir, you've done more than even The Pope," The Pope, he liked me a lot, said I was way better for the World than Obama, way way better, so much more than Sleepy Joe. don't forget, I got rid of Comey, got rid of Taxes, we were basically at 100%, probably more, who knows, but then here comes Crazy Nancy and Crying Chuck Schumer, who has more Fake Tears than anybody, and they're wanting to let everyone use your Bathroom whenever they want, it's a complete and total disgrace. and don't worry, you can send money now, send it later, do all of it, it's not a problem, just make sure that you're treating me fairly and thanking me for my Beautiful Service.

I think it's not just that their confessions, but also convenient excuses. Half the time Trump spoke about it, he spoke about it in some reverant manner almost like he was asking people to cheat for him.

I personally don't believe that either of these cases warrant prison time, but there's a pretty significant difference in the two. Provisional ballots literally exist for these edge cases where validity or whatever is in question. You take the provisional ballot and, if after extra scrutiny it checks out, it's added to the tally.

Rosa Ortega cast several regular ballots after incorrectly (fraudulently) certifying that she was eligible to do so.

Ortega lied about being a citizen to vote. The notion that she was following advice of a parole officer to do so is news to me; source?

Based on some Excel magic from NBC's county by county breakdown and % vote remaining, Dems only need \60% of remaining Clark and Washoe counties to win, which seems pretty doable being that the remaining ballots are mail-in which skew Democrat because republicans aren't smart enough to vote by mail.

Masto is actually performing slightly better now without the outstanding ballots than in 2016 (an election year) WITH the ballots. Maybe I’m missing something, but even if the race is close, I don’t see how Masto loses this.
What if someone forced Islam onto your kids? Or forced them to get a tattoo? All of this shit is pretty irreversible, right? Indoctrination of religion at a young age tends to stick, and you can’t really reverse a tattoo. How egotistical do you need to be to think you know better for someone else’s child than their own parents? They really think LGBTQ people are forcing queerness onto their kids, when in reality, the community knows all too well just how difficult it is to be in the community and probably don’t want that for their kids. Not to mention, they know what it’s like to have shit forced on them and how damaging that is.

Kaczyński is as morbid as ever in his hatred against Germany. It will do German-Polish relations a great deal of good when he eventually kicks the bucket.
Nothing to see here, just a conservative politician being a conservative politician and spewing nonsense. The article says that the majority of the Polish population does not agree with him on his stance towards Germany.

Unlike trumpets in US, PiS voter base is not entirely demented. They keep voting on them mostly for two reasons - a) they keep giving out money to people via various social programs and keep promising new batches of it every voting season, and b) they are very pro-Catholic and keep targeting them as voters. Despite that less and less people are going to church, there is still a lot of Catholics in Poland and the Church keeps promoting PiS as a party that should be voted on (cause PiS keeps giving the Church money and land). Can't say I agree with them, but y'all need to understand that conservatives in Poland are not the same as in US.
The CCP for years has been willing to give out high interest loans to all the countries that the U.S. likes to forget about. From Latin America to Africa, Pakistan and Cambodia, they all received lots of that 10x Chinese Yuan, which allows China massive amounts of leverage over everything from raw materials supply chain, to building a military base and calling it a “port”.
But for nearly 20 years China has been willing to produce a $40 part (if it was made in the US) for $4. It’s not that it somehow magically costs that much less to build in China, it’s that the CCP basically Nationalizes any company large enough to make a difference. Xi realized that Americas appetite for cheap shit is insatiable. In fact our entire economy demands that we buy 3-7% more shit every year or the wheels fall off the bus. The entire economic policy as written and managed by the federal reserve is predicated on this growth.

Circa 2012 xi proclaimed “I will control the internet” and no one really took him seriously. He was relatively unknown at the time and China was frankly not the juggernaut that it is now.

And it’s not even a particularly novel play. The 2014 invasion of the donbas via “little green men” taking over local business and government was effective because of minor misdirect. The US intelligence community has been hyper focused on the Middle East for 20 years. And since the legalization of marijuana at a state level (colorado, California, Oregon etc) it has become nearly impossible for them to fulfill their recruitment numbers. ANY federally illegal drug use automatically disqualifies a young candidate and all the grey beards retired.

On the Chinese side the CCP doesn’t exactly have an objective auditor to cross check their books. So if the yuan is let’s say, 1000 to the USD or 10,000 to the USD, it doesn’t really matter if you are taking a long approach. You simply turn the money printing machines up to 10, nationalize any domestic Chinese business that can be used for control, and place an agent of the CCP in the C suite offices of any multinational company that does business in China.

Xi had a very ambitious plan called “made in China 2025” that would basically culminate this “investment” in slave labor and locking up supply chain.

The reason world trade is measured in USD is simply because the U.S. military industrial complex won WW2 and the victor writes the rules. It was no different for the Roman’s or the Greeks in the past.

But in order for it all to work, Xi still has to make the Yuan take over the USD. And his clock is ticking. Local level corruption inside China has turned into Xi’s nemesis. From the housing industry that builds homes no one can afford (evergreen) to the time honored tradition of stacking all the materials at the front door of a warehouse and telling everyone it’s full to the brim, corruption is the bain of the CCP’s existence. In the first half of this year it forced xi to issue nearly $100B worth of provincial bonds just to try and keep it all together.

Covid is testing it even farther. Most of Xi’s platform is built on the belief that only he and he alone can make these decisions for 1.4B Chinese. But that starts to breakdown when they start asking why they have been welded into their apartments eating rotten vegetables for 3 years while everyone else is drinking beer at the soccer World Cup.

Xi has had to build an absolute Goliath machine of intelligence called the MSS. The Chinese version of the CIA but MUCH larger. For 1.4B people he has had to build an army of censors t surveil and censor comments on weibo, the only state allowed social media platform.

If Xi had Taiwan (where 90% of those chips are made) he could divert them from ford to his own AI project and simultaneously starve out the US economy and build his surveillance and censorship empire and effectively “control the internet”. It’s why Huawei is willing to undercut any and all other vendors to install their 5G towers at a loss. And it’s why tik tok has a different algorithm for the West that essentially incentivizes a 3 minute attention span and harvests data from absolutely everywhere.

Early Covid taught us that the US economy runs on semiconductors. From the chips in Raytheon’s bombs to the seat heaters in ford trucks, Facebook to your 401k, the US economy relies on those sweet cheap processors for virtually everything. And whoever controls the supply, would effectively be the puppet master.

Russia on the other hand is a mafia state. Nothing happens unless the hands at the top get greased. It’s why Putin has amassed $200B in net worth while making less than $200k a year on paper.

In august US congress passed a $50B CHIPS act to bring all that manufacturing back stateside. Because the never ending drive for cheaper shit made us willing to overlook the slavery, pollution and corruption that drove it to China decades ago.

With all of the absolute bollocks (and associated political and economic stuff) that's been going on in recent years, I'd be utterly unsurprised to learn that world governments have known about an extinction level asteroid that is on its way, for a while, and that all of this shit is because they are secretly scrambling to grab shit to build massive underground lifeboats for not us.

Russia always loses alot of soldiers when they go to war. Whether it's losing to Germany in WW1, struggling against Finland, winning agai st Germany in WW2 but still losing a gargantuan amount of men, their war in Afghanistan, against Chechnya, and so on. Whether Russia wins or loses, high casualties is just how Russia does war.
The amazingly depressing thing is that this is likely the reason that Russians have such dysfunctional relationships both between themselves and between themselves & the rest of the world. Kind of hard to value anyone else's life and problems when you're struggling to survive an uncaring, sociopathic regime's pointless war.

Russia could have been an economic monster but like most of the world, greed and self interest rules. It will always get worse in Russia now that they are past the point of no return. Maybe in 500 years they will dig their way out but for the near future Russia is dog shit.

I suspect the Czars think that invading (again) in the winter would mean that they are not stuck using roads and lining up a 50km long A10 Hog pilots wet dream. Czar Putin made the mistake of waiting until Emperor Jinping gave him permission to invade - the Emperor did not want his Olympics disturbed. That was the price to pay. Emperor Jinping only agreed to supporting Czar Putin's invasion on the condition Russia also supported glorious China's invasion of Taiwan which was scheduled but cancelled. Waiting for the Olympics to conclude meant the Czars army would have to use roads and get slaughtered.

Would it be too much to ask that the US donates a handful of older A-10s to Ukraine just in case the Czar sends another long line of cannon fodder. I am certain the old dudes that designed and sold the A-10 (50 years ago) thought of exactly the scenario we witnessed. Where the Czar railroads ended they would have to use road and be eradicated. I wonder if the ancient A-10 has a way to slow down the rate of fire so they can erase many kilometers of the Czars cannon fodder.
Batshit Republicans had the country running in a positive flourishing manner. Can’t have that. Let’s keep inflation at all time highs, let’s beg our enemies for oil instead of being energy independent, let’s let the border remain open so the flow of fentanyl, human trafficking, child abuse child trafficking, can keep flowing with the cartels in control, and terrorists from other countries running free, let’s keep crime and murder in the inner cities at all time high levels, let’s keep letting China be profitable, while removing all manufacturing out of America, let’s keep withdrawing troops from war torn areas and leave citizens behind as well as terrorists in charge of the country with death to Americans, let’s not be able to by food any more, or gas, and for sure let’s keep promoting EV so when the battery gives out we can run to the nearest charging center for a bucket of electricity, let’s keep touting climate change as a problem as if the climate has never changed before. The list is endless. Let’s not make America great again. Which should be the motto of the Left.

It’s not just his media background, he’s not just some puppet milling about he’s displayed true leadership, I’d argue the kind found once a decade. I sincerely hope that he either has or finds the wisdom to keep things going until the war ends and even past that, to forge a truly permeant new state.
I think it's valuable for us to remember how many young people are on here, some even interested in current events. They won't always have learned the proper academic definitions of things yet, and have to go by looser, more pop-culture understandings.

We're going to make much more progress as a species when we use our knowledge as a resource to share, instead perceiving it as something that makes us better than others.

Everyone is kinda free-wheeling like that when they're young, as people get older they usually get lazier about wanting to jump in and participate like that. Given how much free time most kids get, and how alluring the no-restrictions nature of online discourse can be at that age, I like my odds.
FOOTBALL fans at the World Cup have reportedly been pictured jumping over security fences outside of the Al-Thumama stadium. Footage taken next to the stadium appears to show fans outside of the Canada vs Morocco game being refused entry into the ground by security personnel. The stadium closure comes despite many fans in the queue holding tickets to enter. In the video the police can be seen trying to intervene to resolve the situation but with large amounts of fans also not holding valid tickets it has caused big delays in getting spectators into the ground. And with crowd tension spilling over after the security barriers were lowered, some jumped over the barriers in a bid to get into the ground.

It was appalling to hear the Nepali worker who said he was forced to work without rest on 52C hot days. The number of fatalities officially reported is 37 - which is laughable & on-your-face lie. And FIFA is worse than IOC when it comes to bribery & corruption..If Kim Jong Un gave the right price I won't be surprised they'll host 2038 FIFA in NK.

And on top of that, this protestor decided to use it not in self defense but to shoot at police. The cops didnt even have body cam because they probably werent expecting to have issues dealing with protestors, much less getting shot at.

The Louis Theroux documentary really shows this whole right wing influencer set (Fuentes, Baked Alaska, the beard-themed guy with a patchy beard whose name is cant recall) for a group of half witted emotionally stunted weirdos with horrendous and poorly thought out reactionary views. It's shocking to me that any adult takes them seriously. Their worldview is insane and prejudicial in the extreme, and that's enough, but i think it's underrated the extent to which their implied policy would wreck the American economy for at least a generation.

The large amounts of economic migrant deaths are attributable less to el muro and more to the total lack of mass transit within Mexico, let alone safe and dignified transit. Mexico eliminated it's passenger trains when it privatized their network in '94 to join NAFTA. This immediately destroyed all towns built upon the railroad, destroyed all heavy industries not purchased by Americans, and shoved millions onto an extremely incapable road network. It is one of the largest drivers of systematic inequality in Mexico. Mexico's current President is trying to rebuild it, but how far he gets is ultimately up to Americans.

I don't say this to be dismissive about the death - imagine a world where Mexicans could safely travel through Mexico and into the US in a way that could verify their identity, verify their employment status, and ensure their wages are not stolen. Mexico would be a safer place, America would be a richer place, and people wouldn't risk their lives like this. Right now the situation is so bad they'd risk dying like this.

This will be especially important in the decades to come, with so many equatorial and tropical areas becoming barely habitable for decades more (best case).

Tropical areas will still be inhabitable, but will be polluted and won't have any nature. Ocean/air acidification, not the least due to AMLO re-allowing sulfurated diesel which will destroy most of the ecology as industrialized urban areas expand. It's central Mexico that will get too hot, and that's where all of Mexico's industry and civilization are. Major new infrastructure is needed for this and it's debatable if the Mexican state can handle the task.

I’m not sure this means they can’t win the next Presidential election depending on the candidates? It may provoke some in fighting with being a trump loving election denier having been more successful , in general, in nomination than election? And the possibility of a Trump and DeSantis grudge match? I guess a lot depends on the economy , whether Biden runs again as age takes it’s toll and if not whether the Democrats can find a convincing replacement?

When asked about the information of the British intelligence about possible Russian advance to the Bakhmut – Kostiantynivka highway, Cherevatyi answered that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are indeed trying to gain control over this area, but there is a counter-battery fight in order to reduce the Russians' ability to hit the highway.

They have to save face. They have to gain something. To make real gains tho Ukraine has to stop pushing back, which they won't any time soon. Russia offered peace for the annexed territories... (Could have been a ruse idk) and Ukraine refused.

My concern is they are drawing in troops along the front so they can make their offensive(s) elsewhere in hopes of surrounding the entire Ukranian army (in the east). How relaistic that is, is probably speculation on Russia's part.

This war reached passed point of no return that each side has to win to be seen as the good side with no crime while losing side will be persecuted. It truly is fighting for the survival of each country as losing side country has a high chance of breakup (whether from war or later internal power struggle). A war we still reference 100 years from today significance.

In history we usually call that a victory. All borders everywhere were once contested. Just look at the history of the Southern US and Mexico, they stopped where they agreed the new borders would be and have had peace ever since.

Joe Manchin’s latest idea is reminiscent of the bipartisan “super committee” created in the deal to raise the debt limit in 2011. That effort was unsuccessful over a familiar deadlock to today: cutting entitlements versus raising taxes on the wealthy.

So he is basically saying put people like me and Sinema in charge and we will work in a bipartisan way to cut social safety nets that both parties can agree with. In other words automatically give into Republicans holding the debt ceiling hostage. How about no negotiations.

Honestly how do you negotiate with terrorists. The Republicans are putting the faith and credit of the United States in jeopardy. Because they don't want to pay for the bills they passed. Trump added 9 trillion dollars in 4 years. The corruption of the federal government continues.
Few contacts from there and other touristy places we have from our trip there indicated that they struggled during the pandemic.

At the time of his attempt Castillo had already faced 2 impeachment attempts and the 3rd led by the powerful Congress specifically the allies of Keiko Fujimori were gearing up for 1 more but lacked the support. Probably when Castillo realized he will never be able to accomplish anything without removing a Congress who clearly hates him.

It's complicated, it's a fight between the upper class Lima born Peruvians who are sick of the constant political instability and the poor indigenous people of Peru's south who have been disenfranchised for years, finally have a champion who was one of them in Castillo only for him to be held down by the majority conservative Congress to the point he had to launch a self coup just to get his policies across.

And he is the duly elected president, defeating the Fujinomorista's candidate. However, Congress under Peruvian Constitution has immense power, even more so that the president, and very little check and balance against them. It's impossible to play nice with Congress who not only hates you but actively tries to remove you 3 times.

Yeah, but it's still an elected congress, right? What he "had" to do is recognize he does not have the support he needs to the things he wants and try to make the best of the situation. Not break the system to remove opposition.

Hence the protests. People are tired of the same conservatives running congress and perpetuating the eternal cycle of corruption, and want drastic change. Hell they're asking for a constituent assembly to rewrite their Constitution that's how desperate they've become. The current government has labeled the protesters terrorists, ensuring the police has carte blanche to open fire. This will only get worse before it gets better.

A friend of mine he postponed his wedding in Peru because of the pandemic. This year was the good year, according to the plan, but is now uncertain if it’s even worth trying to have his foreign friends and family fly in because of this developing situation.

This is coming from a person who lives in a country that does not even have a directly elected president, but: having a congress/parliament that is more powerful than a president is not particularly strange or rare. It just means presidential elections are less important than some people apparently believed.
I own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.
Right. Hellofresh at least here in Germany uses basically off the shelf packages of coconut milk that is a name brand.. so basically anyone that distributes that brand is using the same.

Youre correct, and it still is a complete unmitigated shitshow. Important notes are that 1.) Florida began developing as a state well after most other states in the union did (1960’s was when it really began), and most of that development has been tourist-centric. In the lingo of international development, economists and political scientists would be asking why we never bothered to diversify our economy whatsoever.
In that vein, I would recommend looking into the few key economic interests and industries that decide all facets of our political system here. Florida as an electorate has not been republican until this year, and a lot of that is connected to our feckless and collapsing Democratic Party. On top of that, Floridians simply cannot compete for political influence against the likes of Publix, Big Sugar, the cattle industry north of Lake O and now our dictator governor who was propped up by trump in his first campaign in 2018. I’ve lived here my whole life and in several regions; I can tell you a majority of Floridians do not hold the same views as our elected leaders, and most do not support them outside of recent arrivals. But with the way the political system operates here, we have very little agency.

I think this will be very hard to accomplish politically because they will dump millions of dollars on campaign contributions and unlimited contributions to super-pacs. That is why almost every federal politician has a super-pac that has a close political ally or a trusted family member at the helm.

They have very deep pockets and meaningful legislation will kneecap their business model. If anything passes, it will be so watered down that it does practically nothing.

We should also add the cotton gin increased the demand for slavery, because it removed the time consuming bottleneck of combing cotton, and made the production challenge gathering as much cotton from the field as fast as possible.

No it means that the means of production are held communally and democratically and not by the state hence "communism". How stupid are you that even the basic definition from Google escapes you?

Held by the community in a democratic manner also by the point where communism became the norm the state would cease to exist. Lastly people who couldn't even be bothered to Google a definition and decided to be confidently stupid don't get to comment on "political reality".
No way. I'm sure we'll unify and defeat this together by masking up, taking precautions, and getting an updated flu vaccine. No one will get weird about it, everyone will support one another through the crisis, and do their part.
Don't worry, bro We're at the stage where everything is going to be just fine with just a little simple human cooperation.

True. In comparison, another avian influenza, the 1918 Pandemic f/k/a the Spanish Flu, had a mortality rate of 10% and infected 1/3 of the global population.

It needed to be treated like a hurricane. Batten down all hatches. Then again, there's always enough people who think that the hurricane is time for a party and to sing in the rain.

Plug those numbers in today, and that would be 266 million people gone, equivalent to the entire population of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Ireland.

In October, a large outbreak occurred on a mink fur farm in Spain. Researchers who described the outbreak in a paper published last month believe that wild birds initially transmitted H5N1 to the mink farm, but once there, it spread from mink to mink.

Ironically, if people had consistently masked, isolated, and followed other precautions soon, the SARS-CoV-2 could have been contained as SARS-CoV-1 was in 2003.

“This outbreak signals the very real potential for the emergence of mammal-to-mammal transmission,” Michelle Wille, a wild bird virus researcher at the University of Sydney, told the CBC.

“This is incredibly concerning,” Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, told Science Magazine. “This is a clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start.”.

None of the workers, who wore protective gear, at the farm seem to have gotten infected. But some scientists worry that minks could be a kind of stepping stone for the virus to make a jump to humans.

The very little dissent or criticism from the right-wing there is of Trump hosting a literal white supremacist Holocaust denier is also very, very telling. Especially since he was brought by Kanye, who very recently made some extremely antisemitic comments. His following is closer to a cult than a political party.

Agreed. It's very telling because it directly contradicts this narrative that the mainstream GOP has moved on from Trump. If that was actually true, then hosting a neo-Nazi for dinner would be a great chance for them all to uniformly denounce him. The fact that they're all remaining quiet shows that he's unquestionably still the Republican party's standard bearer and the leading nominee for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.

I have lived around right wing Evangelical christians my entire life and I can guarantee you that they ARE NOT going to support a man who is married to a man regardless of what he claims. To them homosexuality directly draws Gods wrath. Milo is a troll and that's about it, I don't take anything he says seriously. He like Trump and Kanye just take controversial positions and say stupid shit for attention and infamy. They don't care why people are talking about them as long as they are talking about them, it's just a narcissistic brain disease.

I think in a lot of ways the Civil War never really ended. Less than a week after the surrender was signed at Appomattox, Lincoln was assassinated and reconstruction was ended shortly thereafter. We're still fighting the same racist assholes today, whether they're confederates, Nazis or just the current mainstream GOP, this fight against white supremacy never really stopped.

There were plenty of elected Republicans who supported the actual Nazis back in the 1930s and 1940s, even distributing Nazi propaganda materials to voters on Hitler's behalf.
On election denial: “oh, Stacy Abrams did it, too.” Yes, she complained of election rigging and refused to concede. But how many people are there running for election right now with an explicit platform of supporting Abrams’ claims? Zero. By comparison, how many repubs are there running right now who willingly admit the election was free of major, result-changing issues? Not conceding, complaining of election rigging unless they win, vowing to change election laws in the favor, etc. are all part of their platform.

Gerrymandering is an issue, and while maybe did not completely cost the Democrats the election, it does deny fair representation.
Gerrymandering is an issue, and while maybe did not completely cost the Democrats the election, it does deny fair representation.
A solution that should be considered is increasing the number of representatives in the house. The over a century old 435-member cap further exacerbates the need for gerrymandering, and lessens the voters power in congress. If you are going to insist on originalism in the courts, then give us more representation in line with the Founders original concepts too.

I don’t disagree but if this was found by the White House then it almost assuredly came from them intentionally making the search. You aren’t wrong that it would have been better had they publicly sooner said “we are searching to make sure we don’t have any either”.

Carelessness due to arrogance; and lack of oversight and real consequences. Same reason after the email “scandal” it continues to come out that every other official is sending sensitive information from hotmail accounts.

Impeach Biden for having the documents when he was supposed to, and impeach him for lying say he didnt know he had them. Impeach a 3rd time for good measure.

Republicans will have fun with this, then it will be forgotten in three months. It might come up if anyone tries to prosecute Trump for his dramatically more egregious and intentional mishandling of classified information, but my guess is that was never in the cards anyway.

It’s also about generating profit from the most salaciously click-worthy headline you can get away with. Who’s going to read an article titled “accurate count of documents provided?”.

Trump lied about having the documents, refused to cooperate, conspired to move the documents to a new location, and eventually had his home raided because there were no other options.

Biden found some files and notified the correct agency and returned them, likely out of carelessness but who fucking knows.

Both bad, but one is objectively much worse than the other. Unfortunately most people will see the situations the way you do, as essentially the same. It’s an unforced error compounded by a lack of interest in details.

I don’t know how damaging the documents are or were. That’s… why they’re classified? I have no reason to believe they are irrelevant nor did I suggest that.

All I know is what’s publicly available information right now. Yes, it’s possible something is being covered up here. But why apply that to Biden and not Trump? Maybe Trump was trying not to return the documents because they contain information about all the porn star’s abortions he’s paid for. Anything’s possible right? But running wild with conspiracy theories doesn’t actually help with assessing anything, because it’s all conjecture and ultimately pointless.
