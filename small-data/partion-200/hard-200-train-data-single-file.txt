I'm not gonna watch the video. I gotta keep my sanity. With that being said, what could we call for that they haven't done? The cops have been fired and charged with murder. That happened before the video came out, before the news of anything came out. The police department has been responsible about this.
Maybe police agencies should be not federalized but under one agency. No more sherriffs no more local police. Just state police. 50 states, 50 police agencies. Keep it simple.

Actual combat soldiers have much more discipline and a very narrow set of ROE. We are not allowed to go around and detain civilians and beat them up if the answers they gave us weren’t satisfactory. You would WANT a former combat soldier to be a police officer, but there’s always one or two assholes.

Police departments attract brutes, do nothing to screen them out, train them to be brutal, then protect them when they are brutal. Conservatives then overpay and over provision them, letting them LARP around with military gear. It’s America’s biggest gang.
That's false, there are several factions involved in the Yemen Civil War. There's the Iranian-backed Houthis, the Saudi-backed government of al-Alimi, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, more independent groups such as the Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance then of course Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS-"Yemen Province", the latter two fight against all the rest and they also fight each other.
Houthi Rebels representing Houthis that have been historically been oppressed and are currently being genocided, responsible for overthrowing an unelected government propped up by the Saudis in the Arab Spring.

The Saudi bombing campaign has been atrocious, but there's still legitimate reasons to support the UN recognized Yemeni government over the Houthi movement.

It's horrible what's happening in Yemen, but don't start pretending those murderous bastards are some sort of freedom loving local heroes.

Houthis arent fighting for freedom, they're an extremist terrorist group backed by Russia, Iran and North Korea.
In the past 2 months, Fidesz has built a narrative about the EU sanctions against Russia being the cause of the Hungarian economy tanking and the value of the Hungarian Forint taking a nosedive.
This narrative paints Orbán and his party as "freedom fighters" trying to keep a deranged Brussels in check, shifting all blame solely on the EU.

A (it's in Hungarian, not sure if there is an English version) revealed that a third of all voters (and half of Orbán's voters) were convinced that Orbán voted against the sanctions.

This is possible due to a small detail about the sanctions being kept obscure in the media: Any one head of a member state not signing a sanction is enough to stop it from coming into effect. In other words, Orbán signed everything that he claims is hurting his country.

All of Orbán's ideological friends abroad are in trouble. Trump is under legal investigation, Bolosanaro is out, Russia is desperately grappling to keep a losing war going longer in the desperate fantasy that Western unity will fall apart with the cold and so on.
3) sign it, then claim Ukraine broke it thus giving them an excuse to join the Russian effort further.
Finally, signing such a pact would allow Belarus to allow Russia to launch attacks from Belarus, without allowing Ukraine to strike back.

But if Belarus invades Ukraine, and they are the aggressors, suddenly everything in Belarus is a legitimate target. All the Russian troops that are stationed there, all the Belarussian troops, all of the government buildings, internal police, etc. All of it becomes a legitimate target of war.

Lukashenko is under a lot of pressure by Putin to join the war, but he has to balance this against the risk of his own regime becoming legitimate targets. It's not inconceivable that Ukraine could cooperate with Belarusian resistance forces to knock out enough military and governmental infrastructure with air and artillery strikes to make the Lukashenko regime vulnerable. They could also work with their Western allies to arm Belarusian resistance forces. Suddenly the Belarusian army and police will have to deal with a flood of weapons including small arms and more dangerous things like Javelins and NLAWs. The West absolutely could provide these weapons to Belarusian resistance forces now, but again, unless Belarus attacks first, it would amount to an "unprovoked aggression" against Belarus. Again, if Ukraine is seen as striking first, it would severely degrade the diplomatic standing they currently enjoy.

It would also strongly be in Ukraine's interests to see Lukashenko removed from power. A free Belarus aligned with the West would be an enormous boon to Ukraine. It would mean that Ukraine's northern front would be completely safe from invasion, meaning they can devote more troops to other fronts. A free Belarus would also be a great ally for Ukraine. Long-term, it would mean a much more defensible border against future Russian aggression. With Belarus firmly in the Russian orbit, Ukraine is effectively surrounded on three sides. With Belarus and Crimea recaptured, Ukraine would only have to worry about invasion from one side.

Luka would sign it, forced by Putin, only to get more Russian troops into Belarus, and closer to Kyiv. Hoping for Ukraine to let their guard down on the north so Putin could try and take Kyiv again like last year.
Then you have somebody like Ken Paxton who hires a team of lawyers to come in and immediately lay the groundwork for saying that their client is an attorney and a highly respected public official and the normal Bond conditions don't make any sense at all, why should he have to pee in a cup in front of a probation officer when he's just charged with fraud? And staying inside the county couldn't possibly work because he has to travel all the time for his job duties.
The wealthy don't get better outcomes because they get special treatment or because they bribe judges or whatever. They start from a position of privledge and have the ability to afford lawyers who can advocate for them, whereas people who don't have that tend to be worked through the system.

That bias is both due to how the system is structured (e.g., being able to afford bail or high-powered lawyers) as well as implicit (e.g., subconscious preferential treatment towards the wealthy at all levels of the justice system).

Is that due to a bias towards the wealthy, or the fact the wealthy have more resources than the poor to oppose those steps at every turn and cultivate their appearance to the court room? I would guess the latter, more often than not.
For the sake of when the topic is conservation, captive tigers aren't considered "real" tigers in the field, they're irrelevant. The population number always relates to wild tigers, who breed, hunt, live and survive in the wild.
A growing wild tiger population is indicative of a healthy forest ecosystem. So this news is a big win for all wild animals in general.

India's conservation efforts have been great since 1973, with an average tiger population growth rate of 6% per annum. Give credit where it's due.

Meh, please be critical of us where we merit it. As long as it's objective criticism, and not just because India's priorities aren't the same as whatever country you're from (whether that be in the west, China, Russia or otherwise), criticism is useful.

Ah, I don't. Would be happy if we continue to have strong and stable relationships with most countries (ideally with a long-term solution to our issues with Pakistan, which is the only country with which i hope we have a significant shift in our foreign policy within my lifetime), without going into any bloc. India shouldn't be within the west's camp in the way that Asian countries like Japan or Korea are.

Which isn't unmerited - it's similar to how some people have been critical about the rise of nationalism in the US, Brazil, Poland, Turkey and Hungary (amongst others).
Ukraine back in 2014 was not the same it is now. Nobody would have given them anywhere close to the weapons they were given now.
The M1 has an older gun that the modern Leopards. The M1 is still using the licensed gun which is the 120mm L44. The modern Leopard 2 starting with the A6 variant use the 120mm L55.

Yeah, it's literally a Leopard 2A4 hull, just with a new turret housing a 130mm main gun instead of the usual 120mm one.

Again, instead of comparing the M1 to the T-72, compare it to the Leopard 2, which has the same gun. Exact same gun. In fact the gun was developed for the Leopard 2, and later adapted to the M1.

The Leopard 2 has the same gun. They invented that gun. If the Leopard 2 is less hampered by logistics and can also kill T-72s, and it was designed with them in mind, perhaps its a better tank.

Bigger question is not T-72 vs M1, but what is so greater about the Abrams that its worth the logistics burden including fuel and not being able to cross real bridges in the most likely actual battlefields over the Leopard 2?

The next question goes: How much better is an M1 Abrams vs a Leopard 2 that justifies that added logistics burden that will exist for any army that fields any tanks or any vehicles.

Military vehicles are supposed to be designed with logistics in mind, a more expensive vehicle to maintain, takes away from other parts of the military.

This is an issue of great concern and much importance to me. I have a hard time understanding the vituperative and hateful things I read on political forums. The author writes in the article: “The dream with One Small Step is that we convince the country it’s our patriotic duty to see the humanity in people with whom we disagree, which is a complete moon shot.”.

Let's be honest, the main reason Russia leaves them is because it puts a burden on Ukraine and the West. Due to the nobility and empathy, I don't think we would just let anyone die if they could be treated.
If Russia wasn't using these soldiers trying to get Ukraine to spend money/time/energy on POWs, I shudder to think of what they might otherwise be used for.

Ukrainian soldiers aren't incapable of being cruel fucks in war, on the less the Russians armies systemic maltreatment of their own soldiers probably favours such an outcome in soldier's. The reason why you are fighting is defently also a big part of it. (Why i think that wounded russian soldiers aren't killed or worse, instead treated) well hopefully.

Russian army probably abandoning their wounded because they know the Ukrainians will give them medical attention. This is about adding strain to already busy medics and doctors. Goes hand in hand with destroying civilization infrastructure.
I'm not against this but this really needs massive investment from a top down approach or it simply become like plastic "recycling" where it's a feel god narrative that simply doesn't happen the way it's sold to public. Preferably government investments for renewables that is owned and retained by the state.
Tax credits are fine but a rebate is better. As for roof solar it's good but the problem of renters ending up paying higher costs in the long run is real problem while the subsidize the landlords investment because you know the won't be passing any money back the renter when electricity prices rise due to the infrastructure overhaul.

I suppose my problem is not that people who can afford the outlay getting money back but that whole sections of society who can't will be hit hardest.

If the government is really serious about this, there shouldn't be "financial incentives" but a complete cost subsidy. Make the whole process just a phone number the homeowner calls to schedule installation, and never sees a bill. Until then the White House will get few takers, especially since inflation is hurting everyone each trip to a store, and wages aren't keeping up with inflation.
So if sounds like if they're nearby they may just have to bring their laptop over once a month or soemthing lol. I guess the issue is you don't know when that's gonna be and will be annoying. Prob the only thing th ex and I could actually agree on. No reason to sub twice for kids streaming.. just annoying for the one parent that wants to use it occasionally as well. Been kinda looking for an excuse to cancel Netflix so we will see how it plays out.
"For viewers who frequently travel or own a second home, Netflix says the account holder will have to sign in on their Netflix mobile app at least once a month while connected to the Wi-Fi at their primary location.".

Yep. I can see why the suits want this feature, but there's no way to implement it that doesn't inconvenience families with kids in college - one of the main legitimate use cases - or which doesn't introduce hilarious loopholes, like how you should theoretically be able to share an account with other people in your dorm.

You mean like college students? They're probably one of the main demographics of legitimate sharing, but Netflix only lets that happen if they can go home at least once a month.

But even if you could come up with a reasonable technological definition of a household, I still feel like watching on multiple screens is less likely than you'd think. To me, at least, that always felt like a feature to allow for college students and similar, so you don't have to coordinate watching times at multiple locations. (Think "Get off the phone, I need to use the internet") There are still some use cases for multiple screens, like if someone wants to watch on their commute, but they're a lot less common.

Honestly, though. If they just made it something like one location per screen, I feel like there'd be a lot less of a pushback. Because currently, they're making weird assumptions like 4 people all watching it at the same time in the same house.
They won't touch it hate him or not because it pisses off just enough people to ensure they might lose in the future. The elections are too close anymore. Plus regardless of whether they hate Trump or not this sort of thing is unpopular with Conservative voters anyways.
There's already dissention in the GOP ranks between supporting DeSantis or Trump. The mainstay GOP wants DeSantis as the nomination, but they don't want backlash from Trump's core group of diehard supporters.

Actually my favorite outcome would be Desantis gets the GOP nomination, then Trump runs as an Independent and splits the right’s voter pool, thus causing them to lose as well.

If Trump is barred from running by Democrats, it literally gives the GOP exactly what they want. They have a reason for running DeSantis over Trump, and can actually take advantage of Trump's core supporters while blaming Democrats for overreach. This will literally pull all the GOP groups together behind DeSantis, the GOP's favored candidate, while Dems will have to scramble to get a candidate capable of defeating him.

2024 is already going to be an uphill battle, but there's a chance with Trump/DeSantis fracturing the GOP voting bloc. Something like this is literally giving them exactly the win they want, and it is so mind-numbingly fucking stupid to do.
I think your complete dismissal of public opinion is understandable, but it does in fact move the needle over time. Every idiot online who claims that Elon was just setting things straight can have this thrown in their face, and will lose credibility to those new to the conversation.

It’s all part of the same transit system including the subway, and people jump the fare gates and sneak onto the buses already. The transit police don’t enforce the fares.
It's part of a larger regional system that gets payments from MD and VA. Presumably the buses in VA and MD will still charge, and the subway system is hella expensive for people riding in from the ends of the lines. (Over $10 round trip daily for me.).

So much this. It's understandable if service slows with the demand drop, but it is simply unacceptable to have 4-8 hour periods where no public transit is available.

it has the same problems of getting slowed down by traffic but it's even slower because of the stops, so it's not an appealing option. for example imagine that street with a single traffic lane, rail line down the middle and hard protected bike lanes on either side. When traffic gets worse they can add more rail car traffic or people can choose to ride their bike. Traffic still slows down but the flow of people overall is much more resilient.

Rail stops also encourage development around the stops. It's an infill strategy. choosing where a rail like goes in is in effect choosing where development happens, so you can drive density to specific neighbors. Auto infrastructure just spreads people out further, and creates dead unpleasant parts of the city where you have big feeder streets.

that's actually kind of the point though, you lived next to a light rail so there was stuff nearby. you can also displace traffic with it. people never willingly do that because people are the worst but it's a lot easier for city planners to make the case of not investing in auto infrastructure when there's a real second option. It actually makes sense to put them in before it's entirely necessary or useful because getting the right of ways worked out is the hardest part. you can add capacity on a light rail way easier and cheaper than you can on a surface road, a bus route is flexible but it has more of a real limit in terms of bus drivers and passengers and traffic impacts.

When this was proposed during the election last year, one of the local think tanks commissioned a study that found eliminating bus fares would do little to improve ridership, but that increasing the frequency of buses would. They thus advocated against eliminating fares and instead investing that extra money into more frequent service (this bill somewhat increased funding, but not enough to make the recommended changes). Alas.
Thanks for summarizing this so well. The question is what should be done about it? This works, it excites their rabid base, it distracts the opposition who points at the clown in a strange entrancing spectacula,, all the while billionaires and corporations destroy the country.
But it more than just her district, the whole society is being manipulated by forces that foisted this dirt bag into power. Very few people win elections without backing, she is meant to a distraction.

Yes. Also, putting "Independent" in scare quotes is absurd. Why did the Dems win in '18 and '20, and hold off the Red Wave in '22? Because Independents broke blue.
Excuse me, but is your country already running on renewables-only? If not, please be quiet. Starting a war was Putin‘s/Russia‘s decision, not Europe’s.
Blaming Europe for russia attacking people shows a remarkable ability on your part to twist anything to suit your viewpoint.

The eu uses trade as a means to avoid war, it has been doing that successfully in Western Europe and slowly bringing in the countries on the east side that are willing. It was naive in hindsight to think russia would put peace and prosperity for it's people ahead of warmongering but that doesn't mean Europe is to blame.

The hope was that making Russia dependent on Europe for money they desperately need, in exchange for oil Europe needs, they wouldn't be stupid enough to attack Europe's new friend Ukraine.

It turned out we were wrong, but people are vindictive, if you think you can strongarm us, we'd rather cripple ourselves and pay more for oil from elsewhere than keep cooperating with you Russia. So Russia gets way less of the recource money, and Europe spends more on the gain of their recources.

If I attack, I need to attack 2 countries, and supply chains break down and I can't keep producing product A for who knows how long? It's a risk. If I try to attack and gain control over 1 country, the other will stop sending their recources, so we now have control over one recource but lack the other completely.
And while you need one (or usually: more than one) soldier to get the injured out of the battlefield, which might take minutes or maybe hours, the wounded soldier afterwards needs treatment by professional medics, still needs to be fed, to be housed, etc., Despite being of no use to the military any more.
Ekaterina Shulman recently quoted something like 17k cases of the Russian government paying widows the promised money for their husbands killed in the conflict, and that's naturally only the cases which were so obvious even the government couldn't deny payment, plus this number most likely doesn't include the losses from dnr, lnr, pmc Wagner etc.

And seeing how very bad Russian medical support is, far worse ratios than 1:4 or 1:3 dead:wounded can be expected.

Why do you bring up the 1.1m total military number? This includes strategic missile forces, border patrol, navy, etc - lots of people who don't matter in this war.

Just fucking idiots lol. Like, it's all just stupid frat clowns bro jokes. Yet they think they're smart and funny. That's the really astonishing part about all of this.
Not really. You just keep using the main line until it lets you wait 4 hours to talk to somebody. Thats what you paid them for. They were willing to wait on the phone.
By "they" you must mean republicans. Until very recently (and really still) the IRS has been woefully under funded. Trump exacerbated that extremely. But when rebulicans make it nearly impossible for the IRS to do their job, everyone wants to blame the stressed, overworked employees who are just trying to keep up.

We can't have an quick and easy way to pay taxes because approximately half the government wants it to be annoying and inefficient to pay taxes.

California tried to change their income tax system once. If all you've got in regular income from your job, then the tax people already know how much you make and how much you owe. So they put together a pilot program where they just mailed you a postcard that said "Here's how much you made and how much you owe. If it's all correct, just send this postcard back, and if something is wrong file your taxes normally.".

Duh. Stupid Republicans have been voting for people who significantly lower taxes (remember the GOP Tax Scam disguised as tax ‘reform’) for the wealthy and corporations for four decades.

Don’t pretend useful idiots in the left haven’t abetted this also - always screaming in support of “income tax” increases - when the really rich don’t have ordinary W2 income. The very rich are quite happy to see the working class attack the professional class (their imagined rich) while their own wealth and income streams remain largely untouched.

Just see the rabid responses on Reddit to a person actually earning 300k (eg a doctor or Silicon Valley engineer). Those people are not the problem - but you wouldn’t think that.
Republicans leaders might be getting blackmailed by someone who is getting blackmailed by Putin. Republicans are just getting used for their gullibility and ignorance to right and wrong.

They also would also vote for Democrats do instead of idiots who blow the entire budget on PR stunts. Like the wall, child care from splitting children from their parents, and unnecessary detainments of people waiting for an immigration hearing.

Deportations decreased significantly during the Trump presidency while illegal immigration increased significantly. He was just so incompetent and ineffectual he made illegal immigration significantly worse.

I don’t think holding their feet to the fire will work - they don’t care. (It’s also about controlling sexuality, in spite of abortion being health care).
So antivaxxers leapt onto the argument of "I can't take this shot because it violates my religious beliefs against abortions.".

Yes. I was making the point that this behavior is not going to go away because there is a system of those in service who continue to push this narrative for their own benefit. I have seen the behavior of some service members out in public and it clearly shows they are happy for the worship. They can be confrontational when they don't get it.

As a former service member, you are asking for a miracle. The hero idea is endemic within the service. It is akin to the police force. You're asking for individuals to give up their special treatment card and humbly accept that while the job is unique, it does not make someone special. It is still just a job and trust me when I say, not everyone who puts on the uniform is worth even the paycheck they receive. Sadly, those are usually the ones that demand the praise.
Todd is a full throated republican apologist. just because his clock was right in this instance with jim Jordan, I could go on and on about all the obvious questions and pushback he didn't give to good old Gymbo in this pathetic interview.
If you think Todd is a fair and balanced you haven't seen much of Chuck Todd (or you are living in a republican paranoid fantasy).

Nah he's probably a fed up conservative who's capable of some critical thought and can't excuse or bear the circus anymore. Some of these ex-R anchors are late-comers to the party, but welcomed, at least.

This is what Trump seems to be counting on.. again... for his 2024 run. After the last loss and everything that's transpired since then, you'd have to be an idiot to think you have a fair shot with a normal campaign, or a 2nd-chance coup leader who knows something's coming or being set up.
I'm an old US MLRS/HIMARS soldier/officer. If the report is correct that 6 rockets were fired and 4 hit, 200-400 KIA/WIA would be very possible in a building. From the initial information, it sounds like the place was a staging area or barracks. If it was also true ammo was stored nearby well then lord knows how many could have been KIA/WIA.
This sounds like a precision strike that just hit a perfect target. Frankly the only defense against MLRS is.

Russians also should have learned not to quarter 600 men within artillery range of the line of contact in a civilian building that's extremely vulnerable to artillery fire... But here we are. I wouldn't give the Russians any benefit of the doubt at this point.
Exactly, idk how we're going to get the systemic changes we need to see now done with such gerrymandered voting and paying off our congressional leaders/insider trading.
Except that the "let's end moneyed politics" party has more or less the same list of donors, and makes sure to introduce it as a constitutional amendment which has a ridiculously high bar to pass so they can make absolutely sure their proposal won't actually pass.

republicans could decide they don't support buying politicians any time they want, it's not like they're legally obligated to support corruption or anything. they're choosing to be corrupt and they could choose not to be if they felt like it.

Not only that, it requires a Constitutional amendment, which requires a 2/3rds majority in the House and in the Senate. It's more likely you see Kevin McCarthy and Eric Swalwell holding hands in public than this passing.
A protest is a dialogue of the people, by the people, and for the people. For example, if you're upset at where things are headed- step outside alongside your friends, neighbors, and compatriots, bang on some pans, yell out some slogans, get some anger out, and maybe organize some next steps.
Protests can be effective as a tool of change. There are other tools in the toolbox, mind you, and the state is aware of that. Why else do you think they (the state) would attempt to quell protests using violence if there were no point to them?

The thing, the protesters having weapons probably wouldn't make this that much better since the government would just have better weapons. And those weapons do nothing without some sort of legal foundation for the protesters to grab onto.

High explosives don't look like this. Watch footage of a controlled demolition, or go over to r/CombatFootage and look at munitions exploding. There's very little flame/fire involved. Hollywood doesn't use those explosives because they're not visually impressive enough.
Have to factor in greatly increased shipping costs. Pipeline to EU is very cheap compared to shipping to India. Add to that the lack of available ships thanks to the sanctions that just kicked in, and lawl. At fifty two dollars they are losing money.

North of Svatove there's a Russian border town called Valuyki, with a fairly major rail depot. That directly connects to the occupied Ukrainian town of Troitsky, which in turn has a road running due south to Svatove. And the rail line continues from Troitsky down to the eastern Luhansk area. Farther east of that there's mostly nothing but rural communities, the next Russian rail line doesn't enter Ukraine until way farther east and south.

But the rail line through Starobilsk doesnt go directly towards Donetsk, but ends somewhere near the coast in Luhansk as far as I know.

Svatove covers one of the few rail lines going from the Moscow direction directly towards Luhansk/Donetsk. The next best line goes throug Starobilsk further to the east, which would in itself be a detour and would prolong the transit times of goods.

Russia also has another railroad to the east of Svatove at Starobilsk, which is currently the only railway running north --> south from Russia into Ukraine.

Basically enables Ukraine to maneuver around Lsychansk and Sverodonetsk and cuts Russian supplies by rail and road. Svatove has lots of communication routes to the rest of luhansk oblast.

And on the flip side, Ukraine has a large rail connection at Kupyans'k. Which has both a rail and a highway connection southeast to near Svatove, and from there south to Kreminna and Lysychansk. Once they control Svatove, they have a clear shot to Lysychansk. Which is the major regional objective.
The irony is great. I am curious why the dems haven't reached out to the more reasonable republicans to nominate one of them. The chance to stop the MAGA and crazy legislative slate is pretty much there for the taking.
EDIT\ there are far too many comments to respond to so I will post my one thought about it here. They don't need to nominate an active house member. They can nominate Liz Cheney, they can nominate Bill Gates, they could nominate anyone that they can get 6 republicans to agree on. There may be a few dems that would never nominate a republican but I think there is someone out there that the democrats can partner with 6+ GOP members on to get put in. It would show good faith from dems to vote with some GOP members and it would totally stop the waste of a legislative session by ending the upcoming wasteful "investigations" into the FBI, DOJ, Hunter Biden, Jan 6th committee and any other crazy stupid thing the modern GOP want to go after.

The GOP is dead, when you elect, "loons and whack jobs" into position of authority, they poison minds with idiotic rhetoric, all they want to do is revenge, not governance, this is cesspool politics millions vote for, McCarthy cant let these people win, if he does, he is a fool.

If McCarthy was smart, he'd tell those hardline Republicans that he's got 6 moderate Republicans who'll turncoat and vote for the Democrat and they'll get NONE of their agenda through for the next 2 years.

As a moderate Republican in Congress, or rather, a less crazy one, would you really want to vote for McCarthy after all the concessions? He’s going to be QAnon property, anyone can make him fold.
There's no reason to think we're close to that point, but moving in that direction is a bad thing. This thread reeks of, '"What are you going to, stab me?" - man who was stabbed' vibes.

The West refuses to participate in Ukraine’s target list inside Russia or Ukraine. The West believes that even discouraging Ukraine from attacking inside Russia would constitute our being part of the war because, by participating in selecting targets, we would be involved in waging it. We want no part of this war beyond giving Ukraine arms, training, equipment, and humanitarian aid. No one is willing to risk cross that line.
I personally see no way to fairly determine who gets and who pays. There are many blacks and whites in this country whose ancestors had nothing at all to do with slavery or Jim Crow. I would support something along the lines of the GI Bill of Rights to pay for education, home loans, business loans to all underprivileged blacks, which could cost more but that’s ok with me. I strongly support that because it helps blacks and helps the country. Reparation is a con job that does nothing for the country except engender massive resentment by those unfairly forced to pay.
Why should non-blacks whose ancestors suffered war, death, injuries and maiming from fighting for the Union be forced to pay?

Slave ownership is not the only cause of their lack of equity building, our nation's society caused that, and still has in recent years, i.e. not even allowed to obtain a mortgage, insurance on mortgages, ect.

Yeah. In terms of being the nominee, I think this largely depends on how Trump’s base reacts to someone who isn’t Trump winning (I don’t see Trump handing off the torch, and a win by DeSantis without Trump’s acknowledgement could be a pyrrhic victory) and also how much of the suburban base DeSantis could lose if he has to out-ugly Trump in order to clench the primary.

I’m not sure DeSantis would be worse than Trump. More focused (in implementing his terrible policies), yes. More acceptable to moderates (at least those who don’t know his policies would be more draconian than Trump’s), yes. The biggest thing that made Trump effective, though, was the cult of personality he generated, and the fact that people gave him a pass for being openly terrible, because “that’s just how he is”. I don’t see DeSantis attaining the same cult status easily, and his appeal to moderates is a double edged sword, in that, he couldn’t get away with many of the scandals that Trump could. This goes doubly with conservatives possibly (we’ll see) souring on the strategy of being as openly socially far right after Trump.

Yeah, it is an interesting mix, and following the money is always a good way to go. I would say that in 2016, interestingly, Republican money didn’t sway people away from Trump. I don’t think this cements him as an actual anti establishment politician, as big money largely got what they wanted after his administration got into office, but he definitely wasn’t favored by the establishment at first. In a sense, it was a Frankenstein’s monster situation, in that he catered to the bogey man scenarios that the right wing media conjured up better than any establishment politician was able to. Money certainly seems to be behind DeSantis, but it is unclear to me if they can craft a narrative that is compelling to both Trump’s hardcore base, and the disaffected suburban conservatives who voted for Trump once, but who now have moved to embrace more centrist candidates. If DeSantis is simply Trump policy-wise, but minus the charisma, this would be the worst outcome for him.

Either they end up being dairy cows themselves or are perhaps selected for the meat industry or are selected to be bulls for breeding future dairy cows.

Ok. Locally-sourced dairy, eggs, and fish; 90% plant based diet; policies to reduce waste; and the inevitable waste they do have is fed to hogs that are raised for a once-a-semester hog roast.

Nothing in the article discussed the morality of animal-based products in and of themselves, only their ecological effect. Whether or not you think it's fundamentally immoral for omnivores to eat animals has no bearing on the policies at hand.

Less than 1% voter turnout is certainly not a good situation, but if it was voluntary on the part of that 99%, it does become a "lie in your own bed" kind of situation. Most "student" decisions like this will always be made by the small minority of students who care enough to attend meetings.
The problem is that, by the numbers, Texas is significantly less Republican than it projects. The split is somewhere between 60-40 or 55-45 % red versus blue, which is within striking distance of flipping.
However Republicans consistently hold majorities-even supermajorities (2/3) of the seats. The reason is that Texas has some of the worst Gerrymandering in the country and is barely a democracy at this point.

The Texas Democratic Party has nobody to blame but themselves for losing elections. And it's not even that Republicans are all that popular. NOBODY in Texas actually likes Abbott, Cruz or Paxton. Not many people actually liked Perry either. It's that the Texas Democratic Party is so poorly run, that a lot of Texans don't even know who the Democratic candidate is, let alone want to vote for them. If they can't beat fucking Abbott, Cruz Paxton, or Perry, then they're absolutely incompetent.

That might sound harsh, but when you haven't won a meaningful election in almost 30 years, keep bringing out a candidate who has lost twice already and thinks saying "Hell yes, we're coming for your AR-15s" in TEXAS, that's incompetence. When you lose by double digits to a governor who caused Texans to freeze to death and responded to an elementary school shooting with "It could have been worse", AS WELL AS an attorney general who's under indictment, despite all of them having sub-50% approval ratings AND more than half of Texans saying the state is headed in the wrong direction, that's the definition of incompetent.
When Congress passed the spending bill, I would say they authorized the debt. The Treasury should just keep holding bond auctions and dare Congress or SCOTUS to stop them.
The coin would sort of preclude having to issue new debt but the US would continue honouring all old bonds.

So many people who have these conservative values about personal debt (which are very good) get worked up about national debt, but they are so different you cannot compare.

Most national debt is held in that nation by retirement funds and investment banks and giant corporations etc.

Isn't the biggest debt holder the American people? So even if China holds a big chunk it's still going to be smaller than all of the debt held by Americans.

That’s why I don’t understand why people get so up in arms about China owning lots of US debt like it makes us dependent on them in some way. It’s the complete opposite. If China gets too uppity and does something like invade Taiwan, we just say “hey, you know that trillions off dollars we owe you? Yeah.. about that.. we’re not going to pay you back”.

For starters, the USSR was on the defensive and they had no choice but to fight cause the alternative would've been surrending the country to the Germans. Here, Russia is attacking which means the "soldiers" could simply stop fighting and go home.
Ever since fall of last year, Putin's message was "we want to stop the war along currently held borders." This stance allows him to:
Ever since fall of last year, Putin's message was "we want to stop the war along currently held borders." This stance allows him to:
Russia is probing the waters with smaller (although still sizeable) offensives such as under Vuhledar. Based on the disastrous results, they're likely to call off their larger offensives, lest they bog down, get wrecked, and allow a massive Ukrainian counteroffensive (either in April or even earlier.) Russia can't afford another strategic defeat like in Kharkiv last year, not because of a lack of manpower, but because it's already on shaky ground morale wise, and continued defeats could spell doom for Putin's ability to continue rallying his nation to fight.

Hence, I don't believe the upcoming Russian winter offensive is truly aiming to capture Kyiv or Kharkiv, or otherwise defeat Ukraine as a whole. It's neither physically not politically realistic. Instead, Putin's goal is to tie up Ukrainian troops and spoil their own counteroffensive, hoping to buy enough time for the West to get tired of supporting Ukraine.

If Putin loses these borders, his strategy will no longer work, since he will no longer be able to pretend that the ball is not in his court. He would have to either accept defeat (something that will likely cost him his power, or worse), or change his message to once again go from a faux-defensive war to an openly offensive one, with an unclear end and many future casualties. After a year of disasters and no evidence of things improving in the short or even medium term, Putin cannot be sure Russians are eager to once again go on the offensive, one which they now know will be long, bloody, and heavily rely on conscripts that have zero desire to be there (his professional army having been mauled within the first year.).

Can we please wait for polls to close before we start the doom and gloom? I know it's a rough and frankly scary day in general. But remember, old boomers and above don't work so they have plenty of time to vote early today. It happens at every election and they always vote on the red side of things so it will seem skewed to the right at the start.

A quick reminder: We ARE going to have to deal with people claiming the vote was rigged. In every election. In super-blue California House districts. In local judgeships lost because the candidate shot a local's dog.
The Russians do love them some war crimes and atrocities. I am sure it will result in them being hunted down not unlike the Nazis after WWII. We in the rest of the world need to leverage our elected officials not to end sanctions while war criminals walk free in Russia.

P.S. I remember earlier on people were talking about making your comments into a book, which I think is a great idea Though perhaps a website could also work. There's also the question of whether your replies to peoples' comments should be included, and how to refer to those people replying to you, whether it'd require permission from them or something. I remember some of your replies were very helpful in expanding on the details of your situation. Then there’s the question of whether or not to include the karma of the comments too… anyway, those are some interesting technical details that will have to be considered at a later date – but hopefully that date comes soon.

Hi /u/SaberFlux, I just want to say that I really appreciate your updates that you've been doing over this past year. I’ve just been observing, but your updates have really helped me to understand just a little bit about what you and many of the Ukrainian people have been going through in this awful war. Your updates have really helped connect us to the human side, the human aspect of what life is like during this war, and helped me understand on a deeper level what it is like, and further justified why Ukraine needs as much support as we can give it. I hate war, but that is precisely why Ukraine must be victorious, and must be supported so it can achieve it.

Seriously hoping for Ukraine to win and obliterate Russia this year, for everyone on both sides of the border. The whole world needs it.

Honestly yeah, not sure what I'd do. So far I was lucky to survive but who knows how long that will last. Obviously zero funds or marketable skills to leave anywhere. (Currently a library worker so yeah).
Georgia Republicans sure did like runoffs in all the years they flipped a Democratic win in the general to a Republican win in the runoff. Acting only when Republicans start losing runoff elections after decades of winning them makes the timing conspicuous.
The notion that Raffensperger is opposing runoffs to try to consolidate Republican power is laughable.

. He's also infamous for standing up to Trump when he was calling around, begging for votes. Plus, he's breaking ranks with his entire party to join Democrats in opposing runoffs. So no, I don't think he wants to change it to where they get to pick if it's close to a tie.

Georgia Democrats heavily favor getting rid of runoffs, partly because it's a holdover from post-segregation attempts at curbing the Black vote, and partly because it makes voting harder, which is to say it's voter suppression. Raffensperger is breaking with the rest of his party to join the left here. He's also as a replacement for runoffs. Finally, he's infamous for being . The idea that this guy has anything to do with Republicans trying to cheat their way to victory is laughable lol.

I think it's weird to assume that simply because Republicans are losing the run-offs that is why Raffensperger wants rid of them. The simple fact is that NOBODY likes run-off elections. Raffensperger's office even offers ranked-choice voting as an alternative.

Honestly, I think that everyone in Georgia is just legitimately tired of it. It is incredibly burdensome and unnecessary. I'm no fan of the GOP and particularly Georgia Republicans but Raffensperger appears to be guy with whom I politically disagree but I wouldn't consider an enemy of democracy like many of his Georgia brethren like MTG.
From what sources? This is the issue my friend. A few billionaires able to pave the way or (hundreds of) thousands of citizens wanting a better life. Which sounds like a proper source of funds for electioneering. Yes there are billionaires that donate to Democrats and spend for Democrats; not even close to the amount involved with the Republicans.
What does Sanders have to say about billionaires giving money to Democrats? What does Sanders have to say about Democrats who willingly take money from these billionaires?

Are there are no large donations to Democrats? And why are you still so hung up on the size of individual donations? If I give $100 to Republican PACs while the Democrats raise $1 from each of 1 million people, you would probably still be going on rants about huge donations to the GOP. The size of any individual donation is 100% irrelevant.

Limiting how much a politician can accept from any individual is not the same as telling everyone in the country what they can and can not spend their money on.

This could work similarly with politicians where they could only receive up to a certain amount. I would also limit it to campaign support only and not allow politicians to be bought for bill/law support!
I have a serious question. Trandgender people don’t feel comfortable using the bathroom that corresponds to their biological sex, so advocates say that they should be able to use the bathroom of their choice. If biological women don’t feel comfortable sharing the bathroom why are their concerns not valid? If anything why not make a third bathroom for trans students?
Trans people want to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. If they have not had gender reassignment surgery, then I also understand why woman would not want to have someone with a penis in the bathroom with them. Now I personally think it's silly because no one's looking at genitals in restrooms. But and I mean this is the nicest way possible, but why are the concerns of cis people discounted? Trans people don't want to use the restroom of their birth gender, because that makes them uncomfortable. But if cis people are uncomfortable with someone who still has the opposite genitalia in their bathroom they shouldn't be listened to as well?

This way you could know that you wouldn’t have any trans people sharing your restroom, while also not imposing your fears about the diarrhea thing on other people.

Your solution also puts an open target on trans people who then have to out themselves any time they want to use the restroom which can be dangerous.

I think any state that issues trans bathroom bans should be legally required to have an alternative bathroom trans people can use. Single stalls, teachers restrooms. I think that is a happy medium and both sides can feel comfortable. And before anyone says well that's not right, the bathroom issue is a distractive talking point. My idea addresses it, and makes it stop being one.
Democracy tells about the source of the power the offices wield (demos - the 'mob' or people). It is contrary to monarchy (bloodline) where the confusion comes from, theocracy (god), and dictatorship (power/might/military).
I could accept this, if I did not explicitly brought up an example of this not being the case. A republic can be easily a country where the upper class or some arbitrary group elects the officials. One could argue that the US was originally not a democracy, as only land owning white men were able to vote. But this is a false view of history, trying to apply current day morality to past structures and events. In their time the original US system was a fairly progressive one, that was viewed as democracy by its peers, and was intended to be a federation of democracies in a democracy by its founders (however irrelevant that is).

Now, I know some states are trying to popularize the notion of illiberal democracy, which is fundamentally absurd, imo, same strategy as Republicans stateside like Mike Lee seem to embrace, enjoying the trappings of democracy while trying to pull the ladder up behind them, etc. I think it’s an ugly, power hungry strategy.

At the end of the day, however, you simply can’t make the argument that democracy is not integral to the function of any republic, and if your state structures are granted legitimacy by democratic consent of the governed, if they are built on the foundation of popular democracy, pulling up the ladder so fewer people are represented is nothing less than authoritarian, anti-democratic, and caustic to the legitimacy of government. Stripping people of their representation is destabilizing. That, btw, is the same notion as concentrating representation in the hands of fewer people. Also destabilizing.
Except for when Cubans get a debit card and housing from the US government as soon as they set foot in this country. Socialism for me and not for thee.
They only understand socialism in their own terms. This is their problem. The Republican party will exploit this fact and they will continue to support the Republican party of so-called conservatives.

Florida is a battleground, but republicans spend more than five times the money than the democrats, who have spent elsewhere, more effectively perhaps.

Furthermore, this was a mid-term election with a bad democratic candidate for governor (a former republican), and a hurricane in the heaviest democratic counties.

Florida is certainly pretty red now unfortunately, but the Democrats also have massive organization issues in the state and a candidate issue in the governor race specifically. Charlie Crist is a Republican turned independent turned Democrat who is constantly seeking power and no one actually likes him. The second they put him on the ballot they probably lost by an additional 10 points.

Crist is a terrible candidate who has lost every statewide race he ran in as a Democrat. He is a former Republican governor the party no longer wants and for some reason the Democrats think anyone else wants him (they don't).
Poland is the first country who claimed the missile was Russian. Still seems like the most obvious answer.
No, for enforcing the world order that does not allow for genocide -- which is what we are already dealing with. Your whole "all this war? for what?" is really misguided. We are already in this situation. And if things get out of control, it is squarely the fault of Russia who is constantly threatening to use nukes.

Russian state media constantly talks about striking NATO -- even hitting them first, nuking London etc. Don't you think this kind of belligerence will breed misunderstandings?

Also if Russia attacks Poland, it is not Ukraine's fault at all, in fact all of the blame for all of this belongs solely to Russia.

Uh, but Russia is responsible for the missile strike on Poland. If it was Ukrainian Air Defense missile that hit, they wouldn't have had to fire it if Russia wasn't bombing them.

Didn't they just say "Russian-made" and aren't many of the weapons that Ukraine is and has been using Russian-made?

NATO lying about the source doesn't make sense. Even if it was Russia that accidentally hit Poland, that doesn't force any action. Official response could be the same regardless.
It is also worth mentioning that Appalachia, and especially West Virginia, have political roots that are pretty damned hard left. Labor uprisings in the region did a lot for labor rights throughout much of the twentieth century. A huge number of younger Appalachians have come to proudly embrace that part of Appalachian history and culture while recognizing the systemic injustices and corporate exploitation that still plagues the region, and so there’s been a major revitalization of leftism here.
Although it wasn’t West Virginia, I grew up pretty close to there in one of the most poor and rural areas in Central Appalachia. I’m a younger millennial, just on the cusp of being Gen Z. From what I’ve observed, younger people tend to skew left in general - even in areas where older generations tend to be overwhelmingly conservative. If the Democratic Party continues to view traditionally red states as political monoliths, it would be a mistake of massive proportions.

Unfortunately they're not wrong... WV is deep red, and won't vote for a Dem senator again for a long time, unless there's a huge political re-alignment.

As a West Virginian, I can confidently say there's not a Republican in the state savvy enough to run against him. There are some moderates left here who vote for him every time. The Republicans always nominate the quackiest jackasses and lose big time. The Democrats may not like him, but they know they'll permanently lose the seat if they successfully primary him.
Kathy Griffin. What's interesting about that is that Democrats didn't rally to defend her. The joke was in poor taste and she was rightly called out for it. Also worth noting is that Kathy Griffin does not have the ability to bring about the violence she joked about. MTG is a member of congress who has actual institutional power. It's a very different kind of joke when you have the power to potentially make it happen.
For argument's sake let's give her the benefit of the doubt and say it was a joke. She joked that she would have made sure the rioters were armed so that they could successfully murder members of congress. Do you think Republicans would excuse a Democrat for joking about murdering Republicans?

Why is it that these republicans are always joking when they make these remarks but when a democrat says something (equivalent in outrage (fake outrage that is)) how dare them?

So "a joke" is defined as something that disgusts and outrages the sane members of society and makes the crazy right wingers all cheer, but lacks any element of humor?

Conservatives are so unfunny and have such a fucked sense of humor that they can use "it was a joke" as an excuse and not have to worry about their "joke" being funny or having a punchline.
Then Biden won and the White Christian Nationalist movement made eradication of trans people their path back into power. They've convinced a substantial portion of the country that we're baby-mutilating pedophile monsters, and that our existence is the product of a "social contagion" infecting healthy, normal (read: cis, normal) young people and turning them into worthless predatory degenerates.
Hell I transitioned 20 years ago. And for a long time it really seemed like things were slowly getting better. But holy fuck it's worse now than when I was a teenager.

They leave the law worded vaguely enough that they can pretend it's impartial, then use it to criminalize queer people's lives.

I think it's a bunch of bullshit how they're treating trans people, just don't think this is a workable angle.

I think trans people are the test case, if it works, all sorts LGBT and women's rights will be removed, obviously women have already lost reproductive rights in Texas.

This fight will probably end up in front of the Supreme Court eventually, and I have very little faith that they are going to rule in favor of trans people's medical rights.
In the video circulating you can see the Russian troops surrendering and then the last Russian soldier starts shooting injuring the cameraman, pretending to surrender and then attacking the other party is a war crime and makes those other soldiers an active threat, not POWs.
Yeah so the video is a sight to see there are two videos one first person where you’ll see the Russians surrendering and then their bozo companion runs out guns blazing while a soldier with a machine gun over watches them.

I've seen several videos like this, shot from Ukrainian body-cams, where the Russians pretend to surrender, then one pops up with a gun or grenade.

We've seen a Russian in the brush of the woods fake a surrender awhile ago near his 2-3 other comrades by pulling out a grenade, he was quickly shot by the Ukrainians and his grenade blew up on his body. The Ukrainian soldiers filming then said "Hey don't shoot these other guys" and then the video ends. These soldiers made the choice to kill the unarmed men out of either fear or anger because of the injury rambovich caused. I don't believe Perfidy applies to group based on the actions of one soldier, especially those who didnt take part. Whatever happened it was fucked up and horrible.

Edit: Their dead/dying bodies can be seen in this drone footage that people tried to claim was from mortarfire.

About a dozen POWs(technically just unarmed men) were executed because a single rambovich came out shooting and injured a Ukrainian soldier. Rambovich deserved to die, not the dozen or so men who were unarmed, had hands on their backs or heads and surrendered on their stomachs. Can't believe there are people here and on twitter who are excusing their possible reprisal execution because the last guy wanted to be rambo. Maybe they were caught in the crossfire but from the footage from the drone they clearly made sure to shoot every single guy in the head where they laid.

Then in the next video it’s an overhead view from a drone. On the ground you will see all the dead Russians.

This is called perfidy. They feinted a surrender. If there was a crazy guy back there with a gun the Russians should of said something. They didn’t. I would look at this as not a war crime. Consider that any one of those soldiers could of had a grenade or a pistol hidden prior to them walking out.
It doesn't matter if you know it's a lie. It doesn't matter if I know it's a lie. It doesn't matter if every reasonable person knows it's a lie. You are trying to prove that the persona telling the lie did so knowingly.
Politicians lie. They've been famous for doing that for long before social media was a thing. They've been famous for doing that long before the internet was a thing. They've been famous for doing that long before television was a thing. They've been famous for doing that long before radio was a thing. People expect politicians to lie, but people accept what the news tell them is true.

If they're going to hide behind the claim that they are an opinion show, strip them of their ability to call themselves a "News Network". We have false advertising laws in this country and it would seem having a "Fox News" logo in the corner of Tucker Carlson's show, that his lawyers argued in court wasn't news, should fit into a claim of false advertising pretty nicely.

There's no problem with the government forcing "news" agencies to issue retractions their viewers/readers will actually see. There's no problem with the FCC saying "you've been misleading your viewers, either maliciously or mistakenly, too frequently, so you're either going to make it right, stop calling yourself "news", or well pull your broadcasting license.".

Good point. Take out "knowingly" and maybe these dipshits will start doing some fact checking before opening their stupid face holes, to avoid the consequences.
I hate how much I’ve seen the 4x10 get talked about. No amount of extra day off is going to make me any more productive when working a 10-hour day.
In the UK a full time work week is a minimum of 35 hours, and if you worked 9-5 Monday to Friday it would be 7 hours a day plus an hour unpaid break.

The impression I got from my limited time in Sweden is people worked hard during the office hours and more generally arrived and left on time rather than putting unofficial hours in.

So 4 x 7 is exactly what was trialled here. It was four seven hour days with an hour unpaid lunch. So it's 32 hours if you count "time spent at physically work" but 28 hours if you count "time paid to be working".

What's more common is for people to take a week off at a time, maybe 2 weeks if they are going abroad. And then the rest of the time is just days here and there when they need it, plus public holidays.

"These studies show that hunter-gatherers need only work about fifteen to twenty hours a week in order to survive and may devote the rest of their time to leisure. Lee did not include food preparation time in his study, arguing that "work" should be defined as the time spent gathering enough food for sustenance.".

Yup. When I only have to go to my job 4 days a week (say Monday or Friday are holidays), I'm so much more motivated and interested in my job that week. Having only two days off per week to live your life can be a soul crusher.
You know people love to moralize about how the US or the West should stand up to the Saudis, it’s almost always comically misguided, betraying a total lack of understanding of just how pivotal KSA is in the current world order. Certainly Saudi Arabia has a lot of power and influence.
And seriously, the Muslim world already despises the US, that isn’t a threat, you already took out their skyscrapers.

According to logic, its illogical that the government of Saudi Arabia while still being a little weak in 2001 would provoke and attack its protector state (the US).

According to Occam's Razor, the simplest explanation is the more probable one, the US blames Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda claimed the Attack, how the fuck did Saudi Arabia turn out to be the preparators.

Even dismissing Ockham's razor as an analytical philosophy you can still use logic and reasoning to see that Saudi Arabia funding 9/11 (while possible) is still more unlikely than a group of extremists carrying it out independently. Like the other commenter stated during the gulf war the MAK (led by Osama bin laden and later called Al Qaeda) was looking to expand his jihadist movement to other parts of the Arab world after winning the war against the soviets. Bin laden offered to aid Saudi Arabia with troops to protect against the Iraqi army. King Fahd rejected this offer and opted instead for US aid (which likely angered a lot of sympathizers of bin Laden's cause in Saudi Arabia, hence the large number of Saudi Arabian nationals involved in the attack). This animosity towards the US getting involved in the Arab world is the most likely cause for the attacks and Bin Laden wouldn't necessarily need funding from Saudi Arabia to pull it off since he had plenty of allies to his cause.

Edit: I'll also add in this comment that the US and Saudi Arabia had been funding bin Ladens recruiting campaign in Arabia for the entire 80's while the mujahideen was fighting the soviets which would also explain the large number of Saudi Arabian nationals in bin Ladens militia.

According to real life, Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda hate the guts of the Saudi government, one of the main goals of Al-Qaeda was to remove the Saudi monarchy because it allowed US troops and American military base in Saudi Arabia. Something very Haram in Osama's mind.
Heinrich XIII, 71, belongs to the House of Reuss, an ancient royal lineage that ruled parts of what is now Thuringia in central Germany for hundreds of years until 1918. It is now one of Germany’s 16 federal states.
So even before 1918, he would not have been Kaiser. That would be the Hohenzollern family, who came to rule Brandenburg, became kings of Prussia and then Kaisers of Germany - from Wilhelm 1 (1871) to Wilhelm II (abdicated in 1918). There are living descendants of the family too.

Kings rule by divine right . Your ascent to the throne might see folks suggest that is heaven smiling upon you (Chinese have ) But you will find plenty of people willing to dispute the same. Until your power cows and winnows enough. Some other pedigree of legitimacy is usually found in the west. With enough power, often the documentation will follow. Or marriage alliances.

Reuss is just one of the many branches of German royalty, many of which have familial links across the rest of Europe, some of them to the British royal family.

They were not even at the same level of middling German family like the Wittlesbach of Bavaria, let alone the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasty.

There are a handful of German royal families that could make a semi legitimate claim to the throne if the throne was restored. His is not one of them by a long long ways.
Well, no disrespect to him, but since he jacked off on a Bible because he was captured by his own country, I imagine he would act in a similar way or worse if he was captured by a foreign country lol.
The soldier who claims he has PTSD from the training and is suing the government claims that he was forced to simulate sex acts with a toy doll and forced to renounce his Christian faith and masturbate over a Bible. Australia, are you cunts alright?

What he is saying is definitly plausible. Though as I said, they spend a few days with you explaining what you can expect and a way to tap out if you feel like things go too far.

Having said all this. Maybe there was some assholes running this course that ignored all the rules and just wanted to see some guy jerk it onto a book. I dont know, I wasn't there .

They tailor the experience to the individual. If he was a God botherer, then getting him to simulate a wank over a bible seems par for the course. Remember, the difference between a simulated sex act and an actual sex act is crucial.
She became an incomplete quadriplegic. She can’t stand too long. She can’t sit too long. She has a host of related issues. She can’t work.
you can't. my mom dealt with SS disability for 5 years before hers was approved, and they came up with 3 jobs she could do, 3 times over, just like this guy, and she had to appeal it 4 times thru her lawyer because those jobs didn't physically exist anymore. She finally asked for a different judge, and the judge finally granted it after the same bullshit. It cost her 5 years, and 12000 in lawyers fees to get her disability benefits. when the lawyer started filing paperwork to get challenge the constitutionality of the list of jobs, she was approved. this took 5 years. 5 years too long. the system was broken by republicans in the 1970's, and was done that way on purpose to make it impossible to get benefits you pay for and earned.

can't have the poor putting in too much money, need to encourage them to have a "private" retirement plan. the maximum was implemented in the 1980's when 401ks and other IRAs were becoming a thing, to encourage people to use the private sector, so the private sector could profit. its a scam.

its supposed to be, its supposed to make you quit trying. the suffering is the goal. its criminal, and likely unconstitutional, but you need a lawyer to work the system. its bullshit. it should not happen.
How many shootings are full on man in a school or store with a gun murdering indiscriminately? I'm sure that's less that 3% of shootings. Of course people aren't stopping drive bys or stuff like that. You wanna use stats, use them correctly.
Technically it has. Guns have been allowed for 250 years in this country and I'm pretty sure crime has been on a steady decline since the early 90s. Never even got more violent after the AWB ran out of time.

That's still the same, they do stop them sometimes. Maybe people just need to stop shooting places up and then people not even from the US wouldn't want to change rights that don't affect them?

Eeh, ours are just as bad if not worse. That militarization of police that has been creating so many problems in the US? Happened to us in the early 70's. We have the most lethal police in the world and 68% of the population fears the police.
I'm all for training and licensing for owning a gun just like driver's licenses. However, just like driver's licenses a state should develop an agency that handles the training and licensing not just expect the police to do it. As someone who supports defunding the police and stopping them from doing the jobs of social worker and mental health professionals, why on earth would I want them to have to do this job too?
Imagine if you will that they passed gun licensing laws like I suggest and then the nearest licensing center was 100 miles away. That's what states do with voter ID laws.

Why depend on State to issue ID for a Federal election? Fed election law should mandate accepting an array of alternative ID for Federal office election, including a RealID issued by Federal Govt, pictures taken etc at any Post Office (as well as whatever the State wants to accept for its own concurrent elections).

P.S. I am from Turkey where I can openly declare my atheism and women can freely walk around without veils, where all legally recognized marriages are still only civil marriages, where it is still illegal for religion to be a basis for discrimination, where abortion is not illegal, where sharia has no effect at all, let alone over the civil code. Consider that Erdoğan had 20 YEARS to change this, but didn’t or couldn’t. Consider for a moment there is more to the story than what you’re privy to.
That said, I am familiar with the sort of denial you refer to, unfortunately. Perhaps it is ingrained and that is exactly what I'm doing. Who knows? .

And still is. There might be more religious undertones and more politicians calling for religion-inspired laws, but like the US it remains a secular government even if individuals within it act on their religious beliefs.

Freedom of religion should permit you to hold any religious belief and protects your right to practice it, but it should not ever include censorship of those who'd want to critique it by political manifestations.

Ignoring for a moment this was purposefully done in front of the Turkish mission, probably not - but I'd personally argue ensuring religious freedom is a core obligation of any modern state, and permitting or acquiescing to a blatant attack against any religion in the public arena does not track with that. There are more nuanced and moderate ways to level criticism. Not to mention, Erdoğan's stance in this instance has nothing to do with Islam, so I'm unclear what you would be criticizing here by burning a Quran.

That doesn’t mean burning a Quran in protest of Turkey is not a political act in of itself. Erdoğan can’t not respond to such an act given his stance, which will be politically detrimental to him in the eyes of his voters.

"Erdogan can't not respond" well he definatly can ignore a lunatic troublemaker but he choose to do so that he can try to squeeze out tha maximum out of the situation. He is playing a dangerous game putting his own interests before Natos.
Heh. My grandfather lived through that. One of the things he did to keep his siblings and himself alive (they were still kids when my great grandfather died - they didn't have anything and we're too young to work the farm) was to mentally map the floor plan of the store. Then, that night, he returned with his sister.
Iirc, some models of hybrid American pickup trucks work that way - they're designed to operate as a worksite generator and, if equipped, sometimes feature a 240v, 30amp connection. ... Heck, one guy I know has a regular has powered pickup and he has that ability.

Yeah. I think being a "competent" tsar of Russia meant you had to be able to ruthlessly put down reformers (of which they were many). You also had to have some good policy ideas, but it doesn't matter too much if you can't even stop a peasant rebellion.
I understand people get paid to make anti-drug propaganda, police may earn commissions on drug busts, etc. but that's tax revenue being diverted (ie, the people paying for their own oppression).
The interest should be with government as this is a (major) new tax revenue source... so I assume politicians being paid to block it, as this blatantly goes against public health and interest.

There's been plenty research already and the numbers are conclusive. There's much more merit, and far less danger than people have been led to believe.

Sure they can capitalise on this new market (which i have no doubt they will). But, once the levy breaks, they will have much more competition. It will become a seller's market since growing Cannabis is plenty easier and safer than setting up an alcohol destillary and hence harder to control.

At the moment there is a medicinal cannabis route in the UK, but for some reason privately (not as part of NHS), costly and downright invasive to attempt getting a license. Furthermore most police officers aren't even aware this license exists in certain parts of the country.
It didn’t start with Trump (I’d say Rush Limbaugh had a running start) but Trump sure normalized the fuck out of hate speech against every minority group. He’s nothing but a misogynistic, racist bigot.

Florida is racing to the bottom when it comes to public education. This feels like the Nancy DeVos model which will devolve public education to a voucher system where kids will attend private schools and charter schools regardless of the evidence that they don’t help the students who are most in need.

Nah, the plan is to take away money from public schools, give it to Christian charter schools, and force poor people to send their children to those schools in the hopes they will become indoctrinated into good gay/abortion hating Christian nationalists.
Whenever there's a cold/windy day, trace your hands around the window to feel for cold air. You can also visually check for condensation lines around areas where your window moves/tracks for proof of steep temperature gradients and need for something to stop the draft.
Having a single pane glass isn't great, but it's a million times better than double/triple pane with 0 insulation around the frame and allowing draft to enter the home.

If you're still on single pane windows it's worth upgrading, but the improvement from double to triple pane is not big enough to justify the cost usually. At least not compared to other insulation measures.

Replacing your old windows without also improving your home's insulation is a recipe for mold problems. The windows should be the coldest point in the room, otherwise the moisture will cling to the walls.

i actually looked into getting one but as it turns out, they are not suitable for old, badly insulated buildings with little radiator surface.(which is the vast majority of German buildings).
He wouldn't be. A defendant that ONLY possesses a pound of weed could be charged with simple possession which has a maximum of one year incarceration. If the federal prosecutors can prove the defendant intended to distribute or sale that one pound the maximum penalty would be five years incarceration.
A January article padded with rampantly incorrect information - nevermind, the defendant received 11 years (well the court adjudicated the sentence in months) instead of three years as the law professor speculated.

That's policy. Now COVID complications and federal prison camps (especially camps with drug programs) being full complicate placement. That fictitious prisoner could be placed into a low security prison until an opening becomes available.

Part of the reason most white collar criminals are placed into low security prisons is because those prisons are CHEAPER per inmate.

TBH, no sensible government would waste $$$ putting an almost certainly nonviolent inmate in a high security prison.
Every action DeSantis takes is basically this calculus: "Will this energize Republican voters if Fox News talks about it?".
I get it. I’m afraid of lingering problems from covid too. But I’m under no illusions about post covid symptoms being caused by the vaccine not covid itself. People need to remember what 2020 was like. I know people who still have fatigue and brain fog from that period. Covid is a nasty virus, and it isn’t done with us. We’ve all just trying to live.. the science will catch up, but maybe not in time for us. It’s been like this for all humans across all times and places.

I moved to Tampa Bay after graduating from UF fifteen or so years ago. Some of my friends stayed in Gainesville. My Gainesville friends seem to have no idea what life is like in Florida outside the blue bubble. It’s both funny and concerning. I saw a Dr. Seuss parody bumper sticker here in Tampa yesterday that said “one gun, two gun, red gun, blue gun.” When I showed my Gainesville friend, she was like… I don’t even know what that means??? Haha Well, there are large groups of maladapted, social media addicted loonies. You avoid them when you can.

My wife’s coworker is suffering from long covid despite having been vaccinated. All of us know that that’s a thing. Most of us probably also know these are first generation vaccines and that the tech will improve but there’s going to be a lot of death and suffering before it does. That’s life.

Here’s the plan: Long covid is messing people up, but it’s super inconvenient to acknowledge that a sizable portion of the population can be crippled for a short time or a long time by an air borne disease and that there’s not much we can do about it. That’s scary. But if you tell people all of their lingering symptoms are from the vaccine, not from illness, then people have someone to demonize (“big pharma”, Fauci, liberals, whatever). That energy can be turned into political gain for DeSantis. He’s done it before.

Oh but it is not just him. And it is not just advice. His choice for FL Surgeon General is a total quack MD, raging against masks & vaccines. The person responsible for medical oversight in the state! Legally he has taken direct action as well- preventing nursing homes for restricting visitation during the height of covid. Actively firing school officials that enacted masking protocols. He has been willing & successful to enact legal punitive damage to those that go against him, and his base just eats it up. he is the closest we have ever seen to fascism, and no one seems to care.
Who’s we? These will be a Eurofighter replacement, likely akin to the F-22, that won’t have a production line for a decade. It probably won’t be a mainstay aircraft, and all the partner nations already operate F-35. Japan just ordered like 40 more. Waiting 10 years to buy aircraft that barely exist right now instead of waiting an extra year or so for F-35 just isn’t what’s happening.
There is a reason the F-22 is so ahead of everything else and we still barely produce and use them. They are outdated in 2022.

I don't understand this. Yes, noone can compete in dogfights with the F-22 and we don't export the F-22, but noone is dogfighting with jets.

I would also add there are indeed jets that could compete in a dogfight with the F22. The Su-57 for example would absolutely hold a candle to the F22 in a dogfight. Where the F22 has the advantage though is it's stealth capability. Making a dogfight unnecessary.

The last F22s ever made were actually built in 2011. They are certainly not "so ahead of everything else". In fact they are slated to be completely retired by 2030 due to their extremely high operating cost, limited range, outdated avionics and the availability of newer/better stealth technology.
This isn’t about Jewish voters, it’s about messaging to Evangelical zionists. American Jews vote Democratic pretty overwhelmingly, and aren’t that big a demographic. Any time Republicans appear to be speaking to or about American Jews, they’re really just messaging to Christians about Israel or attempting to their own party’s antisemitism problem.
Because when they act like they're pandering to the Jews they're really pandering to Evangelicals who believe Jews need to control Israel before Jesus can come back.

Also, many anti-semites actually support a nation of israel, that way they can have a reason to try and pressure Jews in their country to move somewhere else.

I guess it doesn't help that instead of supporting the Zionist left, the left in the world seems to go further and further into antizionism - rejecting Israel's right to exist at all. Hard to convince Israelis there's a chance for peace when your entire existance and right to live is questioned and not your policies. And I know that because I am one of the few who still vote left.

As an Israeli Jew, unfrotunately you are wrong. This doesn't hold if you look only at American Jews- but globally speaking, and even moreso in Israel, the younger you look the more right wingers you'll see. In fact, iirc, Israeli youth leans furthest to the right in the OECD, after hungary.
Even independent artists need to understand the difference between needs and wants before arguing for more money. Most of them are paying upwards of $2,000 per month just to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. These are the people who constantly complain about 'needing' more money when in reality they just need to learn how to spend less. But spending less isn't as sexy as getting more, so very few people actually consider it.

Easily two of the top greatest emotional traumaz someone can go through is abandonment or banishment from one's own "in-group", and enduring life or death violence.

If police did die, they'd just say "well only X number did" or "well only the cowardly/traitorous ones", because their position is that they are always right, quick someone bullshit a justification, so fuck em all together.

Similarly, if that same cop chose to take on the mob, got beaten to a pulp and died a week later in the hospital, we'd agree that was in the line of duty even though he didn't actually die while "at work" right?

I remember in the late 80s bookstores with any kind of Media Criticism section had a shelf groaning with books about the coming News Apocalypse. The news was fake for nearly 25 years before Trump announced that any media criticizing him was “fake news.” Typically, conservatives will take 25 years to get on board with changing circumstances - once their misinterpretation of the consequences will fit on a bumper sticker.

Trump absolutely was a follower, not a leader, and he smartly learned in the primaries that just repeating Limbaugh talking points and validating his base was all they really wanted. He just had to ride the wave.

It’s sad, I used to think “At least there’s probably virtuous and good wealthy billionaires who can counter the bad ones”, but now I’ve finally accepted that anyone who reaches this kind of status has to be a sociopath of some kind. Rupert Murdock has only increasingly succeeded with his propaganda machine, and the other media moguls instead have pivoted to “how can we get in on that action”. They will not save us from their own greed.
Is there a US law that prevents US military to be stationed at the border? I see so many nations have their army patrolling and guarding the border like in EU, China, India, Africa. Whats stopping USA from posting troops on its own southern border?
In short, Posse Comitatus does not prevent the use of US armed forces for border security. If it did .

Federally-activated National Guard. In other words, (which covers nationalized troops) rather than (state level NG). Two separate sections of US Code, one covers active, federal, military (those covered by Posse Comitatus) and state militia (national guard) that is not. This is how NG troops were used in GWOT, and deployed to Afghanistan.

Yes, cut off the drug money, most of the money goes the cartel. If violence erupts from that, then it's the Mexican goverment's responsibility to deal with that. And, violence already happens on a daily basis in Mexico from narco infighting anyway.
All of these people in LCOL red states are big mad that Californians and New Yorkers are moving to their states, outbidding them on houses and services, but none of them ever stop and consider why all these people from blue states are so much better off than them in the first place.
I'd imagine the majority of the ones leaving are republicans. It doesn't matter though, red or blue, they all benefited from the same Californian policies.

Read the bill. What it does is classify hate crimes as a crime punishable under already existing conspiracy laws, and subject to the same restrictions. Yes, conspiracy to commit a crime once it meets certain criteria is no longer protected under the First Amendment.

There were two bills. One that required the rail workers to work under the agreed wage increase agreed by the workers and 8/12 of the unions and another bill to give the rail workers paid sick leave.
But, of course, it was Biden's fault... Definitely not the Republicans that voted for the corporations and deny the workers simple paid sick leave.

Why isn't anyone upset about every GOP house rep voting against the 2020 bill enshrining paid leave for all full time workers? How about the Senate GOP filibustering the same bill? Democratic reps and senators overwhelmingly supported those.

That failed bill, and many before it, lets essential industries like rail and trucking continue to avoid paying for reasonable sick leave.

Which then would have resulted in a strike which would have been catastrophic for the economy forcing the rail road companies to the table or forcing Republicans to pass the bill with sick leave. Forcing a contract on the union and taking away their right to strike is morally repugnant. By splitting it into two bills the Democrats knew this would happen. Ultimately they didn't think railroad worker sick leave was worth actually fighting for.
2] In most cases, no corrections issued and absolutely zero fact finding or investigations before breaking the story same as Masha Amini's death where France24 and Guardian straight up claimed that they have medical records and sources who actually saw her beaten in a jail, then later "corrected" that she was "beaten up in custody" where there's still no proof and where they let the story sit there with all of the information being "allegations" and "sources claimed".
Like it's hilarious how the US has the balls to literally say anything despite using depleted uranium ammo. Like if that isn't a nuclear weapon, I don't know what is.

It's not... nuclear weapons utilize fission or fusion to create explosions. DU isn't used that way at all. It's used in armor piercing ammunition and tank armor because it is hard and dense, and in ammunition is self-sharpening.

The cliche example being the Sherman tank, 50,000 made, not the best gun or armor but good enough to take out most tanks and do its role. Germany having a superior medium tank on paper with the Panther didn't count for much.
A non-binding referendum is, legally speaking, not binding. It can therefore be assumed that such a referendum must have some utility beyond a mandate made to the government. Can we layfolk think of one? What about a process to solicit feedback in the form of personal responses to a spitball proposal? What about a way to ask the public if it's worthwhile committing to research into a particular proposal when said research would utilize significant government resources and incur significant costs (to be covered by taxpayers)?
What actually happened was an absolutely pathetic and miserable abdication of duty. The government did not function whatsoever. It fell into the trap of bureaucracy and did what the referendum dictated despite not being bound by the results just because a slight margin said to do it, with nowhere near a complete appreciation for the actual consequences or even how deep the UK's fingers really were in the EU cookie jar. The buffoons rubber stamped Brexit.

Private equity is also buying up mobile home parks, raising the rent, evicting those who can't pay - rinse and repeat. It is an assault on those with limited incomes like the elderly, single parents, etc.
Amid a national housing crisis, giant private equity firms have been buying up apartment buildings en masse to squeeze them for profit, with the help of government-backed Freddie Mac. Meanwhile, tenants say they’re the ones paying the price.

Yes, but they're only buying because they can get more in rent than their mortgage. That's due to the supply of housing.

There's nothing in my post that argues against supply and demand. Supply is and has been deliberately restricted, both by our ruling class, and NIMBYs, and small time landlords.

The reality is that average people are the ones who lobbied the government to restrict supply. Large investors were actually pretty late to the party, only buying up a small share of the housing stock well after regulations had created higher prices.
If you lived here you would know that the tv ad campaign mentioned only a "high compacity" magazines and said absolutely nothing about law enforcement getting the final say on who could and could not own a firearm.
I'm well aware, but I still think that many ardent gun control supporters would still have voted for it knowing that it would effectively ban gun sales in OR for the foreseeable future because they see that as a good thing.

It’s a distributed database that allows for the government to track a specific firearm, but prevents it from pulling up a list of people who own a specific type of firearm. They can, with some work, take a firearm that was recovered from a crime scene and trace that back to the person who purchased it from the store. But if the government were to ban, say, assault weapons, it would be infeasible to pull up a list of AR-15 owners and go knocking on doors.

It passed by a very narrow margin and it was not well-understood that the police could unilaterally bar an individual from owning guns (or delay issuing permits). The police bureau is extremely unpopular in Portland and if people here had been made better aware of that fact it absolutely would have been enough to tilt the scales.
I heard Poland is yet to submit the request to Germany in the first place, which would be extremely ridiculous to say the least. Don't give the Russians the time to regroup and resupply! This war is catastrophic to Ukraine and its people, and costly to a world recovering from a global pandemic..
Send enough armor and weapons to Ukraine and let them kick those fuckin Russians back to Moscow so they can topple Putin and get it over with.

If Germany were to actually consider the media report a valid request and approve it, the next time some politician in Poland talks to the media would need to be considered valid as well? Or only for members of the cabinet? What if it's just local press at some evening event with alcohol? Or a demand of Germany twittered by an attendee of the event? Do they need to monitor that and respond to it as well?
Once they all realize that their badge doesn't shield them from consequences we'll see a drastic change in how police act in this country.
The core problem is the police need to make changes AND acknowledge that they need to earn our trust back because their bullshit isn't isolated incidents it's everywhere.

I think you underestimate how hard it is to police a distrusting to down right hostile populous. Which is why they have a history of doing what they do in these situations. Again I'm not defending the police I personally have my own reasons for not trusting the police.

The onus isn't on the people to trust the cops, it's on the cops to act trustworthy. It's not a negotiation. It's not even a dialogue. People trust the cops, or don't, based on how they act.

We don’t need to give them anything, they have the authority. How much would you like to bet that they’ll continue to use that authority in ways that don’t foster trust?
There is this thing called history. Territorial boundaries are easy, but cultural boundaries are not. Lots of places in Europe have cultures that overlap territorial boundaries. The Crimea and Ukraine are just one.
You should probably look at the history of Crimea. It isn't really so simple. Crimea was mostly Russians for the past 100 years and few Ukrainians. Even before the USSR Crimea wasn't very populated by Ukrainians.

During the USSR Kruschev added Crimea to Ukraine but it didn't really matter since it was the USSR. Following the dissolution of the USSR there were many Russians, and the population of Crimea was mostly Russians who were left unable to return home. Crimea attempted twice in the 90s to become independent from Ukraine with the intention of returning to be part of Russia.

What are your thoughts on Crimea seeking twice in the 90s to declare independence from Ukraine and Ukraine denying their independence? The intention was for Crimea to return to Russia at that point by way of Crimean self-determination.

I think the real tricky question is what to do with the ethnic Russians who lived in Crimea before Russia's annexation. They were Ukrainian citizens and legally probably still are.

You're right to point out the fact that even before USSR Ukrainians were a minority in Crimea. You curiously omit the glaring fact that before the USSR Russians were not a majority in Crimea as well - judging by 1897 census data at least. The majority - Crimean Tatars - were cultivating much longer ties to that land than Russians can claim. Should we give the peninsula back to Tatars, by this logic?
No, it's because its a second crime for her, for most of these people if not all, its their first crime. It's amazing how we argue for lighter sentences for people then decide we don't like what lighter sentences look like when they're handed down.
If you want to be technical about it, casting a ballot with the intent for the vote to be counted, if you're ineligible is a crime.

A provisional ballot literally means: “I’d like to vote, and this is what I would vote, but hey government, please check if I’m eligible and if yes, then please register my vote. If not, please disregard it.” So where’s the criminal intent?

That is not evidence of intent to commit a crime. That is intent to vote. If she intended to commit a crime, such as with these other assholes, that would be worthy of punishment.

What these examples actually show is that when would-be criminals try to cheat, the existing system is strong enough to catch and prosecute them. This doesn’t prove the need for new voter-suppression laws; it helps prove the opposite.
A year? This has been going on for at least a decade. The West has a weird fetish with claiming Putin has dementia/Parkinson's/Cancer, etc.
They did not claim Putin was in perfect health, every comment they made focused on claims that were speculating on severe illnesses like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's etc.

Why do I feel that Western stories about Putin's health are Russian propaganda designed to enable Putin to fake his own death and escape to Venezuela?

How did this escalate to "fuck off, Putin-propaganda, strawman fallacy" talk? The way I see it, they took your reply as supportive of the rumors so he kept going on the same angle. I can see how you would feel they ignored what you were saying, or that they were mocking anyone believing Putin is sick in some way.

Personally I like the idea that Putin is secretly quite sick, and I don't think the rumors do harm because they are also harming Putin's image. But I also don't think being annoyed by what are essentially rumors, and a long pattern of them means that someone is a Putinist.
Problem: In neighboring Guyana there was colonialism, too. After that Black and Indians subdued each other. Better? Who apologizes now.
What has happened has happened, you just need to find a way to move on and an apology is a very good first step.

But either way, an apology under any circumstance is never meant to undo anything. It’s symbolic, it’s done to acknowledge wrongdoing, to heal and to show that you’ve learnt your actions have hurt someone. An apology has never ever been able to fix the past, so I really don’t understand why you would have an issue with this.

Any apology and recognition of the mistakes of the past will make it better for the future that is being planned. Good thing that Netherlands has done it.

I hope other colonial powers(English, French, Spain and Portugal) starts apologising and returning the loot and artefacts of African, South American and south Asian countries.

And before sending any artifact back, maybe we should make sure that they aren't lynching their own people for being a different colour (looking at you South Africa), and maybe start building a developed country? Because i'm 100% sure those artifacts would just be stolen and sold to the medium bidder.
if you think somehow the ignorant voters are going to suddenly replace ousted candidates with better options, then you are sorely mistaken, or you have such a low opinion of current candidates that you think "everything must be better".
It's pretty hard to believe that people are consciously voting for Johnson and a Democratic governor, AG, and SoS...so, if you ask me, I feel like the majority of people here are just morons voting for the incumbents.

Gerrymandering affects statewide elections as well, because if the majority of your votes feels meaningless because of it, why turn out at all?

The top 20% income earners receive $764 billion per year from the tax code deductions and credits. The top 1% receive $313 billion per year.
“Tax expenditures” are subsidies delivered through the tax code as deductions, exclusions, and other tax preferences. In fiscal year 2019, tax expenditures reduced federal income tax revenue by roughly $1.3 trillion.

They aren't honest that's why they are losing power in DC, if you look at the numbers 90% of the deficit in 2024 in tax evasion and the top 1% of income earners also get back an additional $313 billion per year in deductions and credits.

Tax expenditures are costly. For comparison, the cost of all federal income tax expenditures was higher than Social Security, the combined cost of Medicare and Medicaid, or the cost of either defense or non-defense discretionary spending.

If you continue to cut taxes on the rich and corporations, continue hand outs of corporate welfare and continue to increase the military budget and complain about deficits, you aren’t really serious about deficits. We’re not having it anymore. We see you 1%ers. We’re coming for you - politically. ✊.
No. The authority of the executive to discharge this debt is rock solid, regardless of what Pelosi, the Republicans, or Biden himself has said. The current lawsuits- and any that would arise from completely cancelling and discharging student loan debt- have no standing at all. The correct move would have been to cancel it all, effective immediately, and then tell the courts to come and collect if they want my $20k back.
They don't though, and just because you and a few other people say so in bad faith doesn't make it so.

it's not an EO, it's using executive authority as granted by the HEROES act that allows the Secretary of Education to waive debt during wars or national emregencies (like global pandemics).

No it isn't. Piecemeal cancelling and then stopping the process for groundless judicial stays is not "cancelling it outright." If Trump's judges are illegitimate so are their rulings.

We can say judges are illegitimate all day long but they are ruling from a platform of legitimacy. And the best way to change that is through congress chambers.
In any army, a ton of manpower is spent on non-combat roles: truck drivers, military police, construction, guarding supply lines, and also patrolling and protecting the country’s borders. With a peacetime army, I’d be wasting trained soldiers escorting supply convoys, protecting rear areas, and just loading and unloading shit on and off trains and trucks. If I had a ton of new conscripts, I’d put my conscripts in these roles and move the trained soldiers to the front lines. I’d also use conscripts to guard non-conflict borders and move the combat troops from there to the front lines.
It's not as simple as shifting the best soldiers to the frontline and replacing them with untrained conscripts. The conscripts might decide it's better to fight for their own freedom instead of some vague objective in Ukraine, particularly if all the "real" troops are busy at the frontline.

The thing is - before the mobilization occurred a lot of Russians thought of war as a place where they'll go, fight a little bit and get awards.

This isn't any major rebellion, but at the very least it shows that Russians are getting aware of what is really happening.

They didn't really think of it as a place of death, suffering and despair. But now they understand the truth since their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers are on the battlefield - and they also find out some information about the state and how it lies to them.
Fuck no on Harris. I mean, fuuuuuuuck no. When she was the first to drop out of the last Dem primary with 1-3% support, she shouldve never even been VP imo.
You make good points but I think many moderate, centrist Dems are really not getting, even now, that millions of people voted to get the former piece of trash out of the presidency. Biden would certainly win again against Trump but DeSantis? Enough low-info “indepedent” voters would “give him a chance” over Biden.

The people who lost to POTUS Joe Biden I'm not sure would somehow be a better Presidential candidate than he. US Senator Bernie Sanders lost because the Mainstream Media was so against him and US Senator Elizabeth Warren didn't drop out when the others did. US Senator Sanders would have beaten Donald Trump in 2016 and we would have presently been in the 2nd term of the Sanders Administration.

Even if all of that is taken as b.s., the DNC will never, ever allow a person like Bernie to win as evidenced by that nonsense during the last primary where every candidate dropped out right as Sanders got momentum to rally behind Biden.

That is just silly and ridiculous, and it is hard to believe any of the people who claim to be Bernie Sanders supporters while promoting that stuff.

1. Voter outreach is crucial, but not enough on its own. New and additional strategies are required.
If you want an example on the left of what happens when you don't reach out to those who don't agree with you, look at Bernie Sanders' Presidential campaigns. Bernie never expanded his base of support much beyond young upper middle class White liberals because he didn't reach out to establishment Democrats, or temper his campaign message to appeal to moderates, or vary his stump speech to speak to the concerns of a varied electorate. Bernie expected voters to come to him and it doesn't work that way; one of the critiques I remember from his 2016 campaign was that his phone volunteers were more interested in winning arguments with the people they were calling than they were interesting in making more calls and swaying more voters.

Yep. Essentially a bunch of wealthy, geriatric capitalists with a leaning towards social justice but not at the expense of their pocketbook.
Not necessarily. If Ukraine negotiates, Russia might only be able to keep the territory it controls now. Ukraine would still stand between Russia and Moldova. Your theory is essentially the "domino theory" that kept us in Vietnam for a decade.
Right up until Russia starts using nukes. The greatest chance of nuclear weapons being unleashed has always been if a nuclear power starts losing a war. I hope Ukraine wins, but it's not worth WW3.

Oh, piss off. If Putin loses, he's most likely literally dead. You're willing to risk WW3 betting on the rationality of a narcissistic dictator who knows he's doomed. That doesn't even take into account that the US is unlikely to use strategic nukes in response to Putin's use of tactical nukes.

While I believe that he is correct in his assessment of the situation (that heavy weapons will be needed to defeat russia), one does not simply get war ships and air forces. It would be far, far more effective to ask for an umbrella of protection from NATO.

Personally, I do not think this war has a path to conclusion that does not include the destruction of russian leadership. And THAT is where the biggest problem lies... current russian leadership would rather commit global suicide than surrender power.
>Serbia will ask NATO peacemakers to let it deploy Serbian military and police in Kosovo, although it believes there is no chance of the request being approved, President Aleksandar Vucic said on Saturday.
There’s a part of the resolution that lets NATO allow a few Serbian troops to help defend Orthodox sites and some Serbian majority areas.

By agreement and UN Resolution 1244, serbs have right to deploy no more than1000 soldiers or policeman In Kosovo . US and EU do recognize that. However serbs never use that. Until now, but what is the reason?

Because , no matter of deckared independence of Kosovo and recignition , Kosovo is not recognized bu UN and its not a member of. Resolution that give serbs right to send no more than 1000 servicemen is UN resolution. So the right to return is undesputable.
She's been critical of Israel & AIPAC, was in favor of boycotting products from the colonized areas and a Muslim. Therefor she's a great target for them to pretend antisemitism is a leftist thing.
The worst thing she did is word some of her criticism a bit unfortunate or clunky. But for Republicans criticism of Israel is antisemitic, while maligning Jews in your own country isn't.

Omar has criticized Israel in the past so the new Republican leadership said "We won't stand for anti-semites! 😤😤😤" And kicked her off her committees. Meanwhile the actual anti-semite Republicans are given their choice of positions.

Smart Republicans care about electability, but they're in the minority. Most Republicans want racism, little dances, and insulting nicknames. If you promise to hurt the people they hate, they'll love you forever.

I think you're right. Trump will crush him, to the dismay of party leaders. He has a power over stupid people that is not of this world. It's the racism, the little dances, the exaggerated facial expressions, something.
Bibi is a pure political beast and the electorate of Israel has changed dramatically due to population trends. It's kinda like Idiocracy, but with religion. The various levels of orthodox Judaism is all about massive families and gaming the system. Where center and left leaning Jews tend to have smaller families. Mix in Bibi who will adapt to whoever gives him the power, and you get modern Israel.
The big inflection point will be when the collective Orthodox groups possibly crush the system with their population. They are generally pro-conflict but dodge conscription. They are big segment of the welfare population. And to avoid the conscription, many go into religious schooling. So they aren't generating as much gdp. At some point, there might be a large outflow of Israelis because the system is stacked in favor of Orthodoxy.

Most Israelis are against expanding settlements, it is being done to get the favor of the far-right. So most Israelis then vote far-right, which will most likely expand the settlements even further, which will fuel even more retaliation from palestine, and yes, that includes rocket launches and 'terror attacks" from the people whose land and homes Israel has illegally taken - which is what Israelis are so scared of that they keep electing the far right.

In the period where the majority of countries in the middle east have warm ties with israel and relations are the best theyve ever been they vote in the most right wing anti arab govt in israeli history… Probably not the best move.

The USA literally supported a dictatorship here that suppressed our people in the past. I dont like Iran either but geopolitics isnt a friendship game. If your country doesnt like Iran just invade them already and handle the consequences yourselves.
We dont need your "democracy" also known as coups, discrimination and some of your own political shenanigans (that were imported to here by a certain ex "president" of ours). China and Russia are just as terrible but its better to be on the neutral side and reap from both beds than to become a puppet of either side.

Everyone suffers if nukes star flying around. It just devastates both sides, and Putin is willing to go down swinging, in that sense it's better to not star world war 3.

Russians have just created a new hot-spot in the world, and its resolution will rest on a total defeat of one of the parties. After this, normal coexistence is no longer possible and Putin is counting on future Russian leaders to be aware of this and pursue his policy until one of the following:

Russian leadership is pushing its own country into the corner. Now it's all or nothing for Russia, because if, after this, they only go for a partial occupation of Ukraine and call it quits, they can be 100% sure Ukraine will try to massively remilitarize and enact revenge (unless Russia succeeds in removing the current Ukrainian leadership and force Ukraine to accept unfavourable terms, like perpetual neutrality).

Previous top Russian general was fond of Power Grid destruction… it did not help much, so he was replaced with one who prefers to go for civilian casualties in most direct way… neither “strategies” (for the lack of better word) make any sense… but at this point no strategy which does not include removal of Putin and withdrawal from Ukrainian territory would make sense. And there is no one in Russian “power structures” with balls to do it.

This is important to remember with Russia. We project humanity on them. They project their unique Russian point of view onto everyone else.
Just checked our guidelines are you’re correct, there is no intermediary fees for banks in PSD (replaced by PSD2) Which is ofc an EU directive. Otherwise payments outside PSD jurisdiction may be subject to the following:
As someone who works at a bank, there absolutely usually is a fee to transfer money between banks internationally - in the UK it’s typically £25. You’re mistaking it for a card payment where typically its down to how you choose to have the exchange rate worked out (i.e by the merchant or your bank) but other than an exchange fee of a couple quid, there’s no real fee for transacting internationally. Some banks even offer no fee for transactions in certain areas (e.g I think Monzo allows for no fees in Europe, Starling is the same for US?).

Great. So any ambassadors who get called to Turkey to talk about this, simply start out with “Russia is doing this, you know this, we don’t have anything to talk about.“.

If I were Turkish I'd be embarrassed, but I know enough Turkish people to know most are going to just double down or disregard. Religious ire seems to fill the void Erdogan left in their wallets.
Hmmmm let's see. US likely keeps its global status as Super Power or the biggest world power and most powerful country for decades to come. Most countries around China are in fact US allies or countries that don't really like China. Countries bordering US aren't Chinese allies and as much as others may not acknowledge it, the US controls all of the Americas. US will continue to be the most dominant country the world has ever seen until the US makes itself self-destruct and even then, it will still always be a major global power in the world.
This will pretty much the future of American global economy domination, not by compete to win, but by trying to choke China and hope they lose more than us, so we "won". Step by step, we will corner China so they have to make everything by themselves, then we will run out of things for choking.

From business perspective, this is a great "win" for America, relatively speaking. Sure, Intel and AMD may lose some market shares, but in general America "won" by making China endures and Taiwan/Dutch lose a lot.

When we run out of things economically to choke them, that is when bad things start to fly. We will then "corner" them into a war so hopefully we come out on top, the best scenario could be a proxy war and I wonder who is the best proxy near China, hmmmm.
They could hardly have stated it more clearly if they'd painted themselves purple and danced naked on top of a harpsichord, singing 'We've just run out of rockets.'.
Yep. It kinda reminds me of when I have a bag of potato chips and its almost empty. I might just want a handful of chips but there is about 2 handfuls left in the bag. So I end up just finishing off the bag.

Also with all of their air defenses sending 1-2 out isnt a good idea since they can get picked off so they are forced to launch swarm attacks in hopes of over whelming their air defenses.

And you mentioned it being part of an IAD, the missile you fire with one of those systems cost orders of magnitude more than the drone they are shooting down. Even a Stinger is one order of magnitude more. That’s why people keep going back to gun system, but you need a shit ton of them to protect infrastructure.

Short range as in like 2km, and the can move at 45km/hr. It’s not a system use use to intercept incoming attacks, it’s a system you take with your armored columns to rip apart Soviet helicopters or keep around your base to shoot down anything that gets through the missile systems of your IAD.

This is why drone warfare is difficult to defend against: quantity has it’s own quality, and if it cost you more to shoot down than for them to send they win the economic exchange.

The more pressing problem is finding a mass-produced and reliable counter to cheap Iranian drones which (sometimes) do the same thing at a small fraction of the cost of a cruise missile, and shooting down which costs Ukraine far more than the drone. Probably a lot of truck-mounted machine-gun AAs, WW2-style.
The modern American judicial system: Religious nutbags for judges and no real standing necessary anymore. Also god forbid someone want birth control for the numerous other things it helps with besides pregnancy.
I mean, it’s not like hormonal birth control’s only side effect is preventing pregnancy. It can have some serious and far reaching negative effects like if administered inappropriately. Not to mention the very common effects like headaches, bloating, weight gain, and acne.

I do think there should be a line drawn as to when we allow teens to make medical decisions for themselves. Do I think a 13-15 year old should have a child? No. Do I think that an already hormonal teenager should just be given hormonal birth control because they want it? Not necessarily.

I’m really on the fence about this. I am pro-giving teens birth control, but it is literally the parents responsibility to care and make decisions for their teenage children until they are 18. I mean, they get in legal trouble if their child isn’t attending school until they’re 18 but in your opinion, it’s out of the question that they continue to make medical decisions on their behalf?

Now, I know what you might be thinking, “don’t the negative effects of a pregnancy and subsequent parenthood outweigh the negative effects of birth control” and I would argue that it depends entirely on the teen. My mother had her first child at 16, and while abortion was never an option (Catholic family) she was given the choice on whether or not to be a parent. She decided to keep him and subsequently had 6 more children, only one with any complications and was an incredible mom and she loves it.
Disregarding the views of left of center youth voters hasn’t killed the Democrats yet, so why would it now? You can always just pander like Obama, or to a lesser extent Clinton, and not deliver, and it hasn’t diminished the Democrats’ long term prospects yet. They’ve even abandoned their long term base of support that allowed them to dominate the House for over half a century, the New Deal coalition (which was never incidentally the youth vote) and they’re still around. The Republicans are always going to be worse, so in a real sense the Democrats never have to do anything at all to appeal to the people who recognize them as the better party.
And yes, before the sea of downvotes comes in, the Democratic Party is still far better than the GOP on a host of issues. However, Democrats and Republicans are closer than should be the case when it comes to economic policy.

Student loan forgiveness was a good thing, guess we’ll have to wait for SCOTUS to see if it actually happens.

Not surprising. Neither major party does much for younger voters to earn their votes, and both are led by geriatrics with antiquated views.

This just shows that both Republican and Democratic parties suck and are not attracting new or younger voters. Their stance on popular issues are horrific, there is no reason to keep the status quo with its multitude of social issues.
I have no problem with Twitter as a source to get quotes from subjects — my problem is with Twitter as a source (especially the only source) for public opinion or reaction.
Ah, so it’s like an editorial instinct that you’re having a hard time suppressing. I get that. You’re wrong, in this case. Wildly, actually, as you’d be able to see through a very, very small amount of research. Like one google search small. So maybe don’t go into editing.

Have you ever been invited to the palace as a minority who has been repeatedly asked this question over your life — often by people who are only interested in parsing out how you don’t fit in and are different — only to hear the same question from a representative of the royal family? Maybe you have, and maybe your experience was different. You weren’t traumatized. She was. Wanting to understand how and why trauma can result from this type of interaction is totally valid. But “knowing” how we’d react to a certain situation isn’t enough to justify calling someone else a liar, which is sorta where we’re headed with this. For a bad analogy, consider someone having an allergic reaction — you might brush off a bee sting as no big deal; but others might literally die. Or someone who’s been badly beaten — one more hit could be lethal for them, whereas you’d be perfectly fine. Well for many people they’ve taken hits their whole lives and one hit like this, in such a setting? Of course that’s going to be traumatic.

So yes, this would be traumatizing, because the questions open deep existential wounds. Work in your empathy, people.
Someone needs to take these folk by the shoulders, shake them up a bit and look into their eyes then say "They want to fucking kill you. That's not a joke. It's not a metaphor. It's probably not gonna happen today, or tomorrow (though it might if you end up walking with the wrong group in the parking lot of a rally), but they literally want people like you to cease to exist. It's happened before. It can happen again. And, again, and I can't stress his enough: they want to fucking kill you. Not at first. First, you won't be able to get married, or adopt children, or you'll even have your children taken away from you. Then your businesses will be exploited by the government, no matter what happens to the businesses of cis straight white guys. Then you won't be able to use public transportation, and certain jobs will be closed to you. Then they'll make you wear a pink triangle when you're out in public. But eventually, maybe in a decade, maybe in two, if they get everything they want, they will fucking kill you. And nobody will stop them.".
It is. Boehner was a jackass, but at least he knew how to think, even if I disagreed with him. People around here don't even see him as much of a Republican anymore, which is bullshit.
Not quite but very close. Technically they are now what is called client state but they are (or were) bordering on being a puppet state. If Russia was as strong as they pretend to be then Belarus would be more like what the Warsaw Pack states were back during the height of the cold war; little more than a puppet that does what the Kremlin commands. Right now Putin's regime isn't actually powerful enough to force Belarus to join the war in Ukraine but everyone is still pretending that is real. We know this for the simple fact that Belarus has stayed out of the war despite Putin wanting them in it for more than a year. That is, if Belarus were actually a puppet state then they would have marched off to war by now but they haven't so what does that tell you?
It would take balls of steel for Lukashenko to give firearms to 1 million unarmed Belorussians… I’m not so sure Ukraine is the place they would storm….

The primary threat to Belarus and Lukashenko is Russia and its armed forces, many of which are already inside Belarus. If Belarus talks about defenses, it's to discourage Russia.

I don't think Lukashenko wants this war to exist. It makes everything worse for him. It now looks like they may be annexed by Russia if they are not careful and talking about a potential the big militia should probably be seen as a warning towards Putin.
Even better, the committee should remind House Republicans that how they choose to respond to the subpoenas sets precedent for how others will respond to theirs.
Do subpoenas have an expiry date? Because there's hilarious hypocrisy and hijinks that Democrats and Cheney could get up to with this. A very simple "I will honor your subpoena when you honor mine.".

. Based on my reading, Democrats control the committee calendars, and deadlocked committee votes on legislation and Executive Calendar items can make their way from subcommittee to committee, then up to Schumer or McConnell if the deadlock remains. Either of them can then schedule a full senate vote, which can then be tiebroken by VP.

Moving the Jan 6. investigation to the Senate would be ideal, but for that we need to hold Warnock's seat in Georgia.

Senate committees require a majority vote to subpoena. Right now, due to how power is shared with the 50-50 split, committees need at least one Republican vote for that.

Nope. Stuff on the committee level is down to whatever can be hashed out in the power sharing agreement. Right now, every Senate committee has equal numbers Republicans and Democrats. With one more vote, though, Democrats will be able to appoint a majority to each committee.
They want money - pure and simple. Of course, what they want is money from the west and if the west boycotts the Olympics, you can kiss most of that sponsorship and TV money goodbye.
I think everyone in the west should boycott the Olympics if they are going to turn into something like Sochi 2014 or Berlin 1936. Maybe the Olympics run by this IOC has reached the end of their welcome in the world.

oh I have never said anything about IOC. Only stating my point of view. I know very well every great Idea or Movement in the history of mankind to bring either people together or advancing Humanity can and will be hijacked and corrupted by a group of small people just to make themselves very rich and powerfull. Be it sport or political or Socialmovement. I dont trust any Organisation or Movement that has gain great influence over the world.

As a child I was told the olympic is for bring people together and to settle difference aside on the Sportfield instead of on the battlefield. So for me, its only natural, that anyone who choose the battlefield should be banned from the sportfield till they stop their war of aggression.

As a child i was more worried if i had found the best stick in the wood and if i could watch tv cartoon at sunday. But i get your point. I am, as an adult, not surprised but i am still disappointed. Though none of those 2 Aggression or act of war was an open invasion with the goal of annexing land, erasing culture and eradicating civil population like the russian is doing. So mind you, we are speaking of 2 complete different kind of evil. Its like comparing robbery to Genozids. Both are bad, but one is clearly worse than the other.
If the railways are really so vital to Americans' survival and the economy as a whole, the entire system should be nationalized restructured as a non-profit.

The article explains how the sick day issue is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all of the ways the railroads are completely fucked due to them slashing payrolls. This leads to insane and unsustainable staffing availability requirements and railroads not being able to meet existing regulatory requirements.

Then you’re just playing whack-a-mole as they try to make those profits up elsewhere by cutting wages and benefits, maintenance, capital improvements, etc. The for-profit model is inherently a bad way to run systems that need to operate regardless of whether or not they create a profit.
The dictionary translation of war is indeed 戦争 (sensou), which are two kanjis that mean battle and conflict respectively. If a Japanese person were to say "war has begun", she would say "戦争が始まる". However, each individual kanji does have a meaning and sometimes it is totemic of that word, and 戦 (pronounced ikusa when used alone) is one of those kanji. Composite words that is associated with war will often have 戦 as a part of its component kanji. For example, a tank is a 戦車 (sensha, lit. war car or battle car); strategy is 戦略 (senryaku, lit. war abbreviation); battle is 戦闘 (sentou, lit. war duel); a naval battle is 海戦 (kaisen, lit. sea war). A Japanese speaker would innately understand that when used alone, the kanji 戦 means war.
Contextually, in Chinese and in Japanese, 戦 would be understood, on its own, to mean war. If someone came up to me and asked in English, what does 戦 mean, the closest concept in English is war.

It is cherry-picking to say 戦 means battle: this is not how the language works. 戦/戰 is a contextual word: it attaches the context of war into whatever this word is attached to. 内戦, C. Neizhan/J. Naisen), meaning civil war, is the word nei/nai meaning inside, attached to 戦, which gives the whole "word" the context of war.

I wish to second this take. Translating 戦 as "war" is exactly how any native speaker would understand it to be.

戦争 can be thought of almost as the formal word to use for war. I do not think anyone would see "戦" though and think of battle, fight, or match as in a game. 戦 immediately brings war to mind, contextually.
Your right. It’s absolute crazy how they committed fraud and stole peoples funds by transferring it to their personal slush fund for their hedge fund to trade with.
There is hones crypto but there’s a massive amount of fraud commuted and enabled my the large funds. Btc has value as a scare, theft resistant, and inflation proof currency. Ethereum has a smart contract layer that functions as an effective way to have p2p coding. Arweave provides decentralized storage. There are real crypto currencies, it’s just 90-95% is either fraud or destined to fail because these large VC funds keep giving these well connected rich kids billions to monopolize the space, and it keeps failing.

Like yeah, Ofcourse there’s scams proliferating with crypto, it’s a new way to creat wealth so obviously there will be scammers. But wether you believe in the crypto technology or not you arguing in bad faith to say that crypto caused this. The scam tokens will fall just like pump and dump penny stocks when they don’t preform.
Hmmm looks like the russian economy is tanked even harder with the war and there is a high probability that this will end with the pike in putins ass up the way to his head. Sooo great job.
That's pretty much how it has always worked. Except substitute EU for the U.S. You think the sanctions on Iran and Iraq were supposed to be fair or something? The global financial system is a tool of U.S. politics. Always has been (since WWII anyway).

The Kremlin’s right about this, just not in the way they think. Zelensky’s already said the war ends when Ukraine recovers every inch of occupied territory, including Crimea, and Russia is made to pay reparations.

For once, Peskov the Kremlin mouthpiece is right, Zelensky will end the conflict when every last Russian soldier is killed or kicked out of every inch of Ukrainian sovereign territory. The reason the war in Ukraine “could be a lenhy process.” is because Russia will never win, only defeat and utter humiliation await Russia at the war's end.

Exactly, this ‘war’ has always been about Pootin trying to snuff out any competition from Ukraine, hence taking the Crimea and East Ukraine where all the resources are.

Most of the major technological breakthroughs of the past half century were from public funding. This includes most medical research (yet pharma companies keep the profits), GPS, the internet, telecommunications, space travel (SpaceX didn’t invent anything), etc. hell, the Covid vaccine was developed with mostly public and donated money. It’s a life saving treatment, it shouldn’t have been patented but the plans should have been given for free to all countries who could produce it. The IP can be copied for free anyways, why withhold free medical info from countries just because they’re poor?

When death is the punishment for peaceful actions, you're gonna get violence from the protesters and their supporters instead. What's the point of peacefully protesting when it has the same punishment as violent riots to overthrow a government.
Now that protesting is punishable by death sentence, protesting is now a fight to the death - thats as escalated as it gets.

If the financial disincentive to have kids wasn’t there at all I think you might see a bit of a bump in fertility.

However, I think it's impossible that we could comfortably afford a good retirement and a child. She wants three. I wouldn't feel comfortable. I came from a very poor home that had lots of death, financial burden and piss poor financial planning. It's awful to see how many low income families in the 18-25 year old range that desperately want, and have kids then can't afford them through no fault of their own. My mum doesn't seem to understand that no, a single mum can't raise two children by themselves on state benefits. It's unbelievably tight. Especially with the pressures of modern society.

It's funny. My partner (28) and I (29) differ so much on this. We earn probably £65k pre-tax together, pay about £420 a month in mortgage (up north where property prices are cheaper), have our energy bill fixed at a good rate so we pay about £65 a month etc.
Oh, but they do, and it also depends on the crime. Also, white people do not care if black people kill each other. Weirdly, white people will cite crime stats as if they do not commit any crime.
Unfortunately, black people have carried the stereotype of being more likely to commit a crime for quite some time.

Our system is already set up to over-criminalize black folks. Our society already treats all sorts of things poor people do as crimes in ways it doesn’t for the wealth. And race in the US is tightly correlated to wealth inequality. And black neighborhoods are already super over policed. And black suspects are already much more likely to be taken to trial than white suspects. And racist cops (aka most cops) are already more likely to stop and frisk black citizens just walking around. And they are more likely to pull over black drivers. Etc etc etc.

Trying to demand racial parity from them would be silly, because each individual police department is different. Let’s say black folks are the suspect in 11% of the crimes in Polk County. Would you require the Polk County PD to keep track of all their tweets and intentionally feature black mugshots in 11% of them?
It would be a lot better if those African nations were the ones exploiting their own resources and making a profit.
No bodies here even mention that it's up to African nations to choose what's best for themselves. Most Western audience here cries colonialism yet treats African nations like children with no agency of their own, just because they chose China. It's this exact Western colonial mentality that cause African countries to favor China.

Global capitalism from the West and China will still exploit the hell out of Africa regardless, but it will likely be less agregious.

Personally, i'm glad China is more involved in Africa, not because i want them to own it/exploit it (they will try), but because the west/IMF have given them horribly exploitative "deals" for decades. The West has to be more fair in our dealings now to prevent African countries from accepting the many objectively better deals currently offered by the Chinese government.
Biden literally plagiarized multiple times in his professional career and he’s been caught lying about his personal background multiple times. I have to ask myself. What does the Democrat bingo look like? It must look very similar to whatever card you’re playing.
Arguing magnitude of qualitative characteristic is pointless. We’re not talking about little white lies. We’re talking about direct deception intended to deceive voters.

While it’s good that you accept that Biden is a chronic liar, the next step is not bring up your favorite politician, Donald Trump, in every political argument. This must be the whataboutism that the left is always talking about.

Whataboutism or whataboutery (as in "what about…?") denotes in a pejorative sense a procedure in which a critical question or argument is not answered or discussed, but retorted with a critical counter-question which expresses a counter-accusation.
And then what? Pilots quit, and/or wildcat strike anyway, and the airlines do what? Make the C-suite execs try and fly the planes? You can't effectively scab the entirety of high-skill and high-experience jobs like "large passenger plane pilot.".
Yeah. When I worked in Holland for a while, I was floored with how much EU residents get. Even the lowly service and retail workers. I sent some guy home one day because he was being an ass, and my boss asked why. I told him, and he said, "No, don't do that, he still gets paid, even if he's not here." Top that with sick pay and vacation pay, and somehow, things still run fine and I guess it's profitable since companies stay in business.

I used to play Microsoft Flight Simulator back in the 80's. I could never figure it out, but I imagine a real plane is easier since it's not all vector graphics.

I imagine one day planes will fly themselves since it seems like a self-flying plane would be a lot easier to program than a self-driving car but until that day, two pilots.

Awhile back, I read a proposal to have pilots fly the planes remotely from the ground so that each pilot could fly multiple planes at the same time. That sounds like a way to completely suck the fun out of the job and destroy one of the reasons people probably want to be pilots in the first place.

Removing a pilot from the flight deck undermines that entire effort and will absolutely decrease safety purely for the sake of increasing profits (people that think ticket prices will go down are nuts). Thankfully for everyone, the FAA don't get down like that. Their primary purpose for existing is to keep aviation safe; and despite what the news networks say, they are very good at it.

That accident directly led to legislation in Europe requiring 2 people on the flight deck at all times. When a pilot needs to use the lav, a flight attendant comes onto the flight deck in the meantime.
It does but you’re fooling yourself if you think that’s meaningful or that anyone trying to save the children from the current slander should have to care. Sodomy laws weren’t used against straight couples and these wouldn’t be used against grandma stepping in as Santa at the church play either.
It will not come back to bite them. Get that through your head and do it fast. Laws are not like magical rules binding prosecutors to the exact wording and nothing else. They are tools of the state and will be used as the state desires to use them. Nobody is going to come after the cis woman in the Shakespeare play. They will come after the trans woman reading her poem about sunsets.

The definition of "drag" in that bill is so broad it includes trans people, and makes "performance" include basically just existing with people around.

Also, doesn't this break people's right to privacy? Now whenever a performance is performed anywhere, to prove someone isn't breaking the law, they would have to provide birth records to confirm what they were assigned at birth coincides with the characters gender that they are performing.

" Brought forward by Republican Rep. Jared Patterson, whose district includes the Dallas area, House Bill 643 seeks to include drag as sexually oriented material by redefining drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances or otherwise performs before an audience for entertainment.”.

Such as stage plays? If women ever perform a role that has a character who is a man and vice versa, that would be included too, yea?
Believe me I’m making comments like this to someone I know that’s in his circle. Telling him that trump is a winner and winners would run for President regardless of party. Unfortunately unlike trump, this guy is really smart and just laughs and tells me to go fuck my mom (he’s a gentleman). Lmao!
Yup, I’m all about saying that he won’t because he’s a coward. Only winners run on a third party. If he doesn’t it shows that he needs the Republicans party.

He's led some of the worst political losses in American political history for a party. I'm not sure that GOP can recover at this point with or without him to be honest, he has completely hollowed out or was left of that organization.

I would be amazed if they ever won a popular election again on the up and up, without some significant sea change happening.
This is the exact reason why the death penalty should always be reserved for the most heinous crimes, and perhaps not even for them. You never want to encourage a criminal to kill witnesses of minor crimes to reduce their chances of arrest and execution.
Agreed. Where I'm from people care more about saving money than getting their hate boners on. IIRC a life sentence is cheaper than the insane process of review and appeal and waiting that comes with a reliable system to rule out killing innocent people.

There is no possible system made by humans who are fallible that could have a 100% accuracy rate with respect to death penalty convictions. It’s not nearly as simple as you are making it sound or as you want it to be.

Except they are human, they are some of humanity’s worst but describing them as inhuman is just a subconscious means to justify killing them. And even when the death penalty has been extremely hard to grant, there have still been innocent people mistakenly put to death. It’s better to not risk killing even one innocent person.

The only thing that stops me from killing people every day is the risk of getting punished for it. And i'm just talking about, like, when someone neglects to use their blinker when changing lanes in front of me.
At some point claiming elections were "stolen" without offering any proof should be considered a criminal offense, as it is a direct attack on American Democracy.
Well yes, because their leaders and Right Wing media networks are constantly lying to them about the accuracy and legitimacy of our electoral systems.

I think the “our voters aren’t voting” line is just ANOTHER way for the Faux News crowd to claim that they SHOULD be winning. It’s easier than addressing the fact that they are out of touch with the voters, that they only win by gerrymandering, that they have only won a single popular presidential election in the past eight. It’s their ‘silent majority’ nonsense all over again.

I cannot speak for the entire country but here, in my slice of Wisconsin, the GOP are out to vote in numbers as high as I’ve ever seen.
100% agree - I’m just pointing out that limiting competition on price shows the prospective quality improvements of single payor systems in the US.
Just to be clear on the Maryland model, there’s still competition on the insurance side but the state set caps on pricing meaning there’s no cost side competition leading only to quality side differentiation which improved outcomes in the state. A single payor system would have the same effect.

Nationalized payors lead to competition on quality without the issues of fully nationalized healthcare.

A universal healthcare bill would have a significant economic consequence on the economy. Just as nationalizing the railroad would be or any other nationalization effort.

We have already nationalized the railroads with Amtrak, it is time to nationalize freight and all tracks so Amtrak can actually be a effective means of travel.
Sounds like it’s a hunting measure. In Missouri you can hunt on most public land and most kids start hunting fairly young (my ex wife shot her first deer at 7 or 8). It seems reasonable to affirm that minors can hunt on public land with a parent’s supervision.
The amendment would have required minors to be supervised if they were to carry firearms in public spaces.

And it's even worse than the headline suggests. They voted down an amendment that would require minors to only carry firearms in public spaces under adult supervision without a permit, safety training, or criminal-background check, a problem created by 2017 legislation that was vetoed by the governor and then forced through by a supermajority in the legislature.

In a turn of events that absolutely defies logic, the Republican-controlled Missouri House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to reject an amendment that would have banned minors from being allowed to openly carry guns on public land without adult supervision. Which, thanks to a 2017 law, they are currently free to do. (That law, which was vetoed by then governor Jay Nixon and overridden by the Missouri House, also allows Missouri residents to carry a concealed weapon without a permit, safety training, or criminal-background check. As S. Charles Wall, spokesman for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “under current state law, there is no minimum age to lawfully possess a firearm.”) To be clear: The proposal rejected this week was not seeking to ban minors from openly carrying weapons on public land, period, but simply from doing so without an adult supervising them. But apparently even that was too much for the state’s conservatives, who quite literally believe it’s fine for actual kids to walk down the street carrying guns. The proposal was defeated by 104-39, with just a single Republican voting in favor of the ban.

This is even more incomprehensible to people old enough to have seen the entirety of Trump’s career play out across tabloids. There was never a time in my life before 2016 when it was not absolutely clear to everyone that he was a sleazy bullshit artist who was always worth less than his bluster and had the tackiest low brow sense of opulence that always made him seem like a failed try-hard in the wealthy circles. Just a crappy obvious con artist that made belligerent life choices merely so he could get tabloid press, because real news outlets saw no value in following the life of this boring loud turnip.
And then a bunch of dipshits decided he was a flawless god? Like, seriously, Trump supporters are stone cold stupid. Like, I wouldn’t trust them with a spoon because they’d end up scooping their own eyeballs out. Dumb is simply not extensive enough of a word to describe how absolutely broke brain you have to be to hold these fawning thoughts about Trump.

Trump fucking warped America's brain. It's really weird and sad. The Trump family I have I refuse to talk politics with, but, I'm pretty good about navigating touchy subjects like fucking dinosaurs with these people (YEC, dinosaurs are the devil's work), so it wasn't hard, I don't see them that often, so who knows that they are thinking these days. Luckily, all of that family is weirdly attentive to medical advice, so I don't think many of them fell into anti-covid rhetoric as much. Obviously I didn't discuss it with them, COVID was a great excuse not to see them, especially because there's someone in all of those households who is significantly immunocompromised. I know they did take it seriously, at least for a while, because they were all very serious about quarantine. One of my cousins is a weird far right Orange County guy, but he has a terminal genetic disorder and is wheel chair bound. He's the only person I've seen bring up far right talking points, and, it's kinda like "I don't want to get into a screaming match with my cousin that has been stuck in a wheel chair his whole life..... I'm just going to let him keep on going".

As far as MDs in the area went, I'd say COVID was the final straw for most, though Trump wasn't super popular in the medical community as it was, despite it being such a hard right region. That didn't stop a few MDs I know from 'preaching' at church about how the vaccine wasn't necessary and just getting COVID would be the same thing. I know several of those doctors lost their license or are under review by the medical board. lol.

I saw COVID happen and it was a bit of a make or break for the medical community (I grew up in medicine, in a far right community). It was kind of humorous, as the medical community relied on so many LVN nurses who, are kinda dumb. Well, all these nurses and other medical workers (office staff, etc) became anti-vcxx for whatever reason, when there were vaccine mandates for employment in fucking healthcare they all decided to quit, I think they thought because nursing is in high demand that they would be able to find another job that didn't require it.... Because they are idiots.

Oh, I have a grandma in another part of the country, she's old and losing it a bit. Sweetest lady every, my whole life, but her doctors basically prescribed "cancel Fox News". She's in a very red state, surrounded by Trump people, so I think when Trump people say you've had enough Fox News it's pretty bad. She has great grandchildren that are black, gay, etc and loves them all. It's a very weird thing to see, because she really played the part of "nice, sweet grandma" in my life, my other grandma is cold and mean. She still is super nice and sweet, her brain is just scrambled on some topics. Very sad.
I had posted this elsewhere. They try to frame it as people don't want to work but where I live in one of the top 25 most populous cities in the US, people have been priced out of the area. A recent report showed there was not a single apartment in the city that a person making $15 an hour could qualify to rent (30% of income rule) and many places just pay minimum wage or even less for restaurant workers. It's hard to fill positions when the wages paid will not allow you to live in the area.
Pay people a living wage. That’s the only feasible solution to the labor shortage. Stop being a bunch of egotistical, money hoarding assholes and pay people enough to live on. You don’t need all that extra money and you can’t take it with you where you’re going after the big dirt nap so crack open your wallets and start shelling it out. It’s only going to get worse if you don’t.

They’re not really now, so this will only make things worse. Company makes billions and then get a tiny fine. The maximum penalty by federal law is $15,138 per kid. It’s laughable.

That is absolutely ridiculous! It's bad enough that so many adult workers are struggling to make ends meet, and now you want to take advantage of kids too? These companies already exploit their workers, this would just be an even bigger slap in the face. I know for a fact that there are plenty of college students and other adults who need these jobs, why not let them have it? NoToChildExploitation.
Which is of course vague enough and make believe enough that Russia can say those conditions have/haven't be met whenever they want.
They ought to try and take the few conditions Ukraine is willing to accept before they end up with no conditions left. The unrealistic idea in their heads that Russia will ever retain direct control over any portion of Ukraine proper, by force, needs to die.

Ukraine should be the only ones setting the terms, and I think that letting Russia hand on to its previous ill gotten gains even temporarily sends the wrong message.

Yes, but is also important for Ukraine to keep bringing up, it gives them something to concede to Russia, for example in exchange for captured UA citizens.

A lot of the posturing by Putin and his cronies that is intended for consumption outside of Russia is an attempt to make people give up on supporting Ukraine, either by trying to convince people that Ukrainian defeat is inevitable, or that Putin will punish those countries that support Ukraine.

Any punishments also harm Russia, in the same way that sanctions have inconvenienced those imposing the sanctions, but Russia is not nearly in as good a position to absorb these consequences, something that Putin hopes we overlook.
If he could start all over, it would be very easy: The Chinese pharma company Fosun invested very early in Biontech and signed deals with Biontech, similar to Pfizer, allowing them to sell it in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The US had no problem to act like Pfizer is an American vaccine. China could have called it Fosun and do the same. In Hong Kong Fosun actually sold the Fosun Biontech vaccine. But only in Hong Kong. It worked, of course. But not for the rest of China. Why?
Why does this matter though? China is running a no COVID policy. It's not like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines make you immune to the virus. If it was he probably would. Even if they accepted Western vaccines, it wouldn't change anything about the current situation in China.

Why is everyone up and down in this thread not having even read the article, China was never offered western vaccines - it's just some American dork claiming they never asked. Not to mention the line "some studies have shown Chinese vaccines aren't as effective as Western ones" what studies? What actual link? Here's a hint, near every study shows that pfizer/moderna/chinas vaccines all have similar efficacy rates after multiple doses which near all of china already has, so what's the point in suddenly paying through the nose for something that's just as effective?

Switching parties doesn’t really do much other than change the letter after her name on ballots. She could have stayed a Democrat and caucused with the Republicans, been removed from all her committee positions, or been cut from DNC donor lists and fundraising. McConnell could switch parties and become a Republican and not change any of his positions or views.
I believe that she negotiated with the GOP to switch as an independent that caucuses with the Republicans.

Their efforts would have been to win in Georgia though. Everything hinged on that. It was an insanely clever way to gain Senate control from the Democrats and make it a 49-51.

Warnock won and its no secret in Washinon that she was planning on switching to Independent. So, in efforts to keep her committee assignments, she had to keep her promise to be independent, but not caucas with the GOP.

I think she caususes with the Dems, but you know McConnell would give her whatever she wants in terms of committees to switch sides. Keeping a power sharing agreement in play would be huge for Republican obstruction.
They can’t even swear in the rest of the House, the Speaker does that. Until there’s a Speaker, there’s no house. This is the only vote they can take.
Only one minor correction: they need a majority of the votes by name. Voting “present” lowers that threshold because they haven’t voted for an actual person.

The problem is it’s challenging to pull nearly 200 people away from voting in line with party leadership for McCarthy, unless McCarthy himself steps aside. At the moment he looks unwilling to do so.

My opinion - we’re more likely to just see republicans fall in line and vote for McCarthy as he cuts more deals with the holdouts. But who knows! Anything could happen tonight 🤷‍♂️.

They are, kind of. The “other” candidates besides Jeffries and McCarthy have varied from each round.

McCarthy has the plurality on the most recent votes. Of course, he'd have to both be confident that the MAGA 20 that he flipped would stay with him and that the MAGA 20 that weren't flipped wouldn't vote Jefferies out of pure spite (giving Jefferies the majority).
The Republican party is basically bought by Putin and we all know that once they take the House and/or Senate the funding for Ukraine, and the weapons will stop and instead they will try to impeach Biden for it.
The Kremlin literally spent hundreds of Millions of US dollars funneled through the NRA directly to sitting GOP senators and house members. They literally flipped 180-degrees overnight after getting the Millions of dollars, in some cases on camera days later saying the exact opposite thing they had adamantly maintained prior to getting a talk with their benefactors. Then as soon as they heard what was required for their new funding, they start word-for-word repeating Russian propoganda talking points, quoting RT, and voting for everything Putin wants and against anything that would limit his reach in the world.

The GOP are bought and owned by Russia. They spent the 4th of July in Moscow getting facetime with their handlers, and more funding.

It's so well documented that even comedians have made montages of the events and outlined it very clearly showing a timeline of events that are found in the public record.

Yes, they're worried about literal Russian assets, who spent the 4th of July in Moscow getting their marching orders directly from the Kremlin, taking over the most powerful nation in the coalition to help them FIGHT the Russian invasion. The same people that blackmailed Ukraine by withholding foreign aid and weapons illegally for sleazy political posturing. Yes, Ukraine is worried. The WORLD is worried. The GOP is literally insane and would dismantle NATO and serve up Ukraine on a silver platter to a dying Putin.
My school loans are paid off but I’m all about student loan forgiveness. It’s not right to send young people into adulthood in crippling debt simply for getting educated.
Forgiveness isn’t even the right word it’s passing the buck onto responsible Americans who choose to not go to college or paid their debt.

If so, you should understand why someone who has already paid off their loans would like to be included in this forgiveness (issued a tax credit at least).

Yes, it would be better for the 1% to pay their fair share, but it's not necessary for student loan forgiveness to pay dividends in the economy.

You know the two programs are pretty close on price, granted the edge going to student loan forgiveness over a ten year span. Though farm subsidies doubled under Trump after his stupid trade war.

No one will take you seriously if you don't realize incentivising college educations will pay dividends toward the future of this country. We've shifted primarily to a service based economy and if we ever want to get our manufacturing sector to grow again we need educated people to design and create new technologies that can be made here.

They were included, they were just too dumb to realize. What are all of those college kids going to do with that new disposable income now, put it in a mattress? Fuck no, they're going to buy things they need and want. That money goes back into the economy where people who make, and provide those goods and services are taxed on everything they do and buy then the money goes back into the government.
He’s never had the support of a majority, and the same people who voted for him in 2016 did so because they didn’t actually know what kind of person he was, and there wasn’t an incumbent and Clinton had been demonized. Not saying anyone should underestimate trump, just that conditions are different.
Odds get better if trump can’t win the primary and tries for a 3rd party run, then splits the vote between the open fascists and “nice” fascists.

If trump is even allowed to run for a second campaign than it immediately becomes a referendum on wether America wants a fascist state or not. No question about it that point, that’s what we’d be voting for…and when you make it that basic I’m just not sure how much faith I have that we do the right thing. I’d say the 2024 election (if it involves trump) would be akin to the 1860 and 64’ elections. Those were referendums on slavery and the continuation of the civil war and essentially one issue focused. I’d rather avoid the whole dinner than have to sit at this table.

Not disagreeing. The difference is in that one has openly taken off their mask by attempting a coup/overturning election. I don’t doubt that desantis wouldn’t be bad, but he can still say he hasn’t pushed the full button openly. If that makes sense ?!?
From a military perspective the invasions were resounding, fast successes. Even in Iraq, which had an organized military, Baghdad fell in less than a month. The "nation building" part was the debacle that went on for years. Ukraine on the other hand is still fighting Russia on relatively equal terms almost a year in with no indication that that is going to change anytime soon.
This is great for everyone short term because we want ukraine to win the war swiftly but in the long term thebworld will have to deal with a Russian humanitarian crisis.

I still think Putin wanted all of Ukraine, Moldova as the cherry on top, and Russia simply couldn't mobilize enough force to reach Kyiv on the border faster because it seems Russian logistics was rustier than expected. That said, intelligent commentary about logistics is well above a layman like me.

I think Putin never seriously planned for the contingency that he wouldn't steamroll Ukraine in a few days. And potentially unpopular opinion, I think Putin was really close to winning.

To be fair, dictatorships have changed somewhat. Instead of your early 20th century chest of medals, inform on neighbors, and kill the opposition blunt clubs, modern dictators have controlled opposition and political processes that mimic democracy and subtle walled-garden media ecosystems that try to keep their people occupied with manufactured controversies and pervasive and repetitive messaging using paid volunteers, bots, and algorithmic manipulation. The modern dictator, instead of gulaging pro-democracy activists or bloggers spreading sunshine on corrupt dealings, sends friendly people to visit dissident's homes to ask them to stop spreading rumors and make them feel watched, has flexible laws and pocket judges so there is always a crime if needed, and uses organic looking rumor mills and patriotic volunteers who fill every conversation about Dissident X with "he shouldn't have been breaking the law. He doesn't seem so good. How can he afford to take so much time off of work? Sounds like he reads too much foreign propaganda. Is he paid by CIA?".

True. I've heard Putin hides most of his money with a network of oligarchs. He can easily siphon off government funds for his own use by handing out government contracts to loyal cronies. Which is how the guy responsible for catering at Kremlin events somehow ended up with enough money to form his own private army.

Which is already happening. Ukrainian forces are now not even 7 miles outside of Severodonetsk. If that falls or is even rendered useless as a major hub because of front line combat, effectively the entire Luhansk Oblast falls, and Russia becomes dependent on only a handful routes to keep the entire invasion force manned and equipped, something that becomes easy to prey upon.

The loss of Kherson is a symbolic loss for Russia, but the loss of Severodonetsk will be strategically a catastrophic loss, and very well may be what loses them the whole war.

Well the biggest part is the day Ukraine was part of NATO is the day Russia loses all interest in stepping foot anywhere near it militarily. They'll need to resort back to tearing it down from within via fake news and puppet politicians. But that will take a long time to work as the memory of what they've done won't fade quickly.
I'm hoping they only use excess electricity for hydrogen production, otherwise it's pretty dumb to go from solar to hygrogen then back to electricity for no reason. Very inefficient.
There's no bigger picture. It's basic math. I think you're either misunderstanding how a power plant works or a misunderstanding of efficiency in the conversion.

If the grid needs power right this second, it's inefficient to convert to hydrogen first then send that through a fuel cell. If the sun is shining, it's best to dump the power straight to the grid. If the grid is full at that moment, then dump the excess into hydrogen and store it for later use in the fuel cell.

Hydrogen should be the last resort to store energy, when any other system of storing energy can't receive more. In that case is better to store in hydrogen (even with it's huge inefficiency) than simply waste it.

Unless you use it to store excess energy you can't currently store in any other way, it's very wasteful.

Of course not, but we need some kind of energy storage when we want to archive 100% renewable. Also gas is used in chemical processes as well, not only for electricity production.

Eh. That also seems like a really convincing argument that established power structures and morality should be able to use intolerance to maintain their power and morality over the populace. As long as they cloak themselves in a veil of tolerance.
Also, for the folks unaware and all “war is terrible”: the russian war machine made the spectacularly sound decision to place live ammunitions right next to the bunker 😑.
Still no warm feelings for Russian soldiers, but let's be honest, they have half a dozen of possible ways of action, and _all_ of them are incredibly bad.

They're people and yes war leads humans to do truly despicable things and there are definitely many scumbags amongst the ranks of the Russian Army (Ukraine also has their share) but cheering on the deaths of soldiers is just weird.

You can have basic empathy towards Russian soldiers though and accept them as people and not just pawns of Putin cheering on their deaths like a game because they didn't just abandon their home and family.

EDIT: To the Russian propaganda trolls still spouting the "they're just innocent sons/fathers who don't have a choice": They can surrender. A lot of Russians have already surrendered. It went fine and they were used in a trade for people that the Russians kidnapped.
My dad is a big fan of the republicans, although not living in the US, and he once said to me he wants to execute all LGBTQ people. I think some people think like that. So they are probably happy about banning as much as possible in order to not see drag queens or anything LGBTQ related.
No not really we are living in Europe. It’s awful, yeah. He got brainwashed by all those Q-Anon, and republicans on Youtube etc. Everything he watches is like all the time some guys yelling and complaining about the west / democratic life.

It would be an annoyance but for the fact we elected a bunch of these distraught and unstable people. They are kooks. But they are kooks in positions of power. And that power is entrenched thanks to gerrymandering.

So they embrace a hardline. They spew hyperbole and draw hard lines in the sand. They hurl fire and brimstone and damn us all to hell. Guys like DeSantis tell them the colleges and universities are to blame. Let's try to burn those to the ground And it's the kindergarten teachers grooming our children with evil lessons of inclusion and acceptance. Burn public education to the ground.

The things that makes a person a Conservative, is first and foremost a hatred and fear of change. And their reaction to change, is to look backwards at the traditions and institutions which gave them comfort which they cling to ever more desperately. Of course it doesn't help that the media they consume shows them images of disagreeable societal change constantly. Outrage TV is their window on the world.
I guess it's moot anyway because if this bill passes, being an actual good thing, some joke of a federal court will find a way to take up the case with no standing and no cognizable complaint and nuke it anyway.

It's actually the other way around I think. The northern states prefer DST since it results in a bit more evening light in the winter (because the further north you go in winter, the less overall daylight there is).

I prefer DST because I’m up north and I don’t like 4:30PM sunsets but at this point idc. Just pick one and stick with it. I don’t understand why we change the clocks to adjust to work schedules, schools, etc. Why can’t we just adjust when work starts, schools open, etc.

I’d be okay if they slowly converted. Aka replace signs as they need to be replaced. I’m not about just changing it overnight. That would be insanely expensive to change every sign, law, etc in one going.
Because the billionaires have no real power. They exist entirely at the pleasure of Putin. They are useful to him, sure, but compared to the FSB, GRU, OMON, and all the other police state tools that Putin has, there is very little the oligarchs can do against Putin. They can't trust anyone - anyone they talk to or hire might easily be in the pocket of FSB. The best (even only) shot they'd have at killing Putin is by doing it personally, and given how paranoid Putin is, I'm not sure what you'd be able to kill him with if you even did get close to him.
It's an oligarchy ruled by the police state, not by the billionaires. The siloviki have the power, and that's just a fact. Look at what's already happened to the billionaires that stepped out line. I wouldn't even call them oligarchs any more, just billionaires, considering how limited their power is.

He pretty much centered all power around himself a while ago (which is a big part of how this debacle started in the first place), even the billionaires don't really have much sway in something like this.
In 1968, the Soviets began the invasion of Czechoslovakia by seizing the international airport in Prague and then using it to land airborne forces. Last year, the Russians tried similar moves outside of Kyiv, and now we hear rumors that maybe they’ve got plans along the same lines for Moldova.
Look at a map of Moldova and tell me how Russia is going to get there. How Russia would get any supplies or ammo there.

Exactly. I don't understand how people don't get this. Russia can't get to Moldova. They can't send supplies. I mean, at least the 7000 Moldovan troops can be resupplied with ammo. Russian forces there are effectively already encircled. Russia can't even fly fighter jets over Ukraine, let alone cargo planes.

Russia can't get to Moldova. There is no access to them. They can't get supplies, ammo, troops, or anything to the country. They'd either have to go through Ukraine or try to use ships. The problem is that any ships would also be within range of Ukrainian attack.

The whole thing is a distraction to try and draw some Ukrainian forces that way with the threat of another front. Russia could absolutely take Moldova if they took Ukraine. The problem with the whole thing is that Russia didn't take Ukraine and all paths to Moldova either go through unoccupied Ukraine or Romania, who is a member of NATO.

Moldova should be proactive in denying Russian access, but there's no real threat unless Russia can make gains into central and western Ukraine, which is (partially) why Ukraine retaking Kherson was vital.

At the time, Ukraine had been positioning some military units along the boarder with Moldova to defend against any possible act of Russian aggression. Russia had for a number of weeks been denying any military ambitions relating to Moldova.
it's just the price the rest of us have to pay for gun owners to keep up their hobby. Think about how frequent stories of these mass shootings are a shot in the arm to mom and pop gun stores.

Switzerland, I believe Serbia and Canada also have guns. Not to the level of the US of course, they're far ahead of everyone in that respect. However their gun deaths are through the roof proportionally, which means it's not just a gun issue.

I'll also add just so we're all on the same page, I'm not saying everyone should be armed with a gun. Some people don't like guns, or feel pepper spray, taser, etc is enough for them. I don't carry a firearm in public. But I do have legal means to defend myself when I leave the house.

To start, I think education should be free, this is not a defense of the system. But you might not realize, when we're talking about endowments, the donor can be veeeery specific regarding what the money is intended for and the university has to respect that. That leads to some areas being very well funded, other departments and initiatives have to fight to survive. And anyways, at the institutions you're talking about, generally people who would be getting a loan to go to, say, a state school or mid-tier university would get a free ride, would they not? People generally only pay tuition at Ivy League schools when they can afford it, from what I understand.
Of course, the more expensive colleges are also (ab)using adjuncts. I’m just saying community colleges are a less-bad option for a student, not a solution.

People also misunderstand the culture around Hijra and associate them with transgender people when culturally Hijra is an extremely poorly treated cast with some mild "accepted" rituals around charity and weddings. They're also not reflective of the situation with transgender individuals in the same country as they're pretty different in life goals, outcomes, and possibilities.

EU has literally zero jurisdiction when it comes to price controls in Croatia, there's no EU "economic ministry" either. There's ECB (european central bank), but neither them nor Croatian central bank can really do anything about shops gouging their customers. Both institutions done their job when it comes to the "big picture" of switching currencies, like agreeing on exchange rate, making sure there's enough physical cash in circulation, preparing banks for the switch, making sure prices are displayed in dual currencies (HRK and Euro in this case) etc...
That said, shit like this happened in pretty much all countries that switched to Euro to various extent though, in some countries it was worse than others.

This has nothing to do with Euro itself, it's just opportunistic businesses using the situation to rip people off.
Indeed. It is still an aggression against a NATO member, "accident" or deliberate, and it's unacceptable.
Goodness, even if it was russian's 1345th "miscalculation" in this war, i am in shock they had the audacity to strike a NATO member.

I didn’t think you meant genocide, but the idea that we can just go blow up Russia’s entire military without a nuclear level response is just odd to me.

Tbh, i don't know what Russia's intentions are anymore (but its turning into a "nation self destruction speedrun" due to their repeated mistakes during 10 months of war :v).

(1) Deliberate attack by Russia, (2) an accident by Russia , (3) or a false flag by Ukraine to get NATO involved? The most likely is (2), I don't see this bringing NATO into the mix though.

Russia could say it was a false flag by Ukraine. Sacrifice a few Polish lives to bring NATO into the mix and help destroy Russia. I personally don't think this is the case, most likely a f\\\ up by Russia. But the conspiracy theory that Ukraine is behind it - it's not completely inconceivable.
It is very much strategic and they have only to look at the Ukraine war to see why BRICS might be beneficial to them. China is promising them a financial system free from the interference of politics, where their money is safe and they don't have to worry about a privileged few using their control over the system to force you to do things their way.
India feels they can compete with China, but they can't compete with the US / West should we decide to cut off their access to international money because their population once again voted in a racist populist with authoritarian leanings.

I mean India and China are actual regional competitors, have gone to war in the past, have had multiple border spats sometimes deadly in the last couple years and both countries have developed or are developing vehicles to fight in high terrain so both countries at least do see a conflict as possible.

And can’t forget that the same Russian ideology that called for the invasion of Ukraine and other countries also calls for the break up of China.

Yeah, I mean Ukraine war notwithstanding I'm still horrified by how many high ranking russians are killed mafia-style by Kremlin (if I put mysefl in the shoes of a russian). That's just madness. It's 21st century and I expect something like this to be a thing of the past, at least in the democratic part of the world.
That’s the part people like you don’t understand, sooner or later you’ll be in charge and you will get blamed for every shithead in your generation.
Every night when I go to bed, I pray a prayer that I live long enough to see the next generation start blaming your generation for everything wrong.

But - without taking anything away from the issues younger generations face, I am honest about what the nation building discourse of the boomer gen looks like. And the difference between it and the examples you’ve given is that those examples don’t steer nations and policy. Boomers - through things like brexit, trump and the like, do.

Interestingly, both in western cultures and east European ones too. It’s them watching the propaganda on Russian state TV.
How is vat taxing businesses? You collect VAT from the consumer and every quarter you transfer it to the government. Businesses are even VAT-excempt for most of their purchases.
The idea in principle is that with or without VAT, the business would have charged about $X for their product.

Which is a very simplistic few of the whole thing. There are plenty of countries with so many import taxes, VAT, etc, that goods are very clearly overpriced and would not be so pricey without all of that, because of undercutting. The price stabilizes usually at a point that grants profit leading to a 'desirable' level of growth.

With a monopoly, or in sectors where a coordinated effort to stabilize the price at a profitable range is possible, then removing the taxes imo is useless. There is no point in removing taxes on transactions like cars, in my opinion.

But basic foods? There is no way to price fix that. The price you see is the lowest price possible at current conditions, usually. I think Spain is absolutely in the right of this line of thinking.
I know. I'm just clarifying a misconception that people have about Hispanic people. Some people think they're all mestizos which is not true. There are white people in those countries who even the nazis would consider Aryan, like white people of German descent who are all over Latin America. Latin America had the same waves of immigration from Europe as the US had.
The nazis also had slaves. They enslaved the Jews and other "undesirables" who were strong enough to work. Those who were not considered "useful" were murdered.

Yeah, too many people think Hispanic is a race, and it's not. Hispanic countries are just as diverse as the US and contain white people as well (and some of them happen to be nazis).

Like I’m Puerto Rican and I’m still white, even if not all of my ancestors were. But I also have cousins way darker than me who are more supportive of idiots like Fuentes. I mean, look at Kanye….

Which part of your comment or the one you’re responding to is factually wrong, though? High employment and raises will lead to more inflation. This is basically the Fed’s dual mandate.
Okay, you’re a company and you raise your prices 20%, purely out of greed. Oh shit, prices have gone up because of greed.

It’s defo a ‘goody people will be desperate to work for less and our profits will go up because we don’t have to pay those pesky wages’ short term thinking and then long term people stop spending and lose their houses and bank loans don’t get paid and the economy tanks. But then disaster capitalists buy it all up cheap.

When corporations are in trouble in stock market they fire a bunch of employees and to see a spike and not scare their investors. Yet they never cut ceo bonus’s or pay. They found a way to make money at the expense of people trying to work to survive and pay for their private yacht still.
Ok not crazy if you strictly limit your news and media consumption to one source only and willfully tune out the vast variety of extra data points and platforms debunking the Fox News lies. But sure its not crazy that a crazy person that only listens to one source completely beleives only that source that retracted their own lies.
You might argue it’s crazy to believe that all media but this one specific media outlet is lying, but that’s what manny people believe. More often than not, these people operate on faith — hence their religious disposition. They don’t need facts because they have faith.

This isn’t surprising because you want your delegates to be the most devoted individuals from your party. It just so happens that for Republicans, that also means your most crazy party members.

This was a republican, who got caught. The only thing this shows is that our election integrity is fine as is since we’re catching voter fraud when it does happen. The right fails to mention that most of the voter fraud have been republicans thinking they could get away with it since President Cheeto keeps saying it’s so rampant and easy to do to his base.

For the last 2 election cycles the vast majority of voter fraud has been small numbers of republican individuals thinking it’s easy to cheat because they hear so much about democrats cheating.
Are you forgetting his efforts in overthrowing the election? Just because Dan Quayle talked him out of Trump's last attempt, doesn't make him a patriot. If he wants to be a Patriot, he would have came forward with evidence after a coup attacked our Capitol and an attempt to hang him. But he still protects those people.
He was protecting himself, not the country when he did not go along with it. His cooperation now is the same thing. Self-preservation.

The fuck he did. He knew it crossed the line into criminality, that is why he did not go along. Treason can be punished by the death penalty. Had he gone along with this, he would have been arrested the same day. There would be no denying it was a banana republic style coup had he gone with it.

Pence is a piece of shit right wing radio host that wanted to hurt this country as much as possible, but his personal plans got fucked up by trump. At best he holds a grudge against trump, he isn't motivated to come clean to help america, only himself.

Trump doesn’t pay his bills, and he disrespects everything The US stands for. He disrespected Pence in every way and in the end dangerously so. Yet cry-bully Trump demands respect and loyalty. Trump is a Jack-ass. Hope Pence quietly buries him with the truth.
It would have helped if they vaccinated their population with some actual relevant vaccines during that time they were holding infections back, but they're so distrustful they'd rather use their outdated crappy sinovac vaccines that stopped being effective enough a long time ago.
I'm not going to tempt fate by suggesting that it's a different story now with the virus still in circulation in the rest of the world, and most people having been vaccinated and boosted.

Instead, I'll go way out on a limb and confidently predict that the State Department doesn't even update any of its travel restrictions for arrivals by air from China by the 8th. In hopes of spurring some action to prove me wrong. It definitely won't happen this week. Definitely not.

Yeah. It would take an uncomfortable amount of draconian policy to be set. But honestly it’s not only cutting off travel to and from China, but also any travelers who’s final destination, and originating location is China. And then not to mention all the other countries following suit.
⚡️ Russia is already launching fewer missiles at a time and increasing the intervals between attacks, — Andrii Yusov, the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine says.
He noted that the Russian Federation used "everything that can move" against Ukraine - launched "shaheds" and fired from S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems.

I just saw the recent videos of Ukrainian soldiers intercepting Russian cruise missiles with portable anti-air weapons. The missiles are moving so slowly. Are cruise missiles suppose to be that slow (hence "cruise") or is it just with those particular Russian missiles?

Most aircraft attacks are done by using jets and bombers as cruise missile launch platforms within russian borders.

The side benefit of the UAF drone strikes is that the Russian military has to go on high alert and hits their own munitions and vehicles. UAF does not have this problem.
I mean a big part of the problem is the supply constriction, giving people more money to spend may actually increase inflation instead of helping it since the supply issue remains. Usually the prescription is more restrictive monetary policy hence why the Fed keeps raising interest rates.
It's true that raising interest rates will eventually cool inflation, but it does it by putting a blanket, across the board price increase on EVERYTHING. It gets to the point that buyers have to refuse to pay a price because they literally don't have enough money to pay for it all. Interest rates cool inflation by amplifying the effects of poverty. It puts the burden of pulling inflation in on those most at risk.

The United States is not the only country dealing with inflation right now. And many countries, particularly ones in Europe are experiencing higher levels of inflation than the United States. While every economy is unique, they all continue to face similar challenges with labor sourcing and supply chain disruptions as a continued impact of the global pandemic.

As it takes time for more production to come online, in the near term, the tools our government has to dampen inflation is restrictive monetary policy - raising interest rates, raising taxes, and cutting government spending. This decelerates the economy by slowing the growth in the money supply resulting in less upward pressure on prices.

The chief factor of inflation today is supply bottlenecks. As demand continues to outpace supply, prices will continue to rise. As pressure on the global supply chain eases, prices will also ease and inflation will follow.

You cure inflation by reducing the money supply...They are increasing spending that will have no effect on reducing cost of living or consumer prices. If they had passed legislation to reduce property taxes on people who owned only a single property and income taxes on lower income residents while increasing taxes on people with multiple properties and high incomes they could increase money for social assistance programs that would contribute further to the economy than just simply providing money. Like food stamps.
Yes, but not the Senate. Republicans were expected to have a massive landslide of victories that never happened. The most important thing that happened was Trump MAGA candidates were beaten badly across the US that will very much damage Trump and his attempt to run for president and make it impossible for Trump to launch another coup attempt if he loses in 2024.
MAGA meltdown time. I remember seeing on Facebook all these red wave memes and Republicans being so smug and confident of landslide victories that will help launch Trump's campaign and comeback for 2024.

This is exactly why Republicans have been able gain power in recent elections. Republicans are known as to be reliable in every election. Do not become complacent with any election going forward. It shouldn’t take a SCOTUS decision to motivate you to do your civic duty. Your vote is your voice, and let it be heard.

I’m now of the mindset that I just vote. I view it as a civic duty no matter how blue my county/district/state are. I don’t want some assholes thinking they got a shot at messing with what we got going.
But no, the upper classes won’t have it. You see if the working classes had more time (freedom) they would have time to pursue passions, hobbies, and education. They would learn that the system they toil so hard to uphold isn’t to their benefit, it’s to their demise.
It’s an oversimplification of the point. France is part of the EU, and the EU has worker rights and protections that outpace the U.S., and yet remains an economic titan within the world. My point wasn’t that France is perfect, it’s that you don’t need to squeeze the life out of workers to do well financially.

By any and every metric France should be a shining beacon that we DONT need 9-5, 5 days a week or any other bs system imported from the industrial era for most jobs. People can get their work done, produce profits as the company needs, and be home in some cases working 1-2 hours of a working day.

Yeah the US is on another level bad. And the culture is worse too. I know how it is in France and Italy at least (where I've been), even if people aren't happy about economic prospects and shit, the people including young still "enjoy" life and try to make the most out of it. Meanwhile American youngsters go into full depressive doom mode as we see on Reddit and other English language media.

I'm not making fun of our American youngsters - I find this actually so saddening for us. Our culture makes this so much worse than it should, we put up with this bs yet feel powerless. I wish we were more like Italians but alas it takes a generation for any cultural change to even happen.

It shows that Obamas treaty was actually pretty good. It was ended a couple years ago and Iran still isn't really close to a bomb. They had to give away a lot of materials.
I think it was a pretty successful negotiation for the US considering the Americans main leverage was threatening to start a 3rd war in the region after the US had already lost its 2 previous major wars in the region.

Iran still wasn't going to get the bomb after 10 years like the other redditor said. Yes, some of the restrictions had time limits, but not the most important restrictions that would actually allow Iran to build a bomb.

Yes, and according to Netanyahu back in the 1990s, Iran was 2 to 3 years away from developing a nuclear weapon. So can we assume that like Iran's phantom nukes, an Israeli attack will never eventuate?

You think we would stay out of it if Israel starts dropping bombs? They’d be flying American jets dropping American bombs where American intelligence told them to drop them.

The bombs would be American, but you'd be surprised how many components of the F-16I, F-15I and F-35I are made in Israel. You'd be further surprised to learn that the IAF doesn't require American intelligence for almost all of its operations even beyond Israeli border conflicts (as evidenced by the so many strikes far away from home turf in the 20th century which were conducted thanks to Israeli intelligence alone).
That's because the only GOP policy is "do whatever is the opposite of the democrats and damn the consequences." It has been for a long time. Republicans would be all for single payer healthcare in a heartbeat if the Democratic parts suddenly was against it. If Democrats were smart, they would just set their policy to the opposite of whatever they actually wanted to do.
Eh, the XM5 and XM250 aren't deployed yet. They won't start getting their shipments until Q4 of next year. Even when they do, it will take time for it to become standard across all units. JSOC and active duty infantry will get them first, then combat arms, armor, and MPs will get them, then they will go out to the rest of active units, then the national guard will get them, then training units will get them, then the Marines will finally get them once there are gently used ones available for purchase. There are training battalions still training on the M16 even though the M4 has been standard issue for years. I guess we could send the thousands upon thousands of rifles sitting in warehouses to Ukraine, but the military still needs a lot of them while they wait for the new ones.

Sending 20 year old equipment for Ukrainians who then decimate Russian army, sounds like a great return on investment.

Not to mention, when people say that America is sending Ukraine 10 billion dollars' worth of equipment, in most cases (i.e. not Himars or Patriot) what they mean is America is sending equipment that cost 10 billion dollars back in the early 90s and was just gradually going obsolete in some supply base anyway.

A bunch of countries that were maintaining Soviet-era equipment that was simply too expensive to replace in peace time offloaded all that stuff and got a great deal on modern American kit. Poland and Czechia and Romania all got great deals on far better gear, AND it's for a good cause!
While other states like Michigan and Minnesota and Pennsylvania were sending Democrats to the US Senate and flipping state houses in favor of the Democrats, North Carolina got redder.
Extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression, and no citizen ballot initiatives (and a state legislature that will never give that power to the public) are making it pretty permanent in NC and a bunch of other states.

North Carolina has a gerrymandering problem which has made its way to the Supreme Court- the SC that has a Federalist Society favoring majority. This could put We the People's democracy on the chopping block, and if the SC rules in favor of ISL doctrine, states will be harder than ever before to 'flip' despite a majority of votes.

The state level judicial partisanship, particularly around gerrymandering, always seems to favor the GOP. NY for example. Voter turnout has never been more critical, and with Republican party legislative domination in states like NC, it is hard to imagine voters feeling their vote will make a difference.

Now, you could argue that being disheartened by gerrymandering has depressed turnout, but even when turnout was good, as it was in 2020, Dems still lose in North Carolina.

In 2022, turnout in NC by traditionally blue voters (Dems/independents, 18-40 year olds, and urban/suburban) statewide was low enough to give Republicans the advantage. Old North State Politics analyzed the 2022 turnout data and the graphs tell the story very clearly: .

Turnout in NC blue areas was low for 2022 compared to the other states you mentioned. The state isn't getting redder, people just didn't show up. There is a lot of speculation about why that is. Some people think it's because the upper ticket Democratic candidates were uninspiring. I think it might be a little bit of that, plus there was no direct threat to abortion in this election.
“And that was the third porn star I cheated on my wife with, right around the time that I tried eating long pig with my good friend Epstein. Did you know we had a suicide pact?”.
"It was the best suicide pact. Nobody has ever seen a suicide pact like this one. People would come up to me and say "Sir, your suicide pact is the best, most powerful suicide pact I've ever seen."".

Yep. Thats what pisses me off to no end. Time and time again its been proven Barr has used his biases to influence the DOJ in an unethical way.

I mean he wasn’t wrong because his cronies successfully brushed the investigation under the rug. So who here is stupid? Trump who continues to test the limits of his corruption or us (America) for not holding him accountable? Im honestly not sure anymore.

If you ignore Trump for a second, this is blatent corruption by Barr and Durham whom are both government officials.

But the media, including left wing media, allowed him to go redemption tour to re write his history making appearances on every media outlet after he resigned.
Yet this isn’t a purely materialistic or class concern. I feel that this movement in behalf of the poor is the most moral thing — it is saying that every man is an heir to a legacy of dignity and worth.
In bible, the rich man was punished because he passed beggar Lazarus every day and did not see him … and I tell you if this country does not see its poor — if it lets them remain in their poverty and misery — it will surely go to hell!".

Yes. It also helps children be able to eat daily, and that helps their education levels. Other countries feed their kids freely (and much more nutritionally), and their higher education scores are reflected in that. Republicans most certainly seem to always clamor for better test scores, and yet they don't care about doing anything to help kids improve in school. They actually delight in seeing kids do worse, in reality.

The Republicans want to literally starve their own people and make them more susceptible to illness?

Next in the IA GOP plan… extermination chambers for those yucky Americans who are a drag on IA society. You may think that’s hyperbolic… but if you look at the republicans antivax message and boarder policies, which created near concentration camp like facilities, we should acknowledge… it’s happening here already and stuff like this is a step towards concentration camps.
And I suspect its because Black people overwhelmingly break for Democrats. Where a white conservative person would typically vote for a Republican, the Black Conservative person may STILL vote Democrat due to the rampant racism apparent in the Republican party.
However, the black community will continue to support democrats for the time being, because the overwhelming consensus is that the brand of conservatism that is currently ruling the GOP is the main threat that has hurt them in the first place for decades.

Here is an alternate headline: Black Democrats overwhelmingly prove they’re willing to protect the rights of others, even when they admittedly don’t understand them.

Besides the other responses, something you're missing here is that being a party of civil rights means protecting vulnerable people even when it's not an overwhelmingly popular stance. The qualities of the party that make a huge majority of Black voters side with Democrats are the same qualities that make things like trans rights an important part of the party's platform.

Everyone has their own pet issue they think should be the center of attention. Even if it is popular on its own, it isn't always the best one to unite a diverse group of voters. But despite that, many Democratic candidates continue to support the idea of universal health care in one form or another.

A substantial number of Democrats and swing voters also don't agree with the idea of a single-payer health care system. It has probably shifted a little more in favor since this poll, but this is the one that came up when I searched.
I'm not sure where you're getting that idea from... The US openly admits to actively destabilising other countries and regions, it's not the global force for peace it is often portrayed as.
Historians attribute this to the creation of the European Union bringing stability to the contingent that seemed to kick off another global conflict every decade, not to the US.

The US was the biggest guarantor of European security and its likely NATO, not the EU, that most contributed to the long peace that we've had in Europe.

Except that the time between WW2 and the creation of the EU was 40 years which is longer than the gap between WW1 and WW2, so what do you attribute that safety to?

Because having the most peaceful decades in the human history was so bad and having the biggest war in Europe since WWII now is so good, amirite? Who needs that status quo, lol.
We'll see if Trump crazy town team goes down with the big civil lawsuits, including Fox and Newsmax.
Lawyers need to be sanctioned, and politicians should be liable both criminally and civilly for their actions. Lake may have violated some Arizona election laws with some of the information she put on social media.

If you choose to be dishonest and take a stance that there is no voter fraud, that is your choice. I choose to admit there are some instances of voter fraud, just not enough to sway much more than maybe a small town city council election.

Uh huh.... and voter fraud occurs so infrequently and so insignificantly that when there is a problem it becomes national news like what some GOP operatives did in North Carolina.

What this really does, other than divide our country, is make it really hard for people with VALID claims of voter fraud to be taken seriously, because they get lumped in with these alt-right morons.
Most Christians have either read a significant amount, or the entirety of, the bible. They probably have not done it straight through, but throughout all of the Sunday School classes, youth groups, and readings in church they have read pretty much all of it if they were raised in church. It is long, but it is not that long and sermons tend to repeat for lack of content over the years.
The problem is that when people accuse them of "not reading it" it is incorrect. They all do to some extent, or at least have, and so they see that as an unjustified attack on their character. It is much, much better to go with the truth: They do not understand what they are reading.

But I have seen people literally use a word in Greek, translate it to Hebrew, then look up all the uses of that translated Hebrew word spanning hundreds of years and try to force those connotations on the Greek term from another few hundred years later. It is linguistic abuse.).

This. They’ve been searching for that accountability ceiling for years and they have yet to find it. At this point I’m pretty sure it doesn’t exist. Which is really bad news for our future.

The bad thing is some made up scenario in their heads. It’s different for each one of them. Can be some anti vax nonsense or a Q-style conspiracy theory.
In theory, yes, but in practice I think IOC will fold here and exclude Russia and Belarus. And if France would join the protest they would almost certainly fold. FIFA folded and they are if anything even more corrupt than IOC. No matter how much Russia bribes a wide European boycott is likely to hurt IOC more than the missing Russian bribes.
I wish I was able to boycott this, but I've already been boycotting the Olympics since it became clear Russia would never face real consequences for systemic doping.

Not defending Russia but Norway has a lot of doping scandals aswell, which is sad because i thought our brothers and sisters in the west were better than that. Anyone doping should be banned.

Yes individuals should be banned for doping. But we are saying that all Russian athletes should be banned just due to the fact the Russian government forces their athletes to dope. Until Russia as a country can prove it won’t force their athletes to cheat, then no Russian should be allowed to compete.

The point is flying over your head. Russia as a country sponsored doping for all their athletes even forcing children to do it. Norway does not do that and can’t control their athletes doing illegal stuff.
this ALWAYS happens. Breaking news drops and you get really reasonable takes in there (looked at their top post about this and the top comment is how all news, Fox included, with shareholders, lies to the people. Many highly upvoted comments agreeing that Fox is BAD).
The only feasible outcome I can see from that sub is them ditching Fox but moving towards NewsMax or whatever the far, far right media is now.

Fox has always has their bug in the lower corner say “Fox News.” This implies that all of these “entertainment/ opinion shows are actually journalism driven. Only after lawsuits does Fox management claim “these shows are not news, and should never be used to form an opinion.”.

If there ever was a Defamation suit that could combat Fox News and its Editorial shows it might be Dominion's civil suit. From my not lawyer understanding Dominion has to show both intent and damages which is very difficult to do. However Dominion has texts and internal communications saying they did not agree in accusations of fraud and they have show damages, the number of canceled contracts by multiple states specifically commenting on potential fraud.

Final reason why Dominion could pull it off. They have the money and legal team to fight it. Fox will not be able simply tie the case up and extend it till Dominion runs out of money.
Funny how the men there can have uncovered heads and arms without the women going mad with lust for them. They must think that Muslim women have much more self control than Muslim men.
The thing about Islam is it's meant to control your thoughts, Like some 1984 shit. I still catch myself judging people or I'll think something bad is happening to me because of Allah's wrath. I've since become an agnostic though so I don't really think about God much. It's just hard getting the propaganda out of your head and forming your own thoughts, opinions, and beliefs.

Plenty of people run around with internalized beliefs they got from others (trully independent thinkers are as rare as it gets) whilst not trying to force those views on others.

Saying that it's "internalized misogyny" only provides an explanation for their beliefs but doesn't explain them wanting to forcefully impose said beliefs on others.

It doesn't matter if the beliefs of the female assholes who want to force their views on other people's bodies are internalized misoginy or not - those women have agency and are the ones CHOOSING to impose (or vote for those who would) those beliefs on others.
So what’s your solution? Simply tell the countries that contributed the least to climate change, will suffer the worst effects, and with the least capacity to mitigate resulting problems, to go collectively fuck themselves? This appears to be a popular attitude at the moment.
It’s a bandaid that everyone here seems to think is completely unjustified and shouldn’t be given to these countries in the first place, never mind the prospect of something more substantial offered for this bullet wound.

Oh yes? Do you need money to fund relief for worsening natural disasters in the global south exacerbated by climate change? Do you need funds to build out green energy and transport technology as a poor developing country trying to raise the standard of living for its people? Are you someone who’s contributed virtually nothing to emissions in terms of global averages but is set to receive some of the worst consequences of climate change?

We know from other reporting that they made no meaningful progress towards solving the root causes of climate change, so say that instead of framing it like a limited number of people's opinions on the matter.
Not saying CS is totally neutral as to whether they benefit from having these accounts/clients, or that management fees in $19 billion will be negligible. But this is just sort of a status quo thing.
It ain’t all or even mostly going to be cash. Other assets are harder to leverage. Precious metals might be impossible unless they are EFTs based in metals. Other assets could be actual tangibles, in addition to shares. Not all shares (especially in the private banking world) are the kind traded on public exchanges that lend themselves to loaning out, and even then the customer has to consent. This level of customer would not be pressured to consent. The relationship is too valuable.

I don’t doubt the bank can make use of the cash that’s in there. But that’s going to be a small fraction of the assets being frozen.

What happens when you "freeze assets"? Does this mean that Credit Suisse is now gleefully holding $19B dollars and is making investments and collecting interest on that money? When it "unfreezes" do they owe the depositors interest payments?
This is what's broken. This shouldn't be possible. The consequences for ignoring the court's ruling were not severe enough. Every one of those defiant members should have been held in contempt of court and thrown in jail until they followed the order of the court if that's what it took to get fair maps.
The difference was that in NY, the officials actually obeyed the court's decision. In Ohio, the redistricting committee just ignored the court and did what they wanted to anyway.

Right, but that only happened because the state GOP just ignored the state Supreme Court for so long that we had to use the old maps in order to have an election at all.

As a fellow Ohioan; I am beyond incensed by the state’s Republican lawmakers’ constant ignoring of the will of the majority and the rule of law. They are mirroring Florida and Texas and somehow are allowed to operate like a one party rule authoritarian country, like China. I can’t explain why the majority of Ohioans voted for Mike DeWine and Frank LaRose, two men who openly flaunt their authoritarian behaviors. I do know that more democrats should be in other elected positions but are not due to many years of gerrymandering. And now LaRose is attempting to squash the last avenue that the people have, to fight for our rights in the state. He wants to make the threshold for an amendment to pass, 60%. He fears the majority of Ohioans will vote for abortion rights and also an independent fair maps committee- measures that have been passed by the people in states like Kansas and Michigan respectively. If the GOP continues to get their way, we will continue to be ruled by an extremist group of individuals with Ohioans having little to no say in what decisions these people make that will severely impact our daily lives. I think Ohioans should be protesting in the streets in mass to educate the entire country about what is going on!
They are in violation of the UN Charter which they signed in 1991. It specifically requires ALL nations to never seize and annex territory by force of arms. First Crimea and now the Eastern Provinces of Ukraine, meanwhile bombing clearly civilian targets in Central and Western Ukraine. The UN General Assembly should expell Russia completely, not just from the Security Council, after all the USSR was one of the permanent members not Russia. Russia wasn't even a separate entity of the UN until 1991, whereas Ukraine SSR was a founding charter member of the UN and merely changed its name to Ukraine without the SSR moniker.
Actually in removal of Russia from the Security Council Russia doesn't get a veto vote in the UNSC. If Russia keeps threatening first use of Nuclear weapons, even tactical weapons, they will be removed from the UNSC.

Russia is clearly the external aggressor seizing territory and annexing it permanently from Ukraine which is clearly forbidden by the UN Charter.

The Russian Federation broke their most important treaty obligation when they invaded Ukraine in 2014 and subsequently annexed territory. They can’t claim the rights of the USSR if they abandoned the responsibilities of the USSR.
Paul Ryan is not running for anything, so he's in that legion of "brave" retired GOP politicians who once kissed Trump's ass but now criticize him. In fact, he's in that elite squadron of high profile GOP politicians who quit elected office rather than deal with Trump and the fucked up GOP antics anymore.
Are we supposed to forget that any evil Trump committed in office was not only allowed by Republicans but celebrated?

Even if you liked Trumps first run, you should understand that he shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the office in 2024, and I think that’s what Ryan is getting at here.

Jordan doesn't want the palestinians. These are the same palestinians that tried staging a coup in Jordan in the 1970's. Supposedly, when the idea came up before the Oslo agreement, of a confederation of some sort between the west bank and Jordan, Jordan's King Hussein was horrified at the idea, and couldn't understand how anyone would think he would agree to it., and made very clear why he totally rejects that as a solution).
Is this what Israeli residency/citizenship for palestinian looks like? Why would Israel ever consider giving citizenship to people that aspire to kill them?

Israel annexed East Jerusalem and offered citizenship to those who wanted it, and permanent residency to those who did not. Israel wouldn't -and shouldn't- renege on this. the citizens would be left under no government, and what are the others to do? Those with residence largely hold Jordanian passports, IIRC, but I don't see Jordan welcoming the influx of people.

So to really answer your question: because these are Israelis or Israeli residents, a majority born there, and some being horrible does not take that away from them.
Someone didn't read the article. Or the consistent public polling numbers for the last 30 years showing 70% of Americans support safe, legal access to abortion.
If you do your research you will see that 60% of America believes abortion should be legal in the first trimester and 83% when the mothers life is danger.

A logical national standard would be for insurance to cover legal abortion in the first trimester to ensure that those who desire them can promptly go to the doctor avoiding both health problems and the inherent complication of going beyond that point.

I don’t know if there were exceptions for birth defects, but if a doctor came to a decision and concluded that an abortion needs to be performed they would be able to perform an abortion regardless of how long it is.

- Prohibits doctors from performing abortions after 15 weeks gestation – when an unborn child can feel pain – except in situations involving rape, incest, or risks to the life and physical health of the mother. (Affects New York, Oregon, California, Minnesota, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut, Vermont, Hawaii - All Blue States).

The pro-choice people have never been about unlimited abortion. They have always been about doctors making the decision with the help of science and not politicians (or religious fundies).
Turkey claims a lot of things, it's just that they're mostly on their own with their claims. We could lose ourselves in topic of Kurdistan but what matters for this topic right here is that Turkey has no right to meddle with the people of Syria, the same as Russia has no right to meddle with the Ukrainian people. And letting Erdogan get through with one thing while (rightly) not letting Putin get through with the other is a double standard.
We already have been allowing Erdogan to wage his war against the Kurds for like what, 2 years now? We're still allowing him to murder Kurds. And before that we allowed him to in the Syrian war who then . Let's not pretend that NATO is not implicit in this when we conveniently turn a blind eye on turkish fascism.

I'm not talking about the PKK but the YPG. The assaults on them in Syria, on foreign soil, are definitely part of Erdogan's term. And as far as I know is Turkey the only country that considers YPG a terrorist organisation.

Also, take a closer look at the Kurdish protests in sweden or Finland next time. They wave pkk flags and Cary pictures of the leader.
Abandoning Ukraine does not mean the war ends. Russia is unable to control Ukraine. The Ukrainians have shown they will not surrender to Russian imperialism, so if we abandon Ukraine, it just means that the conflict will drag on into a guerrilla war. The only way the war ends is if Putin comes to his senses or if the Ukrainians win so decisively that Putin can't fight on anymore. So the best thing we can do to end the war is to hasten Ukrainian victory.
I'm sure Russia and everyone else is so concerned about saving Ukraine. Bless their little hearts. The only way to save it at this point is to finish this war that someone else started.

Besides, Ukraine has already lasted far longer than it should have. Why give up anything now, when they're winning more than Russia and anyone else thought at the start of this? Keep going, make it costly for Russia for as long as it takes. It's what's best for Ukraine, it's what's best for the U.S., and we can see right through this anonymous article's propaganda, Putin. I mean whoever, you are.
Due to their demographics, this is the last chance Russia has to maintain and/or expand their position of power. They won't have the manpower to do this shit in just a decade from now.
Their borders are so long, that they are impossible to defend, especially with their lack of infrastructure, but they also lack men to sufficiently protect. Most countries have natural borders helping them, such as mountains, big bodies of water etc. But that's not the case for Russia. What Russia fears more than anything, is NATO, and rightly so. If NATO went in, Russias only option quickly becomes nukes. NATO members see NATO as a deterrent/defensive alliance, but it's viewed the opposite in Russia.

Not really agreeing with your statement that NATO isn't actively doing anything and we are not near Ukraine. We are, and were doing a lot. AWACS aircraft fly near the border 24/7 and without our munitions and hardware being sent Ukraine wouldn't have lasted, i love that were helping but saying that were aren't actively involved just isn't true.
The US and allies should be supplying Ukraine with longer range munitions to delete every Russian piece of kit in Crimea.
Ukraine has already been hitting targets in Russia, just not with western long-range weapons. It's been drone attacks and sabotage.

But if we're going to be honest, if Ukraine was told "our continued support of you is contingent these ATACMS don't get used on Russian territory proper", they would quite likely follow that directive.

interesting if you think in an all out war between russia and ukraine it isn't a possibility ukraine run out of soldiers first.

That will force Russia hands to do an all out mobilization, and potentially NATO soldiers to be mobbed since Ukrainian bodies might run out.

You’re assuming a lot: that Russians will cooperate with a full mobilization. That Ukraine, a country of 43 million people, will somehow “run out of bodies.” That other countries won’t step up their responses long before that occurs. That if that somehow does occur, that NATO would then decide that that’s the time to put boots on the ground.
Modern day Germany is different than its predecessor, and they’ve made it clear internationally and themselves.
Because its true? Japan was incredibly brutal, to the point where some Nazi's said that they went to far, look up any Japanese warcrime and you would be shocked and appauled.

That’s not the case for the Japanese GOVERNMENT, who refuses to teach their students of their past and is extremely lenient on the topic of their involvement in World War Two and prior, to the point where they celebrate it. the Japanese government is full of descendants of the same officials who plotted the attacks of Pearl Harbor and the terror against Asian civilians.

The arrogant culture of the Japanese elites led to its aggressive attacks on the United States bringing the US into WWII. There is no reason to believe that Japan would not fall into the same trap a second time if it were to re-arm. The victims will be the citizens of Japan. It is up the US to defend the aggressor nations of WWII because allowing them to develop offensive capabilities is a recipe for disaster. Japan is still a fiercely proud culture and that is the heart of the problem.
No, the vast majority WANT the current state of affairs. Only a very small minority living in the cities were anti-taliban. People have to remember that Afghanistan was a stone age society 20 years ago. We cannot force idealogical change.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. If you watch some of the early 1900s interviews of women talking about the right to vote, a surprising number were anti-suffrage. An entire system of oppression cannot be maintained without participation from both genders. Maybe 50% of young women in Afghanistan are anti Taliban but women in general are probably not anti Taliban.

My idea is to arm, support, provide ongoing on base education to create a female resistance army in Afghanistan. The men can’t do it but I’ll wager a shiny bauble that if the women there find out there’s an army, they’ll do some changes.

It’s war against females. It’s sick and evil perpetuated largely by the men of Afghanistan, along with the area surrounding. Those who choose to fight against them are small in number.

And another thing, just because you fools supported an invasion of IRAQ over ‘weapons of mass destruction’, then kept supporting it (and re-elected the even bigger fool who called for it) doesn’t in anyway suggest there aren’t better people to wage a war against the Taliban and certainly I think an all female army would be far superior than what you guys mounted for 20 years, (which you couldn’t handle by yourselves to begin with: see rotation in from UK and Canadian forces to help you sorted lot out).
There is nothing that Russia exports that Canada does not produce for itself, except certain weapons that Canada does not make and buys from America and Europe.
And the American right wants to justify annexing Canada by force if necessary, and wants to help Russia dominate its region.

Also NATO would be bringing the war to Moscow's doorstep so there is no scenario where Russia could succeed in attacking Canada.

We have the capacity to ramp up our military exponentially we also have access to the world's most advanced weapons and would be supplied by all of our allies, Russia would be eaten alive if they even tried to attack us even if we only got material support.

If we were facing full scale invasion recruitment is quickly replaced with conscription, we would react just like Ukraine, full mobilisation and the economy would be turned into a war economy with all resources directed to the war.

The mass mobilisation of the population would be immediate, and the fact Russia would have to transport millions of troops thousands of KM just to attack any meaningful target they would be easy prey for our airforce while the country builds defences and trains troops.

So Russia would have to somehow land a force of what 10 million soldiers to have even a hope of capturing and holding anything, then they would have to somehow march over thousands of kilometers of tundra before they even came across a settlement of more than 2-300 people.
I admit, stripping of license is harsh for what they've done, but Latvia does not fuck around with russians, and for a good reason.
First of all - it's a law in Latvia. Broadcasters have to provide a translation of their material in latvian, period. It doesn't have to be the only language, but it has to be an option, which it wasn't.

Not going to lie, even before reading the text of the doc, I presumed, the Latvia govrmnt did an inquiry into the channel and found that Rain's activity helps Russian war effort more than it hurts.

If Latvia and the West would have them lose all credibility to the Russian people (especially those still within Russia) then what use would they be as an opposition news source?

I mean that's as good an option as any other really. We shouldn't have one 'leader' or even a small number of leaders to be honest, but we're not there yet as a species so while we're still too dumb collectively to rule ourselves and need a leader, why not have an 80 year old pisschad?

For anyone wondering why Switzerland has a say in any of this, it seems that Spain originally purchased these Swiss-made arms - and part of that agreement requires permission prior to being on-sold or donated.
A law that makes sense from a distance, given that no nation would want to see their arms land in the hands of an enemy nation through a 3rd party.. but in this case, the Swiss Gov’t needs to take a break from shielding Russian oligarch funds, pull their finger out from where the Sun don’t shine and get out of the way of other nations trying to help an ally currently under attack.

Switzerland’s neutrality made sense as a self defence mechanism in the early-mid 20th century but now that it’s nestled safely in the middle of the EU it’s not only selfish, it’s immoral.

Reminder that Swiss martial neutrality was because Swiss mercenaries were effective enough that they were being bought up by both sides in wars, so the neutrality was put in place to protect them from killing themselves.

Switzerland has spent its entire history of neutrality playing each side to ensure that neither side thinks the Swiss are taking sides while also profiting from whatever crisis is happening. If they were to send something to Ukraine, then they’d have to send something to Russia too (which they obviously don’t want to do). That’s how neutrality works. If the Russians were the ones being unjustly invaded, they wouldn’t help them either.

Switzerland could abandon its neutrality but they have no reason to. Their country has been built on the idea of neutrality and their entire military and economy revolve around their neutrality. And I doubt the Swiss people would be in favour of it.
181 MRAPs is pretty huge. The 190 heavy machine guns with thermal will help a lot with the mass troops rushing forward attacks that Russia has been doing.
If Russia is gearing up for another offensive with 100k+ soldiers, they must be storing huge amounts of food/MREs in warehouses somewhere near the border. Russia may not consider these warehouses as high value targets for the Ukrainians and aren't protecting them with any air defense. I wonder if Ukraine could destroy these with drones.

Seems likely they can/will come up with a counter-drone that shoots down other drones. Now, if they decide to make it look like a warbird of yesteryear… I vote for a P-38 Lightning. Classic!

Awesome! I’m a truck driver. I bet that Ukrainian truck drivers are seriously busting their asses right now. Truck drivers get taken for granted a lot, so I just wanted to look out for them a little.

I hope that Ukraine is being supplied with plenty of heavy-haul low-boy trailers and semi-tractors to go with all of these tracked vehicles that are on the way. Something to consider for all of those countries that want to help but don’t really have spare heavy-weapons, perhaps. Ukraine is a big country, and being able to move the heavy stuff around quickly will be a big help.
Don’t forget the years of negotiations the State Department invested in trying to bring Whelan home prior to this swap.
Whelan’s own brother is on record saying the following: "make the deal that was possible, rather than waiting for one that wasn’t going to happen.".

More than that... If Griner is to stand tall for a CBD vape pen, Whelan literally had Russian sensitive information on a flash drive, and admitted to it, and then blamed the wedding party he was attending.

Good question. His explanations for having it seem adhoc to me, but I can also see it being shenanigans considering how many of our former military love to do dumb shit in other countries.

I think Whelan should be home, but if consistency is a thing I would say that he deserves exactly what the hardliners say Griner deserves. Also, Griner never intentionally defrauded US service members while Whelan did. He isn't a Marine. He is a dishonorably discharged former Marine.

He got demoted, and kicked out for stealing from both the Marine Corps and fellow Marines, and even his family agrees with decisions that have been made.

Yep, and you have to take into account that Marines are assholes by nature. It’s a requirement and it is screened for at MEPS. So to be discharged on bad conduct means you have to be a whole other level of asshole. Not the usual “ha, this asshole is hilarious. I should buy him a drink,” but “holy shit what is wrong with this asshole?”.
not really. the use of nukes wouldn't be to win a war. it will be to make sure the enemy loses. I'm sure if your nukes wipes out 98+% of the enemy civilian population, the enemy military will probably start questioning whether it was worth the fight.
but nukes almost guarantee you're going to also kill your targets (see: a hypothetical scenario where you need to kill everyone in your enemy's country, or try) unlike gravity bombs or conventional warheads.

so it's better from a logistical perspective to use small medium range nukes along with gliders and the like than risk failing by having your planes fail to deliver your bombs.
The Jan 6th prisoners aren’t talking because they’re in isolation. Reps have talked about it on the House floor numerous times. Look it up.
When PayPal and Youtube shut down accounts they kept the money in those accounts. You can look that up.

Look around, it’s happening here. We have people who have been held in prison since January 6th without being charged with a crime or allowed legal counsel. We’ve also had people locked out and funds taken from their accounts because they questioned the vaccines or elections. Russia doesn’t have a Constitution or a Bill of Rights like the US, and yet the government here treats some of its citizens like second class citizens.

For some reason this article doesn’t mention that this new law only applies to those who acquired russian citizenship, not to those who got it from birth. This is against the russian constitution which putin has never read anyway, but it will only affect a few people here and there with two or more citizenships who oppose putin from abroad. It’s definitely not gonna make people stateless, let alone save anyone from being drafted.
Not to mention the issue of Ukrainian civilians, including numerous children, kidnapped to Russia and scattered. Getting the land back won’t bring them back, and I don’t think Ukraine is going to tolerate throwing them under the bus for Crimea.
Or maybe the vast majority of Ukraine citizens don’t want to negotiate and want to take back their land and get security guarantees from Europe and the US so they don’t need to do this again in 5-10 years.

Annexed Ukrainian territories must be returned back to Ukraine including Crimea, Donbas, Luhansk, Donetsk and KRASNODAR, yes Krasnodar region was part of Ukraine before USSR. Look up maps of Ukraine year of 1919.

Russia would have to keep Crimea. I don’t see Putin surviving if Russia has to give this up, and putting a man with thousands of nukes in a nothing to lose situation would be risky.
Something we talked about in my climate change & sustainability course today is thermal expansion playing just as much a role as ice melt when it comes to sea level rise.
The Greenland ice sheet, one of the coldest and most remote regions of the world that serves a pivotal role in the Earth's climate, is now clearly feeling significant effects of climate change. Researchers found that central and northern areas of the sheet have recently seen the hottest temperatures in a millennium.

It has been long clear that many parts of Greenland are warming, but the latest research, published in Nature on Wednesday, took a deeper look at the central part of Greenland's ice sheet, where the impact of climate change has long been unclear.
To learn more about that impact, researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research drilled ice cores to create a "high-quality reconstruction" of temperatures in central and north Greenland from 1,000 AD to 2011. With that data, it became clear: Not even some of the coldest, most remote and highly-elevated areas of the world can escape the impacts of global warming.

Aside from complications in determining climate from the deepest cores, it's important to keep in mind that while man made global warming is real, the era of humans has occurred in an interglacial period that's been relatively colder than in the past. The last "hot house" period happened before humans existed (several million years ago) and saw a consistent decline in temperatures until the current day where they are suddenly and rapidly increasing. Due to this man made increase, it's unlikely that humans will ever see another ice age again.

We are technically still well inside an ice age. It's been going for 2.6 million years or so. That ice age is why there's still so much ice. While it is warmer inter-glacial period, all the ice means ice age. In terms of geological timescales, the amount of time ice covering continents and poles is roughly around zero.
It's time for NATO to carry out offensive cyberattacks against Russia. Russia has been cyber-attacking NATO countries for years and NATO does nothing. It's time to deter those assholes. Shut down Russia's power grid or something.
Look at what attacks on the Ukrainian power grid do for the resolve of their citizens. The reverse is also possible.

The US has some very good intelligence sources on Russia. It's safe to assume shutting off the power to Moscow would also hurt the ability of the US to collect intelligence. This could be very vital intelligence in terms of something like Russia's willingness to use nukes. On the subject of nukes we don't know what cyber or other electronic warfare capabilities exist to prevent them from being launched in the first place, or reaching their intended target after launching.
\1 Make cops carry insurance against any lawsuits similar to how doctors have malpractice insurance.

I once spoke to a guy who had been a department head for one of Murdoch's papers here in the UK. On the launch day all department heads were called into Murdoch's office and he told them "Gentlemen, I am here to sell papers. Now get out there and sell papers.".
Right. They just want to get a judgement which affirms the security of their systems, and which would discourage media outlets from slandering them in the future. Once they get that, they'll likely settle for a greatly reduced amount.

So there won't be any bankruptcy or spinoff necessary. A win for dominion would hurt the Murdochs in the pocketbook, but they'll still be billionaires when the dust clears. And Fox News will still be churning out misinformation, thought they might be a bit more careful when they attack large corporations in the future.

The only thing that would be a death blow for Fox News would be creating and enforcing standards and regulations on reporting. If they can’t spew propaganda and vitriol 24/7, the cult will change the channel and they will go under.

Oh dear, no I’m trying to get the extremist authoritarians out of power I find it interesting that some people think that advocating for standards and regulations that require truth in journalism is “extremist authoritarianism,” though. It must be so unbearably hard living life constantly being so oppressed by that extreme authoritarian, the truth.
There's a lot of regional rivalry in the area, but both nations are culturally conflict adverse- even their skirmishes in Aksai Chin have a "no firearms" rule, so when things get heated they beat each other up physically/ throw rocks at each other. The only times guns were used were as warning shots in 2020 in over 50 years (both sides claiming the other side started first, what most likely happened is one side mistook the other side as firing a shot).
But you're right- all of the 1900's China was getting wrecked from wars and unrest, and that made them very reluctant to engage in further conflict.

Nuking Ukraine makes all of that far far worse and would force a NATO response and would cause further NATO enlargement, something China wants to avoid as it could lead to war with the West, which could in turn lead to M.A.D.

It was signed after Soviet ended, Ukraine give up nuclear power and delivered all nuclear weapons to Russia. In 2013 when Xi first takes lead in China he promised to Ukraine again. The agreement clearly mentioned Ukrainian have their right to choose their life, leader, socialist or capitalist, friendship with whatever west or east, as long as Ukraine doesn’t invade another country China will keep it’s words to secure Ukraine safe from nuke.
These protests are going to have to change power on their own and lots of Iranian people are probably going to lose their lives going against their corrupt and backwards government. I don't want to see another Arab spring intervention which cripples Iran as a country and drives it into civil war, I just want to see their damn regime replaced and 50% of their population finally be seen as equals.
I think anyone brave, honourable and intelligent in Russia has already been killed, locked up or has fled the country to look for a future life where you aren't under a corrupt and brutal dictatorship.

Also, last I checked, Russia's overall standard of living is a bit higher than Iran's, which is definitely a factor in both why so many Russians are apathetic and why they aren't exactly rushing in to die for Putin and his yachts, palaces and oligarchs. They have to be forced to do it instead. Apathy, not support, is the dominant feeling in Russia.

A lot of the Western misconceptions about Russia like the one you mentioned are exactly what fuel Putin's murderous and illegitimate regime.

He said in the following years (after the interview to Ekho Moskva, but before this latest expanded war) that a new democratic Russia would try to resolve the question in a legitimate way.
Adding some additional rules like a 75 vote confirmation requirement and rules like "the Garland rule" which is a time limit on the Senate for voting on a nominee. If the nominee isn't voted on by the full senate within 3 months of being nominated he is automatically approved. Another necessary rule is the 2 strikes rule. If two nominees get shot down by the senate, then a randomly selected judge from the next lower court in the same party as the president is automatically promoted.
Edit: But I see the hole here. Yes, it should be amended to not allowing an automatic approval if the governing party of the Senate is the same as the president.

The only remedy is Impeachment/Removal, which is a political process, and only has a chance of happening if there is strong public support for it.

Also, along that vein, the maximum punishment allowable for an impeachment is removal from office. Maybe the two taken together merely give the impression that Congress can only impeach in response to a crime, without that impression being factually true.

…which seems to say people in office who commit crimes must be removed from office if impeached, but does not say explicitly that impeachment can only be incurred in response to a crime.

It's also worth noting that two Justices faced impeachment: one in 1965 who resigned before impeachment proceedings could begin (for working as a paid consultant to someone accused of committing a crime), and one who was impeached by the House (and acquitted by the Senate) for political bias on the bench.

Look up the history of impeachment in the US, once upon a time even being suspect of impartiality (like being hyper-partisan) was considered a disqualifier - they never would've been nominated much less needed to be removed. Now the only judges republicans have nominated going back even before to Reagan are federalist society hacks.
The reason Trump avoided culpability during the Mueller probe is wholly due to the presidential powers he wielded at the time and Bill Barr's obstruction on his behalf.
That’s because Trump relied heavily on the powers of the presidency to stymie former Special Counsel Bob Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, using every advantage of incumbency to thwart Mueller’s team of prosecutors and downplay their findings. Citizen Trump will have far fewer tools at his disposal to avoid criminal charges.

Former President Donald Trump already faced down one hard-driving special counsel investigation without catching a criminal charge.

But his best moves from that tumultuous episode in U.S. history won’t work against new Special Counsel Jack Smith.

Smith will lead investigations into the removal of highly-sensitive government documents taken to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, and also into Trump’s attempts to reverse his defeat in the 2020 election and the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.
I agree entirely that policy changes are the key to successful improvements. However, I don't see how that gives a pass to people for electing officials who implement bad policy that scales emissions PER CAPITA because.. well, there are not as many of us as those guys over there who have a less dirty set of policies. I guess it's fine for small countries to just burn oil for fun because well they're small so their emissions are not as high in absolute terms? Do you applaud the UAE for their much better environmental record than the US? I don't - because their emissions are stupidly high for such a tiny country. Having a small population doesn't suddenly make it OK.
As for your incredulity at trebling the population and keeping emissions the same... This was your suggestion not mine. I simply pointed out that those people came from somewhere, so the places they came from will have decreased emissions, thus an overall gain.

Also, if you treble the poulation of the US and keep emissions the same, you will have decreased worldwide emissions - because those people came from somewhere.

If per capita was in any way a good measure, we could just triple the US's population, keep the same emission, and everything would be fine, right? The environment would be better off?

More people means decreased emissions? Do you think that pregnant women absorb CO2 from the atmosphere or something?
I feel like the portion of the video with him searching for a place to hide needs to be set to Yakety Sax, but I'm glad he was smart enough to communicate his willingness to surrender and for Ukraine to guide him via drone so they could accept it.
Well, Russia might have poisoned Belarus’s Minister of Foreign Affairs since he wasn’t 100% Putin’s man at the meeting, so I’m sure all of the other CSTO members will be happy to attend the next meeting.

It's always important to remember who the enemy is. You might need to kill the soldier in front of you in order to survive, but he might not be the ultimately responsible enemy. Putin and the Kremlin oligarchs are the ultimate enemies. A schmuck like this guy was just a pawn. There is absolutely a large scummy part of the Russian army that needs to be punished for their crimes but a new grunt like him hasn't done anything yet. Every story like this will encourage others to surrender, even with the threat of getting shot by your own unit, making it harder for Russia to fight.

Whatever they have been told they still support killing millions in a country that has never attacked russia.

Russian forces repelled a vicious saboteur attack in the homeland but it did not come without a heavy cost. Russian defense forces lost ten soldiers in the battle before defeating the three terrorists armed with advanced western airsoft guns.

⚡ General Staff: There is a large number of losses in Russian units operating in the Lugansk region.
Granted it's only the word of one politic analyst, but the mere fact this can be said out loud in Russia is deeply unsettling imo, nuclear weapon or not.
I said months ago, that the propability, that a substantial amount of nuclear weapons in Russias control are duds is higher than the propability that a lot of putins complexes stem from the fact that he is a absolute manlet.

Until last year the US inspected their warheads as did russia inspect ours it was a treaty, they absolutely have working nukes, this joke that russias nukes dont work needs to die,do the have the 5,000 nukes they proclaim, most likely not but they have enough to still ensure mutual destruction.

Edit; I know Russia has nuclear weapons but are we really sure they're in any condition to actually work? I mean it seems like Pooptin let the oligarchs and his cronies use military funding for nothing but their own greed.

I fucking called this months back and people downvoted me and gave me shit. Maybe it's too early for a full victory lap but screw the reddit hivemind I'll take it.

My previous comment from 169 days ago; Russia has shown that anyone alive from or in Ukraine is a 'valid' target, gun or no gun. The only good thing to come out of this is to show the world they need not fear Russia like it's a superpower. Not anymore.
I invite them to try alllll they want. It will be funny to see iran begging for mercy when Israel starts shredding their entire nation, town by town, extremist by extremist.
Fada also urged the destruction of the Jewish state, calling it "the child-murdering regime [of] Israel.".

you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims. the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa. the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%). it IS mostly anti semitism. to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above. furthermore. it is an offensive. stupid. strawman. trope. that i cant tell the difference. as a jew. when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.
Peruvian here, for those to understand the sheer stupidity of his coup, he did it without support of the armed forces, by not talking with key supporters, and in the middle of the day, while congress was in session.
The fujimori I was talking about is Alberto Fujimori, expresident of Peru from 1990 to 2000, who did a self coup in 1992 doing something similar as to what Castillo tried to do, but better and more organized.

The Peruvian congress is controlled by right wing loyalists of the previous dictator Fujimori, and they have been trying to impeach Castillo since the day he won.

The parties in the congress who impeached Castillo are supporters of the previous dictator Fujimori and his family, and Castillo has been a target for impeachment (which in Peru doesn't require cause) since he won the election.

The fact that we supported Castillo's impeachment do not change the fact that congress is absolutely fucked, which is why I assume changes in approval will be very limited even after the successful impeachment.

Yeah, the CIA convinced him to dissolve the congress, and then somehow had the ability and resources to get virtually the entire peruvian congress to vote to impeach.

this dictatorial power-grab gave the peruvian government all the reason it or anyone should ever need to exercize its impeachment powers. as apparently he's a wackjob populist wannabe dictator.
