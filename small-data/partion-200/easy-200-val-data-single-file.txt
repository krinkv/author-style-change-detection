My point still stands - with all their democracy and freedoms americans were unable to prevent the invasion. Moreover, some Americans even supported the invasion. But no one called them fascists at that time, because everyone knew that it's the government to blame and its lies and propaganda. What's the difference now? Are you implying that we, russians, as a nation are somewhat bad or inferior? Who is a fascist here?
These are obviously not laws passed in the interest of "protecting our children", given their callous disregard for life both at home and basically anywhere Russia conducts its foreign policies and "special military operations". It can only be concluded, along with those distracting and dividing with their culture war legislation against the LGBTQ+ community everywhere, that they are just projecting, are hugely insecure in their own sexuality, disproportionately pedophiles themselves, and afraid of allowing that light of justice and truth shine on themselves lest it disturb the shit out of everyone.

Not sure what else you drew from that. I could go more into detail if you're confused but I'm not here to type you an essay on the matter...

I agree. Distinguishing between ideology and application muddies the waters a little, as with any other political philosophy. But yeah, right wing anarchists and right wing libertarians should, at their logical conclusion allow for anyone to marry, and you could argue abolish the institution as a whole. I imagine a pure anarcho capitalist would probably support the dissolution of the state, and therefore marriage, but idk if any of them have genuinely thought that far ahead.

Anarcho capitalists are nut jobs but their philosophy would probably support same sex marriage. They’re essentially libertarians that are even more anarchist in nature, because as noted libertarians don’t actually believe in libertarianism, they are just disgraced tea partiers.

LG: Gay? I wish! If I were gay, there'd be no problem. No, what I have is a romantic abnormality, one so unbelievable that it must be hidden from the public at all costs.

"Congress has no right to my testimony," he responded. "We have a separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States. And I believe it would establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House.".
I remember him more for his mishandling of the HIV problem, and his religious-freedom-to-discriminate law that cost the state billions due to everyone else boycotting Indiana, I guess I had bought into the "humble background" myth he's created around himself, didn't realize his family had owned around 100 gas stations.

You are the product. Keep thinking about that until you understand it. This is not a dig, you are probably cool and all but when you get that it changes everything. True here as well but in a more benign sense. On twiitter and facebook it is malignant.

For what, doing his job? A job so blatantly straightforward, in a situation that Dan Quayle was the voice of reason?
Depends. In aggregate it comes off as a conspiracy, but all the testimony seems to suggest they were just throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what would stick. I don't think they'll find that Trump & cronies planned the Jan 6 violence, but they were aware violence could happen and used violent rhetoric with the mob anyway. The people central to the fake elector theme seemed to think they could justify it based on some obscure untried legal theory, but they also had other advisors telling them it wasn't legit. Asking Pence to refuse cerification was public knowledge and Pence refused publicly. All the court challenges were frivolous but I don't think they were illegal. For someone in the thick of it, it probably felt less like a coup and more like a lot of desperate people suggesting a lot of bad ideas.

Pence is fundamentalist-christian-crazy, but I don't think he's MAGA-QAnon-crazy, and he's definitely not Rebel-Against-The-DOJ-because-they're-the-deep-state-crazy.
The phase where indictment is appealed because it's unconstitutional for someone who holds leverage and threatens Senators. This will be appealed multiple times until the Supreme court agrees to put it on it's docket, later. When it comes up it is pushed back to the lower court where that judge is charged with bias because he has ethnic origins of someone Trump has publicly made vulgar statements about. An investigation is made into this judge and his name becomes a rally cry of extremist groups and he is forced to step down. A new judge is installed and there is a national discourse of this judge who makes a statement of impartiality despite owning 2 Trump memorabilia stores, a backer in a Trump golf course, and a condo in Trump's ass. He rules for Trump and the media and everyone watching has forgotten entirely what this case was and pin their hopes on Trump being indicted on charges of obstruction of justice for not providing evidence on a character assassination charge over a rape allegation that was ruled could move forward in 2018 and Trump publicly admits on social media that he knew her, he raped her, and that she was much more rap worthy back in the 90's.
Blah, blah, blah. How many phases are there? I can't keep track. This is just like the Trump is going to be indicted any day now headlines we have been hearing for years. I am not holding my breath that justice will ever be served.

Classification is complicated. Remember, some (not all, but some) of Hillary Clinton’s classified emails on a personal email account were on matters that were retroactively classified after the fact and weren’t yet classified when they landed in her inbox.

We don’t know if Biden’s documents threatened national security or if these were rather mundane documents — probably will never know unless the DOJ reviews and releases a broad summary, but my suspicion is if you looked at every corner of the federal gov’t, both parties, and all branches, it is probably not that uncommon that some very small degree of classified documents end up lost in other boxes/storage of other documents and get forgotten about.

That is not how it work. Biden returned the documents as soon as they were discovered- he get slap on risk.
The Charisma thing is a problem, but he also just doesn't seem to do well pushing back against other politicians criticizing him. He's a master at attacking easy targets like public education, public servants, public health officials, and Disney World, but I'm not sure he's going to be able to stand up to the social media pummeling that Trump will give him.
Why? Why on earth would he have a chance to “destroy” Biden? He celebrates literal every policy that fucked the GOP over in the last two elections. No one is going to buy that he’ll suddenly morph into a moderate if he’s put in the White House. Once the Election Machine really gets going, his every shit bag policy will be spread to every corner of the internet. He’s too Trumpish to appeal to Independents, but has none of Trumps showmanship!or charisma. Biden actually DOES have a lot of really good policies to hold up and have celebrated,’in addition to the incumbent’s advantage.

This. And the other thing us westerners need to get through our thick skulls is that they are always seeking to dominate. Always a zero sum game. There is no win win situation when dealing with them. "Win win" should always be be auto-translated to "we'll work with you because we're not strong enough to subjugate you....yet." Isn't it obvious? Look what they do to their own people.
That's the real strenh of democracy vs authoritarianism: it's much harder for one psycho to amass enough power to start tearing up treaties and changing the whole country's direction on a whim, and if it does happen it’s much easier for his enemies to restrain his excesses and boot him from power.

Yep, absolutely. Everyone is so outraged by the actions of Russia and China, and it is so easy to justify our offenses in their eyes. Doesn’t make what other countries do acceptable, but it does certainly negate the moral authority and superior we seem to regard ourselves with. The United States and Western countries have and will commit similar atrocities if it benefits us.
Claim that nazis were denazified, zombies put back in their graves, Jewish space lasers dismantled and the Martians are going back to Mars with all their tails between their legs and go home claiming victory. That's about on par with the bullshit their media spawns.
Tl;dr Russia doesn't have the industrial capacity to make competitive military hardware. It doesn't exist. So their GDP is not really relevant.

A pole once told me. "Most country's flags symbolize something with their colors. Like the french flag is blue for liberty, white for peace, and red for glory. Well ours does too. It's red for the russian blood we wish to spill, and white for the russian skulls we wish to stack.".

America couldn't occupy Iraq with only 200k (they ended up with over 500k) and that was after utterly crushing one of the world's best militaries in a few weeks, and with the majority of the local population actively supporting their presence. Russia never had a chance of occupying Ukraine, just maybe the land bridge to Crimea.

It's authoritarianism, but it's also vagueness used deliberately. By drafting intentionally vague laws, it lets them sell the laws to the public, and counter opposition, by claiming there are exemptions, but it also lets them prosecute people whenever they like. They want the benefit of a narrow law that only applies in some circumstances because that's what's popular and defensible, but they also want the benefit of a strict law because then they can punish people and feed red meat to the base. The vagueness lets them always blame someone else and say they did the wrong thing. If a woman dies, they can blame the doctor for not performing an abortion, but if that doctor had performed the abortion and the woman had lived, they could also say the doctor was wrong to perform it and prosecute.

If a doctor lets a patient die by not performing an abortion, they can blame the doctor, the hospital, etc, for failing to provide an abortion that was included in an exception. If, on the other hand, the doctor had performed the abortion, they could just as easily prosecute the doctor for performing a forbidden abortion. The vague drafting is deliberate, because it puts anyone who would provide abortions in a lose-lose situation, which can then be used to turn the public against them, or to bring them before a medical board and possibly lose their license to practice medicine.

If they wanted to, they could draft a law with clearly delineated lines, saying abortion is not allowed in these circumstances, is allowed in those, and is allowed in some others when it's necessary in the judgment of doctor. That they didn't draft these laws that way is intentional. They know how not to be vague, and they certainly have access to people outside the legislature who know how to avoid vagueness, but they chose to be vague anyway.

And put that up against Pelosi's record and she still comes out ahead. Delivering healthcare to tens of millions of Americans, getting the country out of two recessions, helping protect Americans from a pandemic, overseeing two impeachments and that's just off the top of my head.

fellow restaurant-worker-turned-IT here. On top of everything you've mentioned, I was a tipped employee so I don't even know how paid sick leave would have worked. Would they just pay me the average for that day? There's no way any restaurant would want to pay someone who stayed home from their own coffers, if you call out then they just call someone else in and the tips go to them.

Exactly! I was a food prep worker at a fast food restaurant, so I was one of the first to show up. I tried calling in sick, was told it was "unacceptable" and that I had to come in anyway. I later got fired for working too slowly, because I was sick. That same place made me push the issue when I noticed the 'fresh' chicken had a smell and had a weird, blue color. They didn't accept that it was bad until I told them a third time and refused to prep with it anymore. They still cooked and sold the stuff I'd prepped before that. (I'm not saying which company it was, because every store has different management some try to do better for their staff/customers.).

It's depressingly common. I'm currently over a year into litigation against a school that did this in PA, CEO said similar things regularly, i'm told average is 2-3 years to reach a settlement, in the best possible scenario. In the meantime, most employers won't touch me with a 10-ft pole. Also their only legal obligation in the end is for them to pay the difference between what I would've made at their job vs what I actually made instead. Would sure be nice if Biden and congress emboldened the NLB, and/or Shapiro and the newly Democratic state house made right to work laws a priority. As long as the entire system is stacked in their favor, employers will continue to act this way.

Exactly. Universities have raised tuition far in excess of cost of living causing the youth of America to do deep into debt instead of being able to grow the country. It has become a business and the kids are just consumers with no price limits.

In the ER you are entitled only to a medical screening exam. This can be from anyone licensed to do one. I’m an ER doc and Private equity backed contract management groups swept in and forced out every democratic physician owned group in our city in a 2 yr period. All started cutting physician hours and stretching their responsibilities. Queue the influx of PAs and largely under qualified/educated (fault of the system, not them before they jump on me) NPs. If you demand to see a MD/DO they may oblige but by no means have to and speaking from experience, any demands made to be seen by a certain person will start off the encounter on the wrong foot. That being said, if my loved one came to the ED for something serious or rare, I would insist they be seen by a doc😅. I would probably be better at knowing whether they were appropriately triaged though. I and for some things, say laceration repair, I’d actually prefer the NP to one of my Physician colleagues based on who has more recent reps.

It’s stupid, but it is what it is. I had a patient from Netherlands once, and I had to explain to him that I’m not asking his religion for discrimination of whatever it’s just standard practice, something that I needed to write down in the medical record for accountability. He said he’s an atheists, so I ask him if I can just put him down as protestants as they usually don’t have any restrictions for drug prescriptions or whatever, so it’s less of a hassle. He agreed and that was that.
Or, and hear me out, they’ll end up like me where they’re forced to bear the full weight of a lifetime of mental and psychological abuse from these kinds of parents and then turn to drugs as a way of coping and it’ll fuck them up even more until they’re 30 and have no idea what life will hold for them but know that it won’t be good probably.

1. Non-registered donors (“new donors”) take a couple of weeks to process before they can donate blood for the first time. There’s no certainty any of them will be a match for the child or eligible to be donors, and even if they are, they can only donate one unit of whole blood every 3-4 months each. If the child needs further transfusions before the donors can donate again the problem just comes back.
Because Erdoğan has demanded that it be the official name at the UN and for diplomatic matters. The English name is still "Turkey" but people who think that that makes them look smart use "Türkiye" now even though they shouldn't. Erdoğan and the Turkish people certainly wouldn't use "The United States of America" when speaking in their own language if Biden made the same demand at the UN. Actually, no Turkish people uses "Türkiye" when speaking in English, they're 100% aware how cringe it would sound. Reason for that demand from Erdoğan: "I'm a strong leader See I can force them to say "Türkiye" ".
exactly. every country uses their native names for places, because it's easier for them. imagine every country now demanding to use their way of writing or even their letters is just dumb.

Absolutely. Sometimes nothing happens, sometimes they don't like your face, want to make an example or want you out because your discourse threaten them and that's it, they'll throw things like "Attack on the Turkish identity" at you and you're done.
To be fair, wether one is religious or not, I think it is fair to try to respect everyone’s beliefs and assume that not every individual shares a congruent faith who believes in “god”. I can’t say “ all Muslims are X or all Jewish people are Y or all Christians are Z” without making a blanket statement inference. Religion has been the cause of many a people’s problems since the dawn of man but there are individuals who exist who follow a religion and are genuinely good individuals. And let’s not forget, it’s nor relegion itself that creates all this heinous, barbaric moments in time but also man himself who uses his religion and hand to bring down another human being. It takes both a concept / belief/.. aka religion.. and a modern day materialized body of flesh creature (human) for such atrocities to even happen. Many people have religion and want to live peacefully. It’s those in power who use it to their own discretion at the expense of the own people the govern that is the issue. When that women was killed in Iran (or wherever it was) by the religious police recently it became the people vs the government. Both sides mostly consisted of people sharing the same belief yet warring with each other. Going to war with people of religion would be an endless war. We can complain about it or we can find a way to live with each other. I.
The point is, this ideas can spread mostly because religion creates a fértile enviroment for then, if we teached people to think, to analyze and use method to build world views we would be faar more advanced as Societies (but to be fair its not a religion but a power thing). Instead we get irrational humans with ground beliefs that defy reality and logic.

These types of generalizations are completely unhelpful and only serve to drive Serbs away from the EU and towards Russia. Obviously the government of Serbia would not be involved in this type of plot, the risks would be far too great even if they felt inclined to do so. However, it's no secret that a substantial of the Serbian population has a pro-Russian sentiment and thereby serves as a potential recruiment pool for Russia.
Secondly, by saying things like "Ofcourse Serbia will help Russia", one is artificially pushing them towards Russia by creating sentiment among the pro-EU people that Serbia is "bad".

That does not mean "Serbia" is helping Russia, it means some Serbs may have been recruited by Russia. Big difference.

Crazy how back then us and the American used to be allies and now American kids are trying to justify hatred for Serbs because an Austohungarian national killed the Austrohungarian heir to the throne in a forcefully annexed region, which Austohungary used as an excuse to murder 3/4 Million Serbs in an attempt to expand their empire.

By voting against it in the UN? By not recognizing the breakaway regions of Crimea and Donbas? By Selling weapons to Ukraine? How exactly is it helping Russia?
Obviously, there are exceptions to this and some people more in the center or right also "speedrun". However, they more than sufficient to prove the rule, rather than contrast it.
in every thread that isn't even remotely related to the US there's at least one American that never left his hometown living his life existing his existence as a global politics expert fighting on the very frontlines of cyberspace from their mother's basement using the vast knowledge they've gathered from esteemed political subreddits to remind us: that no matter how many children die of hunger and medical malpractice in Africa or how many women are oppressed in the middle east and Asia (for the most serious and hereditary crime of being alive), it doesn't matter how widespread yet barely talked about corruption is in almost every European country, America is the worst country on earth.

Look! A republican asking for solutions. Your party has zero solutions, they arnt in that game. The only solution Your people want is a " final solution ".
Realistically, the corrupt officials will be replaced by other corrupt officials. There's too much money involved and too much power concentrated in key committees.

It's not just the fact that thousands of people died building these stadiums in the middle of a dust bowl that will just rot away after the tournament is finished, but the fact that Qatar also has backwards religious laws around women, homosexuality, and alcohol, the fact they've already went back on their word regarding a deal about beer in stadiums, and have already harassed and threatened to destroy the camera of a Danish journalist before the tournament even began, spells disaster.

Regarding the clothing laws, if they came to the West for a tournament and we said they had to follow our "culture and values" and expose their shoulders, arms, etc., they'd be up in arms.

Yes. There likely is at least some written communication between Gym/his lawyers and the Jan 6 committee providing his excuse for not complying with the subpoena. Throw the language back at him.

Really? What a waste of time, yes the Democrats went after Trump for January 6th but if the tables we're turn Biden would be in jail and not running for office again.

Exactly. Biden should cite the precedent they set of ignoring subpoenas and just ignore whatever else they say from there on. It’s like dealing with a toddler. Their tantrums don’t matter if you ignore them. They only become a problem if their parents cater to them whenever they throw one. The dems should let the GQP scream in a corner. Eventually they’ll tire themselves out and the American public will tune them out.

that’s actually physically accurate. While everyone has preferences, the vast majority of the time coffee tastes best warm/hot but not freshly boiled. After brewing it’s best to let it cool for a minute or two for the best flavour. It’s to do with thermodynamics and how individual coffee molecules behave at certain temperatures.

Considering that the Imperium and the Imperial Guard more specifically were, basically, based on an exaggeration of WW 1 and 2 Soviet tactics and army composition, the similarities aren't really that surprising.

50? This is permanent damage that will degenerate the country into another North Korea for multiple GENEREATIONS. Russia will never recover from this unless their entire state and political system, includibg the according people, are eradicated from the root and rebuilt. Which will never happen, given the history of the country.

If former President Donald Trump decides to use his newly reinstated Facebook and Instagram accounts he will be free to post election conspiracy theories and QAnon content without the likelihood of his account being banned again.
When it comes to other controversial topics, like casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election or sharing QAnon content, Meta says that it will take some action, but it won’t remove the offending posts or restrict Trump’s ability to post new updates.

IF china created a land mass and actually had a steady population on that landmass, it very much would in very real legal terms extedn their teritorial waters. there are also habited islands they claim ownership of that the philinines and other nations ALSO claim ownership of. IF no one else contested those claims.. be it through use of force, or trade/negotiation with the other countrys that claim ownership. then again there would be a very real argument for extending their teritorial waters.

This is hopefully the last and only time I ever say anything good about this monster, but in the most important moment of his entire life, faced with the most monumental decision he will ever make, he acted against a lifetime of programming and did the only right thing, when he had the opportunity and incentive to do any number of wrong things.

And here the answer is no - not as a nation. It is said there were no official Polish institutions (like governmental bodies), which supported Germans (in particular in antisemitic activities), that Polish (underground) institutions persecuted a collaboration with Germans in that regard (known as szmalcownicy), and while some Poles were responsible for such crimes- still they were crimes, and there are also numerous examples of completely different approach (like e.g. Irena Sendler).
Imperial Japan should repesent a very different warning; the horror of unaccountability, a refusal to take responsibility at any point, and how it just ends you up in the exact same horror show except no one wants to admit they got there because everyone who could have done something about it shirked the responsibility until it was too late.

You are right. In Poland we often remember the good, tolerant parts of our history, but we get very defensive when antisemitism, pogroms are mentioned.

I do agree that pre-war Poland could have done more to combat antisemitism, to foster integration. But I also don''t believe that any kind of policy would stop the industrial genocide brought by Germans.

Far too little far too late. Where was this energy in 2016? Where was the energy when the Republican Party literally had the ability to remove Trump from office? They had their chance to distance themselves from his rhetoric and chose not to. So why now?

They are all "I" and "me" instead of "we" and "us" when defining their version of America. All privilege and no responsibility. Which explains how Trump came to represent their party.

Yup. This is why many advised McCarthy not to do this; because it sets a precedent and opens the door to GOP getting swept right out next time they lose the House. Well, he did it anyway. So...he will reap what he sows.

Problem with that is it will lead to a pyrrhic victory - Russia can in theory send several million people and build several thousand newish tanks over the next few years. But doing so will completely demolish their economy for decades to come. It would be a prolonged death of Russia as a country as it means spending 50% of it's GDP on warfare rather than on... literally anything else. Doing so also means abandoning all other fronts and letting West to set the rules for countries like Armenia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Venesuela, Syria and so on which will be devastating long term as some of these are major energy resources exporters themselves.
Yes. Also like the Civil War faction but mostly like the country itself. There's been several Russias in the past (the most famous historical example being Kievan Rus) but Belarus was named Belarus before the other White Russians came to prominence. .

Considering Belarus political stance there also wouldn't be NATO assistance. Even for Ukraine we only started sending over gear few weeks into the conflict when we have realized it's actually possible for Ukraine to win and they were aligned with west. Belarus is not. It might get it's chance if Russia gets defeated in Ukraine and something happens internally that gathers their attention. Like their tsar dying creating a power vacuu,. In that case it could be possible (but still risky) to potentially do so without a massive loss of life.

Ultimately, America functions as a "Representative Democracy." We vote in officials who represent our ideas, concerns, and desires within the government. Even in the US, voters sometimes directly vote for laws in referendums. The representatives that the citizens elect make most choices for us because it is simply impractical to expect millions of people to meet at the local town square to discuss budgets, taxes, and construction. We elect the representative whose ideas match closest to our own to deal with these.

Sure, Article 5 doesn’t require military intervention, but the Polish people are the second-most Anti-Russian populace in Europe. If their President said Russia killed Poles with a missile, they’d be baying for blood. This response avoids that and saves face for everyone except Ukraine.

This is a bad narrative. The legal system is perfectly capable of acting quickly. Nearly everyday there is a new video of a police officer legally executing a citizen for an imaginary breaking of the law sometimes within seconds of encountering them.

Depleted? We have more weapons than the entire world. The budget is sky high. The weapons will never be depleted, unless of course the military budget is being siphoned away by people not actually spending it on the military, which is exactly how Rome fell btw.
Relevant excerpt: "Archaeological evidence suggests that the Israelites primarily emerged natively from Canaan. A number of scholars do not believe that the exodus has any historical basis at all, while only those on the fundamentalist fringes accept the entire biblical account "unless [it] can be absolutely disproved". The current consensus among archaeologists is that, if an Israelite exodus from Egypt occurred, it must have happened instead in the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt (13th century BC), given the first appearance of a distinctive Israelite culture in the archaeological record. The potential connection of the Hyksos to the exodus is no longer a central focus of scholarly study of the Hyksos, but this supposed connection to the Exodus has continued to inspire popular interest.".
For such a massive event that would have had social, economic, and cultural consequences ranging for hundreds of years across the region, there is zero archaeological evidence to back up the biblical accounts.

Are you insinuating that being attracted to trans people is perverse? I doubt it, but nonetheless your sentence frames it that way. But to your point, I think you're unhelpfully discounting what is actually a fairly important pattern in culture; closeted/unfulfilled people seeking access to the objects of their desires by indirect methods, because they don't feel like they can use direct methods. This often times manifests as becoming prominent social figures which allows them to compensate for their otherwise undesirable or dysfunctional personalities in order to get the things they want. Sexually abusive priests for instance. Do you honestly think it so unfathomable, that corrupt republicans would take advantage of their strangleholds in their territory to satiate sexual needs, regardless of the moral or legal aspects? This exact thing has happened many many times in this country already. And many times has a closeted Republican who is an outspoken bigot been outed in the midst of sexual deviancy.

One of the highlights of my senior year in high school (2000-2001) was reading Newsweek every week in my social studies class. 20+ years later I still remember their quality reporting on the 2000 presidential election. A damn shame what's happened to it.
The long and short of it is that Japan knew the war was lost but wanted better terms of surrender (they didnt like unconditional surrender at all), and were hoping to either get Russia as a neutral party to negotiate a deal between Japan and the US, or simply to stay out of the fight because they figured the brutal fight for the main islands would make the US rethink their goals and be willing to negotiate something less than unconditional surrender.

Honestly... I'm not so sure it is at this point. I mean, I guess there's biological and chemical, but Russia has launched kinetic missiles with no warheads for lack of conventional missiles. They're in dire straits if they want to win the war.

Not so. Every day Americans hear about and/or are affected by decisions of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, we now have a constant drip drip drip of reports about the current bench: Kavanaugh’s history of sexual abuse and rich white frat boy bullshit. Alito leaking decisions to supporters. Thomas’s wife fostering an insurrection but yet Thomas sitting on cases involving the same election. Barrett the inexperienced religious nut. Somehow the Chief Justice can’t figure who leaked the Dobbs decision. (I call BS.). Ergo, Americans no longer trust the Court. This already is not sustainable and the new documentary will likely push this court deeper into mud.

They are things like (paraphrasing from memory here) "It's not so bad, we have only a few cases and we'll get them taken care of" he cannot acknowledge how much of a threat it was, he has to say that he'll fix it because it is so minor, nothing to worry about. He staked his identity upon it. Then the Reich right wing media had to carry that perspective. Downplay how bad it is. Upshow how easy it is to cure it (just take hydroxychloroquine!).

Why? This change puts men and women at risk. Covid vaccines like all vaccines in general are safe and effective. Don't let the loud minority voices rule the military. do what's right.

If they're putting other prisoners to work in tank factories, I'm sure they could use them for logistics as well. I mean take this guy: doesn't really matter if it's true that he was in prison for illegal logging, but there are probably plenty of people from poor, rural areas that end up in prison for petty crimes like that. I know in Belarus you can go to prison just for being unemployed. And Russia has a 99% conviction rate. Russia is a HUGE country tens of thousands of square kilometers of woodlands that are barely inhabited. I don't think people there who are trying to make a living as loggers are necessarily hardened criminals that will steal everything they can get their hands on the minute you turn your back on them. Especially after having endured prison and being given the chance of earning a pardon.
Yes actually. Keep throwing Russians at Ukraine until they push through, and take land. They’ll just keep throwing soldiers until the they win or run out of soldiers. Or until someone makes a leadership change.

So yes, it is? That's what it sounds like. It's kind of ridiculous to me how we have special grand juries, special counsels, etc., all which are these elaborate processes that take forever and require insane amounts of resources and time... all for basically a report with which one person or some other tiny group of people use to make a final decision - which they can opt out of, anyway. It's all so redundant and promotes the idea that delayed justice is no justice. We seriously need to streamline our justice system. It's incredibly bloated. And I definitely appreciate that "the wheels of justice turn slow" and that it's intentional, and one of the better facets of this country... but it's almost as detrimental, IMHO, and the highest and most egregious criminals know it and abuse it. /rant.

> On 30 January 1933, Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor to head a coalition government; Hitler's far-right Nazi Party held two out of ten cabinet seats. Von Papen, as Vice-Chancellor and Hindenburg's confidant, was to serve as the éminence grise who would keep Hitler under control; these intentions badly underestimated Hitler's political abilities. By the end of March 1933, the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933 had used the perceived state of emergency to effectively grant the new Chancellor broad power to act outside parliamentary control. Hitler promptly used these powers to thwart constitutional governance and suspend civil liberties, which brought about the swift collapse of democracy at the federal and state level, and the creation of a one-party dictatorship under his leadership.
Not a single big fish was punished for 1/6. I actually don’t give a crap about the idiots who entered the Capitol. I care about who in the government planned it and was involved. They are the traitors (and I do not use that word too often).

Reality is constantly changing. The only way you arrive at the conclusion that standing still is the best solution is if your not really looking for a solution but rather conserving a bias.
Despite no longer being general secretary, Jiang still remained in charge of the military during the first year of Hu Jintao's term. Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference. A WikiLeaks transcript showed Hillary Clinton informing her private audience that China's foreign policy was ultimately controlled by their military establishment, not Hu.
They are doing OK? At least in the big cities. There's a difference between outlook and current status quo. Economic activities that generate cash flows are still going the same, paper money perhaps not so much. I've always told my relos off hand to sell up and move abroad if possible. Too much wealth tied up in real estate sitting under a huge demographic bomb.

Not necessarily. While the Saudi royal family is a very authoritarian regime they do make a strong effort particularly internationally to ensure that what they do does not overly affect the economic situation of the country as that would directly harm their personal wealth which is one of the leading drivers keeping them in power quite frankly. China sees maintaining its political strenh as that force.

Buddy. People flipped out because your threw your own intelligence agencies under the bus not because of these individuals. But turns out people were right . . . about your stupidity.

The testimony came in a Senate intelligence committee hearing that examined Russia’s intrusions in the 2016 election campaign and its intentions, with America’s top intelligence officials testifying just days after they released an unclassified report blaming Moscow for the hacks.

They don't care. Their side wants to rewrite our Constitution and undo any remaining vestige of a democratic republic. They are fully for the Oligarchy of America, which is similar to Russia (hence the support). In short, they're traitors.

It's transactional. He won't tell until someone makes him President again. So, he is basically bribing Ukraine yet again. Also, America. Quid pro quo, Clarice.

not only that but in 2016 the Russians hacked both the RNC and DNC servers, this is a known fact, but then they only released the dirt on Hillary and Dems, so either the RNC server's were clean as a whistle, or there was a little of compromising info on the GOP that the Russians have used to maintain Right wing support among the.

“Not since the Salem witches has a president been so hounded They come at me for everything (in a high-pitched whine, as if mocking a toddler having a temper tantrum) “You raped a woman in a Bloomingdale’s You colluded with the enemy You tried to steal the presidency” (dropping to his normal baritone register) These people look at one detail of one thing and think they understand everything. Bah” Trump nearly spit out the word, he was clearly working himself up.

Violent? Probably, but if he has lost influence with Republicans I don't think he is that dangerous, or at least not AS dangerous as he has been over the last 8 years, to the average person. If the worst he can do is throw violent fits and tantrums in private then that is a problem for people who choose to hang out with him.

Russia will not likely have sane leadership until sanity is restored to Russian culture, and even if the years of reality-distorting propaganda was to stop immediately, it will take many years for society, and government, to be deprogrammed. Just look at Putin - the most powerful man in Russia, with access to the world's information via the internet - a resource, like many aging Russians, he does not use, and was therefore entirely oblivious to the reality of conditions in Ukraine, and genuinely believed they were waiting for Russia with open arms. He's now faced with reality, and like many Russians, has just doubled down. And still, he browses the web through little binders of printed off info his advisors give him.
So there was like 7 min video of incident in vk (russian social network), where soldier argue with officer and telling him people don’t want to die without neither proper equipment nor any proper training, closer to ending of video officer tries to physically escalate either by unexpectedly closing by or throwing a slap (don’t remember exactly) for what soldier just push him away, after this physical interactions stopped — so soldier was literally sentenced for “beating” which is just one push which did zero harm to officer (except his ego).

I was thrilled when I heard. One of the biggest objections people had against Obama was his lack of experience on the world stage and here was a man who had decades of experience. I admired him for his strong character and steady hand.

Communist! You're about 30 years behind there. Text book fascist. Although, I have grown to realise it doesn't matter. They are all authoritarians and that is the only bit that matters.

Experience and diplomacy ave usually undervalued in politics. People do not stop to think that it takes years and a lot of effort to build relationships, to understand what motivates the other players, and months of day in and day out attendance in hearings to understand complex matters like waterways and transit, space programs, global trade and tariffs and so on.

I've wanted Biden since he ran against Clinton. You could just see that he was a clear eyed realist who had figured out how to put this country's best interests first. I love him.

I did. I canvased for her in July in Phoenix. I gave her money. I went to her fucking events and annoyed friends by insisting they go with me.

Exactly. King and Sanders have something to offer the Democrats. She's holding nothing they want. Play ball with her, she loses. Don't play ball with her, she loses. A Democrat has about an equal chance of winning whether or not Sinema runs independent, so they need to run a candidate. Any chance is better than no chance.

Wow, turns out the vast majority of Republicans/Republican-leaners will vote for the more right-wing candidate and the vast majority of Dems/Dem-leaners will vote for the more liberal candidate, leaving Sinema with a small contingency of enlightened-centrists/moderate Republicans who are mostly cool with LBGTQ people/Andrew Yang stans/“Third Way” PAC enthusiasts/big pharma execs…who woulda thunk it??
